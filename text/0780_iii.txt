1.  Background
1.1 

As part of an inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press, the Terms of Reference 
extend to a consideration of the extent to which the current policy and regulatory framework 
has failed, including in relation to data protection. It also requires a review of the extent to 
which there was a failure to act on previous warnings of media misconduct which undeniably 
includes the performance of the data protection regime. Data protection, with its origins in 
European and international law, is currently contained in the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) 
and is summarised elsewhere in the Report.1

1.2 

The UK data protection regime suffers from an unenviable reputation, perhaps not wholly 
merited, but nevertheless important to understand at the outset. To say that it is little known 
or understood by the public, regarded as a regulatory inconvenience in the business world, 
and  viewed  as  marginal  and  technical  among  legal  practitioners  (including  by  our  higher 
courts), might be regarded as a little unfair by the more well-informed, but is perhaps not so 
far from the truth. And yet the subject-matter of the data protection regime, how personal 
information  about  individuals  is  acquired,  used  and  traded  for  business  purposes,  could 
hardly be more fundamental to issues of personal integrity, particularly in a world of ever-
accelerating  information  technology  capability,  nor,  on  the  face  of  it,  more  central  to  the 
concerns of this Inquiry.

1.3 

It has the following features:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

The law identifies broad principles requiring businesses acquiring and using personal 
information to do so lawfully, fairly, accurately, for specific purposes and to the limited 
extent necessary for those purposes; the information must be kept safely and individuals 
have legally enforceable rights to know what information is held about them, to see it, 
and to ensure that it is accurate.
There  are  a  number  of  specific  exceptions  to  those  rights  and  principles,  including 
exemptions  designed  to  balance  those  rights  with  other  individual  rights,  such  as 
freedom of expression, and other public interests such as crime prevention.
The  regime  (along  with  the  regime  for  freedom  of  information)  is  the  responsibility 
of the Information Commissioner who has statutory power to investigate and rule on 
breaches,  and  enforce  compliance  (including  by  court  action  and  prosecution).  The 
Commissioner  also  has  a  wide-ranging  function  to  promote  awareness,  compliance, 
and good practice over and above the basic legal requirements, including by education, 
guidance, publications and reporting to Parliament.

1.4 

Successive Information Commissioners have worked hard and tirelessly to raise the profile 
of data protection within businesses, and to support public awareness, including by tackling 
‘myths’ and unnecessarily risk-averse behaviour, and promoting straightforward and common-
sense business practices.

1.5 

The Information Commissioner operates through an office (the ICO) and it was in the execution 
of these responsibilities that the ICO became involved in Operation Motorman. The public

facing narrative is described as part of the history2 in this Report but the way in which the ICO 
considered it appropriate to discharge its functions is far more complex than that narrative 
reveals. Having uncovered what appeared to be extensive unlawful or unethical practices of 
the press in the acquisition and subsequent use of private personal information from corrupt 
officials and private sector employees and through the medium of unscrupulous third-party 
‘blaggers’, a regulatory response was essential. How these challenges were approached, the 
political campaign that has followed and the extent to which insights can be learnt for the 
future is at the heart of this Chapter. 

Also  looking  to  the  future,  it  is  appropriate  to  move  from  a  consideration  of  the  specific 
to consider the way in which the ICO operates in relation to the press and, in particular, to 
review the relevant parts of the legal framework along with its powers and governance. 

Different parts of this Report have dealt with single systems. In relation to the activities of 
the press, the focus has been on the operation of the criminal law and the approach of the 
Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to press conduct. The relationship between the press 
and the police has been examined through the operational decisions of the police and their 
interaction with the press. For politicians, the issue has been the different dynamics of the 
way in which they react with the press and the extent of any impact on public life. For the 
ICO, all these different elements are engaged. This part of the Report deals with the criminal 
law, the regulatory regime of the ICO and the way in which it sought to engage the PCC, other 
regulatory options open to the ICO, and the political sphere (in relation to the amendment to 
the DPA). It is thus somewhat more complex and, given the wide ranging recommendations 
about  the  operation  of  this  statutory  regulator  with  an  extensive  remit,  has  required  a 
greater degree of analysis than other aspects of the Report: to that extent it is also different 
in approach. 

Having been directed by the Terms of Reference to consider the press and the data protection 
regime together, I have been conscious that the Report would be addressing matters relatively 
little noticed or debated in the public discussion of the Inquiry.3 I am also conscious that this 
subject matter has had relatively little scrutiny more generally. In this respect, as with many 
independent public inquiries, the task is to shine a light on an unfamiliar landscape. It is worth 
emphasising because so much of the rest of the material considered in this Report has been 
extremely fully ventilated, including editorially, as the Inquiry has gone along. The extent to 
which the relevance of data protection is and has been minimised is part of the background 
to this Part of the Report, as is the question of some of the reasons and motivations for it. I 
am also conscious that the discussion of this relatively unfamiliar territory throws aspects of 
it into relief in a way which may be a matter of surprise even to those more familiar with it. 
A fresh and independent perspective, by definition, is an opportunity for a different way of 
looking at things and perhaps of questioning some assumptions.

2.  The ico: structure, governance and approach 
2.1 

The Information Commissioner is a ‘corporation sole’ appointed by Her Majesty The Queen 
and  independent  of  Government  who  (like  the  senior  judiciary)  can  only  be  dismissed 
pursuant to an Address from both Houses of Parliament. He is funded by fees and grant-in-

2  Part E, Chapter 3
3 Although  the  evidence  from  the  two  Information  Commissioners  and  two  members  of  staff  was  heard  over  a 
comparatively  short  time  (occupying  one  full  day  and  less  than  three  half  days)  the  ripples  flowing  from  Operation 
Motorman were felt throughout the Inquiry and were the subject both of evidence and legal argument. Detailed and 
comprehensive expert evidence was also called. The extent of this analysis has meant that particular care has been taken 
to address subsequent submissions by the two Commissioners which dealt with more wide ranging considerations

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHaid voted by Parliament and supported through the Lord Chancellor and Ministry of Justice. 
Operationally independent, the full functions of the Office are exercised personally though 
the office holder who appoints staff who work by direct delegation from him. Between 2002 
and 2009, the Commissioner was Richard Thomas, a solicitor by training. He was based in 
offices in Wilmslow and had two deputies and the office now has over 300 staff (including 
lawyers and investigators). The operational investigations department reported to him via 
one of the Deputies. Francis Aldhouse, also a solicitor, fulfilled this Deputy role from 1984 (in 
the precursor organisations) until his retirement in 2006.

2.2  Mr Thomas described his approach in this way:4

(b) 

(a)  As  an  overview,  his  role  was  “partly  a  regulator,  partly  an  ombudsman,  partly  an 
educator and partly a policy adviser” the cornerstone being the duty to promote good 
practice including, but not limited to, compliance with the minimum legal obligations 
under the regime.5
The ICO was “primarily not a prosecuting authority. That was almost on the side”.6 The 
main formal power in the event of non-compliance was the ‘enforcement notice’, which 
could specify and require compliance action subject to the back-up sanctions of court 
enforcement, although this was not frequently used.
The principal power of investigation was the ability to serve an ‘information notice’ on 
an organisation to ascertain whether it was complying with the regime. This also was 
‘very, very rarely’ used because, in most cases, asking a business to co-operate and 
supply information usually sufficed. 

(c) 

(d)  Prosecution powers were limited to s55 of the DPA and did not extend, for example, to 
other offences such as phone hacking (although this might also technically involve a s55 
DPA breach).

(e)  Mr Thomas linked the application of the statutory ‘public interest’ defence provided by 
s55 to the core function of the ICO in freedom of information, in virtually every difficult 
case, in balancing public interest considerations for and against disclosure (on which it 
had published a great deal of guidance).7

2.3  Mr Thomas did not regard the ICO as “a regulator of the press as such” although the data 
protection  regime  applied  to  each  media  organisation  which,  therefore,  was  regulated 
and  fee  paying.  He  considered  the  exemption  contained  in  s32  DPA  (covering  personal 
information being used for the ‘special purposes’ of journalism, literature or art) as severely 
circumscribing and limiting the powers of the ICO in relation to the press, disapplying most of 
its enforcement powers where data is used for journalistic purposes while at the same time 
being ‘incredibly complicated’. He had rarely had to engage with the issue (because it ‘didn’t 
arise’) and did not consider it particularly relevant to the Inquiry.8 He considered that any 
journalist seeking to rely on the ‘public interest’ provision to disapply s55 would be expected

which he or she was proposing to rely, in order to be able to take any available advantage of 
that provision.

2.4 

From this short summary, it appeared that the ICO relied, in the main, on an informal means 
of doing business. That is usual regulatory practice. The ‘cornerstone’ function of promoting 
good  practice  was  largely  discharged  through  co-operation  with  and  encouragement  of 
businesses;  although  little  touched  on  in  evidence,  it  appears  that  this  was  also  the  case 
with the ICO’s complaint resolution or ombudsman function. It was not an organisation by its 
own account which regularly used its principal legal powers; prosecutions, in particular, were 
not its main business, but neither, it would appear, was direct regulatory enforcement. The 
main concern was prevention of poor practice and promotion of good practice. The Inquiry 
explored the extent to which the ICO was familiar with the press as an industry dealing in 
personal information, and with the specific aspects of the data protection regime applying to 
the press, and how it saw its role in relation to commercial journalism.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHChapter 2 
OperatiOn MO tOrMan

1.	 The	investigation
1.1 

The  background  and  history  of  Operation  Motorman  is  fully  described  above1  and  does 
not need repetition. When Alex Owens2 attended the search in Operation Reproof, he was 
well aware that the data protection regime fastens on the acquisition, use and disclosure of 
personal data by public authorities under compulsive powers. As well as the application of the 
criminal law, the principles and rights of the regime are designed to ensure that individual civil 
liberties are respected and safeguarded when individuals’ personal information is taken into 
the hands of public bodies, and that public bodies are strictly limited in terms of what can be 
done with that information and who can see it. Thus, although the focus of the police was the 
question of the corruption of public officials entrusted with people’s confidential information, 
the primary interest of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) was the information itself, 
and the consequences of the unlawful access and disclosure for the people whose information 
it was and for the organisation whose responsibility it was to take care of it.

1.2 

Having  identified  Steve  Whittamore  as  a  self-employed  private  detective  who  had  been 
requesting details from the DVLA in relation to a protected vehicle registration number, the 
ICO undertook the initiative to obtain a search warrant under its own powers. When it was 
executed, what was seized (over five-six hours) came to be referred to within the office as 
a ‘treasure trove’ or Aladdin’s cave in the form of a substantial quantity of documentation 
together with four colour-coded notebooks (‘the Motorman material’). These contained a 
very  large  amount  of  personal  information,  evidently  acquired  without  the  knowledge  or 
consent of the people in question. 

1.3  Mr  Owens  was  concerned  about  a  number  of  features.  First  was  the  sheer  quantity  of 
the information and how extensive and specific it was. Second, there was the fact that it 
appeared to have been obtained in the course of an investigative business spanning a period 
of  years  and  earning  considerable  sums.  Third,  the  evidence  suggested  that  the  material 
had been specifically requested and paid for by journalists writing for a significant range of 
newspapers and periodicals and related to a large number of well-known people (or those 
close to them), including household names from the world of entertainment, sport, politics 
and other arenas of public life. Finally, Mr Owens was struck by the nature of the information, 
including  personal  details  from  restricted  databases,  clearly  obtained  in  ways  which  were 
inconsistent with good data protection practice, with the legal rights and principles set down 
in  the  data  protection  regime,  and  even  in  some  cases  with  the  criminal  law.  During  the 
course of the search Mr Whittamore was present and although not formally interviewed, Mr 
Owens reported (albeit speculatively) that:3

“Whittamore made it very [clear] to me that whilst he would admit to his own wrong 
doing, under no circumstances would he say anything which would incriminate any 

1  Part E, Chapter 3
2  Mr Owens was the senior investigating officer in the ICO having previously spent 30 years as a police officer 
reaching the rank of Detective Inspector. He described having “special responsibility for the investigation of high 
profile or complicated investigations relating to breaches of the [then] new [Data Protection] Act.”: p1, http://www.

Hmember of the press. I was undecided as to whether this was because he feared the 
press or whether he anticipated some financial recompense in return for his silence.”

1.4  Mr  Owens  reported  back  to  the  senior  management,  briefing  both  Mr  Thomas  and  Mr 
Aldhouse. There are different recollections of discussions about the future handling of the 
material (which are discussed below). In the meantime, he began the laborious task of sifting 
the material and arranging for it to be placed on an electronic database. Although the lead 
came from a criminal investigation, the data protection aspects were apparent to the ICO 
with the ‘treasure trove’ they came upon taking them into a dimension of data misuse going 
far wider than specific issues of corruption which concerned the police. In fact, it appeared 
that the ICO had come upon an organised and systemic disregard for the data protection 
regime of a scale, duration and seriousness going beyond poor practice, beyond breach of the 
principles and rights of the regime, and into the realms of criminality in its own right.

1.5 

There was thus no doubt that the ICO, through Mr Owens, was preparing the Motorman 
material to form the basis of a prosecution under s55 DPA: they planned to prepare some 25-
30 of the more egregious cases for detailed investigation and selective interviews in order to 
found specimen charges against a number of persons who could include (a) corrupt officials 
and employees who were providing the information to Mr Whittamore directly for money; 
(b) blaggers, who were obtaining the information for him by deceit; and (c) the press, who 
were commissioning (or ‘procuring’ in the language of s55) the information in the first place. 
In that regard, counsel subsequently advised:4

“Having regard to the sustained and serious nature of the journalistic involvement in 
the overall picture, there can be little doubt that many, perhaps all, of the journalists 
have committed offences.
The inference, overwhelming it seems to me, is that several editors must have been 
well aware of what their staff were up to and therefore party to it.” 

1.6  When  it  came  to  Operation  Motorman,  Mr  Aldhouse  had  responsibilities  which  included 
providing direction to the head of investigations at the time (and so was formally answerable 
to Mr Thomas for the conduct of Operation Motorman). He said that it was not his role to 
direct investigations himself; rather, he had to supervise the person running the investigations 
department.5  His  own  focus  was  on  policy  work,  not  least  on  the  significant  European 
dimension to data protection, which often took him to Brussels. 

1.7 

Asked specifically about the operational issues which the discovery of the Motorman material 
raised for the ICO, Mr Aldhouse had no recollection of when he first heard about the case, 
nor of any internal meetings to discuss it (including those meetings at which the investigator 
Alex Owens alleged that decisive policy positions on the operational conduct of Motorman 
were taken by senior management). Mr Aldhouse himself said he never looked at the original 
Motorman  material,  nor  the  legal  advice  obtained  by  the  office  about  it.  When  asked  by 
Counsel to the Inquiry whether there was anything in the office at the time which was as big 
or as important as Operation Motorman, Mr Aldhouse accepted that, from an operational 
investigations  point of  view, it  probably  was the largest investigation.6 However, he firmly

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHmaintained  a  position  of  non-involvement  and,  hence,  non-accountability.  That  exchange 
included this:7

Q:  “I  think  all  I’m  gently  suggesting,  Mr  Aldhouse,  is  this  -  and  it’s  probably  fairly 
obvious now: we have possibly the most important investigation involving your office, 
Operation Motorman. It has very serious ramifications. It was clearly being ramped 
up at this stage. Mr Thomas had it in mind to make a report to Parliament shortly 
afterwards and he did. Surely you were involved, even in informal discussions with Mr 
Thomas, as to the direction your office was taking, weren’t you?
A: “Well, I think they would only have been casual ones...”

1.8 

These answers were consistent with his brief witness statement which suggested little in the 
way of senior oversight of operational matters at all. He said:8

“I am unable to comment on the detailed history of the Operation Motorman inquiry in 
the direction of which I was not involved. I believe that the investigators conducted the 
matter together with the Commissioner’s lawyers....I regret that because of my limited 
role in the Operation I am unable to help the Inquiry further.”

1.9  Mr  Aldhouse  was  also  asked  about  the  senior  structure  in  the  ICO.  He  described  a 
‘management  team’  comprising  the  Commissioner,  two  Deputies,  a  handful  of  Assistant 
Commissioners: ‘perhaps ten or a dozen very senior people’9. But this team does not seem to 
have been engaged in any decision-making about the Motorman case, either operationally 
or strategically. Was it not surprising that neither the responsible Deputy personally, nor the 
organisation’s senior management team, was consulted or engaged? Mr Aldhouse’s response 
was:10

“Am I surprised? I’m disappointed. Not necessarily surprised. ... well, yes, I’m sure in 
retrospect  it  would  have  been  -  one  could  well  say:  wasn’t  this  big  enough  for  the 
whole of the management team to be involved? ... I certainly had views, anyway, yes.”

1.10  As  will  be  clear,  despite  being  organisationally  and  functionally  responsible  for  the 
investigations  team,  Mr  Aldhouse  placed  himself  at  a  considerable  distance  even  from 
personal knowledge of the Motorman material. As Mr Thomas put it, with what appears to 
be a degree of understatement, “Francis was somewhat disengaged on these matters.”11 Mr 
Thomas himself, however, appeared to have grasped the implications, appreciated that it was 
very serious and congratulated Mr Owens and the team.12 He explained that, in what was the 
first year of his appointment:13

the underlying issue of the practices of the press

1005

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH“I was told about a “treasure trove” of evidence which the team had obtained under 
a  search  warrant  as  part  of  ‘Operation  Motorman’  …  There  was  a  feeling  that  the 
material was of sufficient quality and quantity to make this a major case which would 
bring home the seriousness of the [s55] offence.”

1.11  The assessment made by Mr Thomas of the Motorman material was that he saw it as “hard 
prima facie evidence ... of offences”,14 on a scale that could hardly have been greater for the 
data protection regime. He said:15

“So my understanding, I think, remains the case that this was a far more serious matter 
than a breach of section 55.”

1.12  Specifically, Mr Thomas apprehended that it was likely that that the journalists’ involvement 
in the acquisition and use of this information took them within the sphere of conduct so 
seriously at fault as to be prima facie criminal. Criminal conduct by journalists was the ICO’s 
‘very, very strong hypothesis’. This understanding was tested during his evidence,16 from which 
it appears that the following aspects of the Motorman material were particularly striking:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

Some of the material from the protected public databases could not have been obtained 
by lawful means at all, and appeared very likely to have breached specific statutory bars 
on disclosure.
It  was  known  that  Mr  Whittamore  did  have  corrupt  sources  in  both  the  public  and 
private sectors: these had been identified.
The pricing structure for the commissions was indicative of criminality because they 
were  either  too  low  to  suggest  that  it  had  been  obtained  lawfully  (because  of  the 
effort and time which would have been involved) or high enough positively to suggest 
a  premium  relating  either  to  incentivising  legal  risk  or  corruption  (with  some  cases, 
concerning very well known individuals) involving very large sums.
The circumstances suggested that it was highly likely that the journalists were knowing 
or reckless as to the unlawfulness of the means by which the commissioned material 
was acquired and that, on the face of it, it was unlikely that the s55 defence relating to 
the public interest would be available in the generality of cases.

1.13 

It  must,  of  course,  be  appreciated  that  criminal  proceedings  are  complex  to  mount  and 
involve a high standard of proof but, quite apart from criminality, Mr Thomas understood 
that serious questions were raised by the Motorman material and there were causes for real 
concern. In his fifth witness statement, he outlined the way in which the ICO had classified 
the 13,343 transactions recorded as follows:17

“(a) 5,025 identified ‘as transactions that were (of a type) actively investigated in the 
Motorman enquiry and ....positively known to constitute a breach of the DPA 1998.’ 
(b)  A  further  6,330  representing  ‘transactions  that  are  thought  to  have  been 
information obtained from telephone service providers and are likely breaches of the 
DPA. However, the nature of these is not fully understood and it is for this reason that 
they are considered to be probable illicit transactions’.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH(c) The balance of 1988 lacking sufficient identification and/or understanding of their 
nature to determine whether they represent illicit transactions or otherwise.”

1.14  Mr Thomas then put the matter in this way:18

“The classification of the transactions related to the apparent commission of offences 
… But I suggest that there must be at the very least ethical questions where a journalist 
is  the  regular  customer  of  an  investigator  who  commits  an  offence  to  obtain  the 
information,  whether  or  not  the  journalist  has  also  committed  a  procuring  offence 
in relation to that transaction. Such ethical questions are even more pertinent where 
… the investigator could obtain the information “more quickly and reliably than they 
[the journalists] were able to”, at least some of the information was of a confidential 
nature and Mr Whittamore was pressing to sell other pieces of information obtained 
for other clients.”

1.15  Mr Thomas was in no doubt that a significant proportion of the Motorman material did indeed 
constitute evidence of criminality, particularly in contravening specific bars on the disclosure 
of material from databases under the control of public authorities. As for the possibility of a 
defence under s55 DPA, he said, for example, that “I haven’t seen a whiff of public interest. 
It  was  tittle-tattle.  It  was  fishing.  There  may  be  one  or  two  examples,  but  they  would  be 
exceptional.”19 

1.16  He also made two further points. First, the theoretical availability of material by lawful and 
fair  means  did  not  by  itself  render  innocuous  the  acquisition  of  material  by  other  means 
which did, in fact, constitute breaches of the data protection regime. Secondly, at the very 
least, most of the material in question was not reasonably to be regarded as in the public 
domain, and therefore had a quality of confidentiality.

1.17 

I have no doubt that this analysis is both important and valid. It was for that reason that 
I  took  the  view  that  it  was  both  appropriate  and  correct  that  Mr  Owens  should  produce 
the Motorman material to the Inquiry but that (given the privacy of those whose records 
had been mined), it should be seen by the core participants under strict confidentiality and 
should remain in redacted form.20 Having said that, I summarised the effect of the evidence 
in this way:21

“It’s abundantly clear, looking at the electronic records, which you’ve checked against 
the actual documents, that Mr Whittamore had collected together a vast amount of 
personal data. The documents identify the names of titles and specific journalists at the 
titles apparently or inferentially making the request. It identifies the names of people 
from a wide range of public life and in the public eye, and provides addresses, telephone 
numbers, mobile telephone numbers and charging details for that information. It’s not 
necessary to go into the identity of the individuals, … it’s not necessary otherwise to 
identify titles or names and certainly not necessary to identify the persons who were 
the targets of enquiry. In relation to some of them, it is absolutely right that there may 
well be a public interest justification in the enquiry. In relation to others, however, it

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanHis difficult, if not impossible, to see what public interest justification there could be.”

1.18  A further point that Mr Thomas made was to recognise the possibility that the Motorman 

material was representative in nature. He said:22

“I  have  always  recognised  that  the  material  seized  in  Operation  Motorman  came 
only  from  one  group  of  investigators  and  may  have  been  entirely  isolated.  Equally, 
many other private investigators were known to be active and it is difficult to believe 
the investigators raided by the ICO were the only ones with press clients. This view is 
strengthened by the quite separate Goodman / Mulcaire prosecutions which came to 
light after the first ICO report and which had parallels with the section 55 offences and 
reinforced the evidence gathered during Operation Motorman.”

1.19  This  identifies  the  general  awareness  of,  and  concern  about,  the  security  of  confidential 
databases in both the public and private sectors, the sensitivity of the concentration in those 
databases of very large amounts of personal data, and the risks of that getting into the wrong 
hands.23 Albeit retrospectively, Mr Thomas also made the connection between the Motorman 
material and the subsequent evidence of phone hacking undertaken within the press24 as did 
Mr Owens.25 In any event, however, there was a clear apprehension of a general problem 
concerning unlawful and unethical trading in personal information, including, but not limited 
to, the press.26

1.20 

 In sum, therefore, Mr Thomas, and the ICO more generally, was aware that the Motorman 
evidence was an indication, in relation to the culture, practices and ethics of the press and 
beyond, of conduct that was likely to be criminal, probably constituted systematic breaches 
of confidentiality, privacy and the principles and rights of the data protection regime, was 
certainly  unethical,  and  was  “quite  outrageous  in  policy  terms”.27  As  summarised  in  the 
ICO’s  report  to  Parliament,  it  amounted  to  evidence  of  “a  flourishing  and  unlawful  trade 
in confidential personal information by unscrupulous tracing agents and corrupt employees 
with access to personal information”.28 The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in 
2003 described it as a “depressing catalogue of deplorable practices”.29 The modus operandi, 
and the harm done, was well understood.30 How it was addressed by the ICO now falls to be 
considered.

regard, it is noteworthy that he was at pains in his evidence to the Inquiry to distance himself 
from the operational decisions made about Motorman; effectively, he disclaimed significant 
contemporaneous knowledge of the operational management of the case. It is also striking 
that, as Mr Thomas was aware, his Deputy, Mr Aldhouse, also distanced himself from the 
operational management of the case.

Although  aware  that  a  wealth  of  material  had  been  recovered,  Mr  Thomas  had  little 
recollection of the briefing or of discussing the detail. He emphasised that the question of 
investigating the role of journalists and newspapers in the events “was not a matter with 
which in any way I was engaged”;31 at the time “I can’t really say that I was giving very active 
consideration to these matters”;32 and “I personally did not give any serious consideration to 
that matter, and I cannot recall any conversation or discussion when that particular issue was 
being discussed”.33 He said, for example, that it was only as a result of being asked to assist 
the Inquiry that he had latterly become aware that the MPS had investigated journalists as 
part of Operation Glade, of the note made by his office of their meeting with Counsel on 3 
October 2003 advising that there were grounds in the Motorman evidence for proceeding 
against journalists,34 or that the judge hearing the Motorman prosecutions at Blackfriars had 
questioned the lack of proceedings against any journalist.35

I  must  admit  to  being  surprised  about  the  extent  to  which  Mr  Thomas  distanced  himself 
from the practical details of the operation that was later to take up so much of his attention 
politically. By his own account he did not direct the operational strategy, involve himself in 
key decisions or, it would seem, keep himself especially closely briefed. One of the earliest 
notes of his reaction was a handwritten entry in a personal notebook36 written between 3 and 
10 March 200337 recording: “Francis – Newspapers/s55”. Unable to recall any conversation 
with Mr Aldhouse, Mr Thomas was pressed as to whether this did not suggest a personal 
interest in the press dimension to Operation Motorman. But he remained firm: he personally 
did not give any serious consideration to the operational dimension. He ‘assumed’ that an 
operational decision would be taken at the level of Mr Owens and the in-house legal team, 
about whether and to what extent to pursue action against the press. Put to him that he must 
at least have been aware that no journalist was being prosecuted, that he must at least have 
been alert to the criminal process, he replied that that was only in very general terms. There 
were, he pointed out, ‘many, many other matters going on at that time’.38 

2.4 

The  ‘Newspapers/s55’  note  might,  at  least,  be  thought  to  suggest  that  Mr  Thomas  was 
concerned with the criminal process. It is to that issue that most if not all references to his 
assumptions about the operational management of Motorman are made in his evidence.39 
He stated, for example, that:40

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH“It was my understanding that the case would be pursued in line with established Office 
practice – prosecutions led by the in-house legal team, advising and acting upon the 
evidence obtained by the Investigations Unit. I was subsequently kept broadly abreast 
of developments, notably that the CPS were taking over the prosecutions [this is, of the 
private investigators] and then that trial had resulted in major disappointment. The 
ICO lawyer with lead responsibility was Phil Taylor.”

2.5 

2.6 

The  Motorman  material  had  emerged  in  the  course  of  a  criminal  investigation,  but  its 
implications  for  the  data  protection  regime  were  much  broader  than  that.  There  is  no 
indication,  however,  that  aspects  other  than  prosecution  were  actively  being  considered 
within the ICO. It is difficult on the face of it to understand why not: that question is considered 
in some detail below. 

Both in law and in terms of the reputation of the ICO, operational decisions, especially any 
involving the press, would have been complex and significant, and Mr Thomas was ultimately 
accountable for them. Motorman was not a simple operational issue: it was an indication of 
data protection breaches and poor practice on an unprecedentedly large scale and driven by 
the newspaper industry. It obviously engaged the ICO functionally and could have reputational 
consequences.  In  addition  to  criminal  proceedings,  there  was  a  spectrum  of  powers  and 
functions which, at any rate potentially, could be engaged, in different combinations. These 
are  considered  in  more  detail  below.  Given  the  inherent  risks  in  criminal  proceedings, 
contingency planning was also in question. In other words, there were strategic decisions to 
be taken in considering the operational response to Motorman which could only be taken 
effectively at the level of strategic overview. However those in a position to take that strategic 
overview of operations emphasised to the Inquiry that they were not doing so.

2.7 

In addition to operational responses there were political possibilities and it is these that Mr 
Thomas focused on. His strategy was to take a twin-track approach, consisting of initiating a 
dialogue with the Press Complaints Commission and undertaking a campaign to persuade the 
government to change the law to introduce custodial sentence maxima for s55 of the Act. In 
some ways, Mr Thomas characterised this as in itself an operational response:41

“I think we were using our powers to promote good practice. That was a far more 
general power, and you know, that was the justification, the rationale – the statutory 
foundation for much of what we did was promoting good practice. I would describe 
pretty well everything we did in this area as promoting good practice.”

2.8 

There were, however, risks in the extent to which the most senior staff were at a distance 
from the specifics of the operational response to Motorman. The first was that the strategic 
approach adopted would be insufficiently informed by detailed operational knowledge and 
understanding of the problem revealed. The Motorman material was a very rich resource 
of empirical evidence of the nature and scale of the presenting problem, and any strategic 
solution was likely to have been importantly enriched by expert analysis of that information 
in  the  context  of  the  industry  in  question.  The  second  risk  was  that  the  political  and 
operational responses would be insufficiently well co-ordinated for the maximisation of the 
effectiveness of each. Decisions made in one context might well be capable of affecting the 
other at least at a handling level. Mutual knowledge and understanding would be important 
resources for both. Finally, the third risk was that if the top of the office did not sufficiently 
communicate with or engage the operational part of the office about the political strategy,

1010

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHoperational decisions might be taken on the basis of weak knowledge or assumptions about 
the operational implications of the political strategy.

2.9 

As for the distance that Mr Thomas kept from operational decision-making in Motorman, he 
put his own frame of mind in embarking on his twin-track political strategy in this way:42

“My speculation is when I was told some time in October or November [of 2003] that 
it was going to be too expensive or too difficult to pursue the journalists, that’s when I 
went off to the Press Complaints Commission. But throughout that period from March 
to October, as far as I was concerned, it was being handled in what I can broadly call 
the normal way by those who were charged with enforcing Section 55.”

2.10  This speculation does not seem to be strictly accurate. At the time, with the assistance of 
Counsel, the investigations officers evidently continued actively to consider the possibility 
of  criminal  proceedings  in  relation  to  the  press.  The  availability  of  civil  investigation  and 
enforcement powers also fell to be considered in the alternative in any event. In other words, 
Motorman, remained a live operational issue for the ICO at the time Mr Thomas embarked 
on his political strategy; there were therefore risks both to it and to his own plans.

3.	 The	approach	to	the	PCC
3.1  Mr  Thomas  was  clear  that  it  was  his  personal  decision  to  approach  the  PCC;43  this  was 

reinforced by his Deputy, Mr Aldhouse. In oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Aldhouse said:44

“I do recall that Richard Thomas decided that he wanted to pursue the route of going 
to the Press Complaints Commission and writing to Sir Christopher Meyer, but I have 
to  say  I  think  that  was  Richard  Thomas’s  decision  rather  than  the  result  of  some 
discussion.”

3.2 

Pressed as to whether he would not have expected, as Deputy, to have been involved, he 
said he would, but he was ‘otherwise engaged’, including in Brussels. Although Mr Aldhouse 
saw his own role as somewhat dissociated, given the policy ramifications that the Motorman 
case might throw up and the potential cost implications for the ICO, when asked whether it 
was strange that he was not at least involved quite closely in discussions with Mr Thomas, his 
response was:45

“What can I say? It’s for the Commissioner to decide how he runs the office. If - and it is 
worth bearing in mind, of course, that it is - that the Commissioner is a one-man band 
and if the Commissioner decides to take a route, so be it.” 

3.3 

In  the  event,  on  4  November  2003,  Mr  Thomas  wrote  personally  to  the  Chairman  of  the 
PCC, then Sir Christopher Meyer.46 He explained that his idea had been to ‘go collectively’

rather than individually to the press.47 This gives rise to a number of issues. First, what his 
understanding of the role and functions of the PCC was (and how that developed); second, to 
what extent he understood the PCC to be a representative of the press collectively and to what 
extent a regulator of the press (two very different propositions); and third, how he judged the 
ICO and PCC would relate to each other functionally and how he managed that relationship. 
The resolution of these leads to the overarching question about the objectives in approaching 
the PCC, whether they were appropriate and how effectively were they achieved.

In relation to his approach and objectives, Mr Thomas was looking at these at a high level and 
generic nature which was some distance from the immediate operational issues faced by the 
ICO. He did not have it in mind to ask the PCC to investigate the specifics of the Motorman 
material or the conduct of the press (although he does not appear to have resolved how 
an investigation would be handled if at all within the ICO). He wanted a general, forward-
looking  exercise,  conducted  across  the  industry  as  a  whole,  with  a  view  to  putting  a  halt 
to the practice of commissioning unscrupulous private investigators to obtain confidential 
personal  information  without  regard  to  whether  means  such  as  blagging  and  corruption 
were  used.  He  considered  that  this  would  principally  be  achieved  by  issuing  a  prominent 
and general condemnation of the practice and securing appropriate changes to the Editors’ 
Code.48  There  is,  however,  no  clear  indication  of  how  Mr  Thomas  thought  condemnation 
by the PCC and changes to the Code would definitively terminate the practice, nor of what, 
if any, complementary action would be necessary or desirable on the ICO’s part to achieve 
that result.

  Mr  Thomas  was  also  concerned  about  the  tone  of  his  approach.  He  wanted  to  make  a 
‘constructive and friendly’49 overture to the senior leadership of the PCC. He evidently had 
in  mind  that  a  ‘good  relationship’50  would  be  important.  There  was  to  be  an  element  of 
outreach and informality, so lunch meetings were contemplated, Mr Thomas would attend 
on  the  PCC  so  far  as  location  was  concerned  (a  concession  inevitably  constrained  by  the 
location of his premises in Cheshire), and formal or agreed notes were not expected. In other 
words, Mr Thomas intended to conduct the relationship himself, at a personal level and in a 
personal manner.

The letter51 drew attention to a recommendation of the Parliamentary Culture, Media and 
Sport Select Committee that the Editors’ Code should be amended to include explicit bans on 
payments to the police for information and on the use and payment of intermediaries such 
as private detectives. The letter outlined the Motorman findings and the Metropolitan Police 
investigations. It stressed the considerable volume of material uncovered; the indication that 
journalists from most newspapers and many periodicals were customers of Mr Whittamore; 
and that numerous journalists routinely obtained confidential information that ‘they should 
have  no  access  to’.  It  suggested  that  this  material  was  being  obtained  in  the  service  of 
celebrity gossip, not to expose wrong-doing, and that the sums involved and the nature of 
the documentation made it ‘difficult to believe that senior managers were not aware of what 
was going on, and were therefore at least tacitly condoning it’.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH3.7 

The letter also indicated that the ICO was considering whether to take action under the DPA 
against individual journalists and/or newspapers. It was put to Mr Thomas by the Inquiry that 
this was an empty threat; he resisted the idea that it was a threat of any sort, on the basis that 
he intended the letter to be a ‘constructive and friendly opening in my engagement with the 
Press Complaints Commission’ but he did accept that ‘it may have been somewhat overstating 
the case’.52 It suggested however that the ICO had provisionally concluded that it would be 
appropriate first to give the PCC and its Code Committee the prior opportunity to ‘deal with’ 
the issue in a way which would put a stop to the ‘deplorable’ practices across the media as a 
whole. It envisaged that the ICO would provide some of the Motorman material to the PCC 
and that the PCC would respond with a suitable change to the Code; this could provide a more 
satisfactory outcome than ‘legal proceedings’ and would also, it was suggested, be consistent 
with Sir Christopher Meyer’s wish expressed to the Select Committee to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the PCC.

3.8 

In the light of all that has been said about the PCC, it is significant that the letter addresses 
the relationship between the ICO and the PCC as Mr Thomas saw it. Intending to discuss the 
relationship, he said:53

“I believe it would  be to our mutual  advantage to meet at an early opportunity  to 
discuss the matters raised in this letter and, more generally, our respective roles and 
the relationship between our organisations.” 

He also indicated that:

“though I do not wish to usurp your role as the regulator of the press - newspapers, 
and their employees, are subject to the Data Protection Act 1998.”54

3.9  Mr  Thomas  was  surely  correct  to  suggest  that  the  respective  roles  and  responsibilities  of 
the  two  organisations,  namely  the  statutory  data  protection  regulator  and  the  industry’s 
voluntary body, would be an important issue. The obvious asymmetry made it so. The ICO 
had legal functions and duties to be discharged in relation to the matter of how businesses 
acquired and used individuals’ information; the PCC did not. It is inevitable therefore that Mr 
Thomas’s approach would have had to have been at the level of seeking to elicit the voluntary 
cooperation of the PCC rather than making a claim on any complementary or overlapping 
formal legal jurisdiction.

3.10  Mr Thomas’s letter suggested a meeting within days at the offices of the PCC; he approached 
that meeting in a structured way, preparing a speaking note55 setting out his evident hope 
that the PCC would respond with a ‘general condemnation’ and changes to the Editors’ Code. 
The  meeting  took  place  on  27  November  2003,  Sir  Christopher  was  accompanied  by  Guy 
Black (then the Director of the PCC, now Lord Black of Brentwood).

3.11  Mr Thomas said that, initially, the PCC had at first not really known why the ICO had approached 
them, but that the atmosphere changed as he set the matter out and he convinced them a 
serious matter was in issue and that the two organisations would work together to deal with 
the problem.56 His subsequent written notes stated:57

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH“The PCC would like time to consider their response. They were clearly surprised by 
the scale and nature of the material we have collected and see this as a ‘watershed’ in 
terms of this sort of activity.
“Although  this  was  not  suggested  by  us,  they  would  be  resistant  to  ‘taking  over’ 
individual  cases  and  taking  action  in  each  case  instead  of  us.  Their  starting  point 
was that statutory bodies should enforce the law, not them. But they seemed to be 
increasingly ready as the meeting progressed to work with us as ‘fellow regulators’ 
with a strategic response. This might lead to some sort of general condemnation and 
– though there are some difficulties – an amendment to the Code.
“It is for them to identify precisely what they might do, and they recognise this. They 
want a second meeting before Christmas.” 

3.12 

It is somewhat surprising that Mr Thomas appears to have seen a measure of equivalence 
between the roles of the ICO and the PCC, if not actually of deference to the latter. In oral 
evidence he explained that “I think we were both very proud of independence, I’m sure”,58 
and  he  noted  to  himself  after  that  first  meeting  that  it  had  been  “constructive  –  ‘fellow 
regulators’”. In the circumstances, I felt driven to ask:59

“What are you relying on as concluding that the Press Complaints Commission was a 
regulator? You’re a regulator, but you’ve concluded here that they’re a regulator, or 
asserted that they’re a regulator. I’m just interested to investigate your understanding 
of that.”

3.13  The response from Mr Thomas was that the PCC called themselves a ‘self-regulatory body’ 
and confirmed that at that point he certainly saw them as such; and therefore as likely to 
be ‘intelligence-driven, proactive, mainly focused on either prevention or punishment’. He 
had drawn parallels with the Advertising Standards Authority and the banking and insurance 
ombudsman schemes with which he was familiar from his previous career, and saw the PCC 
as, like the ASA, able to intervene and take action to prevent unacceptable behaviour. It was 
with that expectation that he had approached Sir Christopher. The PCC was ‘supposed to be 
in charge of the press, they ought to know what’s going on’60 and, indeed, to stop it.

3.14  Mr Thomas accepts now that this was a misconception. In oral evidence to the Inquiry he 

confirmed that:61

“I did see them and they held themselves out as a regulator and I think experience 
showed that they were not a regulator in the conventional sense.”

He went so far as to suggest that the inadequacy of the PCC to the task he had envisaged for 
it formed a part of the dialogue:62

“I  can  recall  saying,  you  know,  ‘Why  can’t  you  transform  and  change  the  Press 
Complaints Commission to make it look more like the effective self-regulation models 
I’ve encountered elsewhere?’”

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH3.15  His current understanding was that the PCC was essentially a complaints handler, with functions 
focused on the investigation of complaints from the public. That leads to the question of the 
steps he might have taken to ascertain the position at the outset, or as his understanding 
of the PCC developed over time, not least bearing in mind his express placing the question 
of the relationship between the two bodies on the agenda at that original meeting. This is 
important because the assumption of equivalence (or deference) with which he mistakenly 
embarked on the initiative with the PCC could have had direct implications for decisions the 
ICO might otherwise have made about the exercise of its own powers and functions. That, as 
well as Mr Thomas’ personal distance from the operational issues raised for his office by the 
Motorman data, put him in an unsatisfactory position in embarking on this enterprise. 

3.16  Furthermore, although the initial letter expressly put the question of respective roles and 
relationships on the agenda for discussion with the PCC, it is evident that the opportunity 
was not in fact taken to clarify that fundamental question. Mr Thomas was specifically asked 
whether the role of the PCC was described and his perception discussed and corrected.63 His 
response was that over the course of his interactions with Sir Christopher ‘we’ve probably 
touched on some of these matters’. Given the significance that Mr Thomas attached to this 
approach that cannot, in the circumstances, be considered a satisfactory basis on which the 
ICO, as a statutory regulator, ought to have made any decisions about respective roles and 
responsibilities. The likely explanation for (and consequences of) this is considered below. 

3.17  Sir Christopher’s own account of that first meeting was more highly coloured. He was evidently 
interested in what he heard about Motorman: he characterised the ICO as describing a ‘fairly 
apocalyptic situation’,64 leading them to expect court action in relation to the press (which did 
not materialise), but principally in getting to the data underlying the issue:65 

“I wanted beef. I wanted red meat, Mr Jay, and he didn’t give it to me.” 

This, on his account, would have enabled the PCC to ‘have gone into some kind of action with 
the newspapers in question’ and to sharpen and hone their guidance to the press. In the 
light of the way in which Sir Christopher dealt with Operation Caryatid, it is not obvious what 
might have been done but, although his letter had held out the prospect of some limited 
disclosure of material, Mr Thomas was clear in his own mind that his purpose was not to 
ask the PCC to investigate individual cases. In any event, the PCC was equally clear that they 
could not look at cases from unidentified victims: this could have been a clue as to the PCC’s 
quintessentially complaint-handling function. 

3.18  Sir Christopher’s appetite for beef, therefore, was evidently related at least in part to seeing 
the proof of the message he was being given. Pressed as to whether the PCC could not simply 
have taken on trust the ICO’s indication of the extent of the problem without the underlying 
data, Sir Christopher’s answer was that while of course it could be assumed Mr Thomas would 
not have made the allegations without some substance, they never saw the substance or the 
expected litigation.

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH3.19  Sir Christopher also describes telling Mr Thomas that he was the Information Commissioner 
and should “get on with it. Prosecute these guys”, noting that “And prosecutions came around 
none, ever, in my time, anyway.”66 This reaction is echoed in Mr Thomas’s own note where he 
records the PCC as emphasising ‘not our role to enforce law, not arm of ICO’.67 

3.20  The refusal of the PCC to take any action while criminal proceedings were pending or possible 
was also made plain;68 this was a position which Mr Thomas on his part made very clear he 
did not accept, but from which the PCC refused to move. The message from Sir Christopher, 
in other words, was that the Motorman evidence was ICO business rather than for the PCC; 
they were prepared to help as far as they could, but needed more to go on.69

3.21  The reaction (that the PCC wanted details of the underlying data and decisive action from the 
ICO before it could act) continued to set the tone and might be viewed as an early warning of 
the extent to which the PCC was either unwilling or unable to deliver what Mr Thomas hoped 
to achieve. It might (but did not) cause a reconsideration of his investment in the twin-track 
strategy of approaching the PCC and the government, but without at the same time attending 
closely to the operational response itself. 

3.22  A  year  passed  with  little  progress.  Mr  Thomas  described  the  joint  effort  to  produce  a 
guidance note as seeming to “sort of grind to a halt in April of 2004”.70 He wrote to the PCC on  
8 December of that year expressing concern that the work had ‘run into the sand’,71 and that 
there was consequently a real risk that the problematic practices would continue unabated. 
This comment is particularly significant because if the ICO apprehended that there was a real 
risk of continuing unlawful conduct after the Motorman seizure there was again no indication 
that  this  was  the  subject  of  any  reassessment,  either  of  the  PCC  strategy  itself  or  of  the 
operational response and options within the ICO. A whole year had elapsed since the first 
approach  to  the  PCC,  two  years  since  the  seizure  of  the  Motorman  material.  These  were 
potentially very serious matters, and the PCC strategy had yet to bear any fruit. Mr Thomas 
explained that he did not ‘lose all faith’.72 In the circumstances, the basis of that faith and his 
continued reliance on it are increasingly hard to understand.

3.23  Both sides appear to have thought that the matter had become bogged down in legal details, 
including over the matter of the effect of the public interest exemption in s55 of the DPA in 
relation to actual or potential criminal liability of journalists. Mr Thomas put it to the PCC 
in  his  letter  that  he  was  strongly  of  the  view  that  inaction  on  their  part  would  show  the 
‘principles of self-regulation in a poor light’.73 If his intention was to suggest either that the 
PCC risked its own credibility politically, or that the industry risked direct regulatory action 
from the ICO, there is no evidence that Mr Thomas had any particular basis for making such 
a suggestion.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH3.24  On 15 December 2004, Sir Christopher replied74 indicating that he was going to “resurrect” 
the project with a view to approving a note the following February. He made it clear, however, 
that the key objective of the note from the point of view of the PCC was to assist journalists 
in understanding how to comply with the DPA: that would be ‘most welcome’. A very brief 
was issued (‘probably in the spring of 2005’)75 but evidently with little impact; it contained no 
reference to Operation Motorman and no warning to journalists.76 

3.25 

In evidence, Tim Toulmin (then the Director of the PCC) agreed that “there was no attempt 
by the PCC in 2005, through its guidance, specifically to warn the press of what they should 
do in the future by reference to what they might have done in the past.”77 His view was that, 
given that the PCC was ‘a complaints body looking at breaches of the code of practice rather 
than the Data Protection Act’, there was some question about whether it should even have 
issued the note it did, but ‘it did want to be helpful’. The PCC had regarded it as ‘pretty much 
outside its remit’ and required a specific decision from its board to proceed with the matter 
at all. Mr Toulmin also agreed with the proposition that the PCC’s view was: “Well, there isn’t 
a specific complaint here, therefore our powers aren’t engaged and we’re only going to take 
second place to the Information Commissioner, who is the real regulator in this area”.78 

3.26  Mr Toulmin also said:79

“The  question  was,  I  think,  where  the  different  responsibilities  lay.  The  PCC,  as  a 
platform for discussing the behaviour of journalists and so on in another context, which 
was about the application of the code of practice, was happy also to say, “By the way, 
Richard Thomas has this campaign about the Data Protection Act and he’s right to do 
so”, but beyond that, it was difficult really to know what the PCC could do.” 

His conclusion was that Mr Thomas should have engaged directly with the industry, the trade 
bodies or straight to the Code Committee (as being ‘more representative of the industry’) 
and not to the PCC at all: it did not have the right remit.80 Throughout this period, however, 
there was still no evidence that the ICO was either successfully managing the relationship 
with the PCC towards its stated objectives, or assessing the alternatives.

3.27  The next step was the publication by the ICO of What Price Privacy81on 10 May 2006; the ICO 
included the PCC in its distribution list. A response (described with conscious understatement 
by Mr Thomas as “disappointing”) came on 31 May in a form acknowledged by Sir Christopher 
as a bit “sneering”. It was in these terms:82 

“Thank  you  for  sending  me  a  copy  of  your  report,  What  Price  Privacy?  It  was  an 
interesting read. I am sending you a copy of our annual report, which we have just 
published, along with the text of a speech I gave last week in which I refer to your 
remarks about the PCC.

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanHI think that, as a next step, it would be helpful if we organised a meeting so that we can 
explore what more it is that you think the PCC can do. You will appreciate that your call 
for us to act came rather out of the blue, and we have no material to work with other 
than what you put into the public domain in your report.
Perhaps someone in your office could be in touch ... to arrange a suitable time.”

3.28  The  enclosed  speech  was  largely  a  celebration  of  the  achievements  of  the  PCC,  and 
immediately before closing with the claim that ‘15 years of the PCC has changed the culture 
of an entire industry’, dealt with the ICO in two short paragraphs which strongly suggested 
that it had reached the limits of the action it was prepared to take:83

“There is one issue not touched on in the Report which merits an observation. Recently, 
the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, wrote to me, as he did to members 
of the newspaper and magazine industries, about the suborning of people by agencies 
paid by publications to obtain confidential information. This is something that I have 
intermittently discussed with Mr. Thomas over the last two years or so. It was as a 
result  of  our  exchanges  that  the  PCC  published  last  year,  in  collaboration  with  the 
Information  Commissioner’s  office,  an  advice  note  to  journalists  about  the  Data 
Protection Act and how it impinged on their profession.
“Part of the purpose of the note was to remind journalists that offering money for 
confidential  information,  either  directly  or  through  third  parties,  was  illegal.  Mr. 
Thomas is clearly concerned that this is a practice which continues. He would like the 
PCC to do something more about it. I intend to tell him once again that we can and do 
urge on journalists respect for the law – bribery has no place in journalism. I will go on 
urging. And I look forward to discussions with Mr. Thomas about what more he thinks 
the PCC can do about this within the self-regulatory framework. But clearly it would 
not be viable simply to duplicate the criminal law in the Code of Practice.”

3.29  This  did  not  prompt  a  reassessment  of  the  strategy,  but,  on  13  July,  a  further  meeting 
between Mr Thomas and Sir Christopher took place. The ICO note of the meeting84 identified 
as key issues the PCC response to What Price Privacy?, support so far and next steps, along 
with ‘the respective roles and responsibilities of the PCC and the code of practice committee 
of editors’. Sir Christopher was reported to have said that ‘the PCC is not able to act as a 
general regulator. He believes that what is needed is a strong stance from the ICO including 
prosecutions. He queried what more the PCC could do.’ The ICO considered that the PCC’s 
role was to come up with proposals on raising awareness to help prevent misconduct, and 
seemed to consider in turn that there was little more that the ICO could be expected to do. 
Sir Christopher encouraged the ICO “to engage directly with the industry” and Tim Toulmin 
stressed the need for the PCC to act ‘with the consent from industry’ in the matter of issuing 
guidance, and also recommended direct engagement with the industry. 

3.30  A number of action points were recorded for the meeting. These were:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

the Code of Practice Committee of Editors was to be engaged by the ICO and the PCC to 
discuss the possibility of changes to the Code and production of guidance;
the PCC was to give thought to the production of question and answer style guidance 
separate of the Code;
the  PCC  was  to  continue  to  condemn  the  illegal  obtaining  of  confidential  personal 
information by journalists; and

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH(d) 

the PCC was to provide the ICO with a formal response to the recommendations in the 
report.

3.31  The disappointment felt by Mr Thomas with the response of the PCC remains keenly felt in 

his oral testimony.85 He was exasperated with the PCC’s line:86 

“[…]Coming back all the time: “What do you want us to do? Tell us exactly what to 
do.” My line was: “Well, you are the self-regulators. You’re the ones supposed to be 
working out what is needed to stop the press getting into unacceptable territory. It’s 
not my job to tell you what your job is.”

3.32  Sir Christopher’s account of this meeting also evinced a certain amount of exasperation also:87 

“I was sort of repeating the same message like a parrot: where’s the beef? For Pete’s 
sake – you know, we can do general exhortation, we can do guidance, we can do this 
stuff, but if you really want me to home in on miscreants, I must have some evidence 
of  who  has  been  procuring  enquiry  agents  –  or  hiring  enquiry  agents  to  procure 
information illegally, and he was unwilling to do that.”

Asked  what  he  might  have  meant  by  saying  that  the  PCC  was  unable  to  act  as  a  general 
regulator, Sir Christopher said this:88

“I think what I had in mind there was a notion that we should in some way take on 
the  work  of  the  Information  Commissioner  by  virtue  of  being  a  Press  Complaints 
Commission, and this is what I wanted to reject. The point I always made to Mr Thomas, 
apart from my insistent demands on beef, was to suggest that we had to work in a 
complementary way. He did his thing, but there were things that we could do to help 
him, and I’ve described them...”

3.33 

It is not the function of this part of the Report to analyse the response of the PCC on its 
own account;89 rightly or wrongly, however, the PCC had unmistakably demonstrated that 
it was unwilling or unable to take action of a sort which could or should have convinced the 
ICO that the problems with the culture, practices and ethics of the press evidenced in the 
Motorman material had been definitively addressed by the industry for the future. It had also 
demonstrated a challenge back to the ICO to address the situation through the discharge of 
its own powers and functions, and specifically by direct engagement with the industry. 

3.34  The  result  is  that  it  was  evident  that  the  strategy  adopted  by  Mr  Thomas  (dialogue  with 
the PCC, and distance from both from the operational choices of his office and from direct 
engagement with the regulated members of the industry) was becoming increasingly unlikely 
to achieve its aims. Whether Mr Thomas considered himself to be dealing with an ineffective 
industry regulator, or with a recalcitrant representative body of the industry itself, the onus 
was clearly firmly on the ICO to reflect further on the direction that it wished to take with the 
Motorman evidence. No such reconsideration appears to have taken place. Nor is it clear that 
the ICO explained to the PCC either its position or its operational approach.

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH3.35  Doubtless in the hope of making progress, in accordance with the action points from the 
meeting,  Mr  Thomas  wrote  to  the  Code  Committee  on  19  July  2006  and  a  meeting  was 
fixed for 21 September. In the meantime, there was a ‘formal response’ from the PCC to the 
effect that the ICO should take up the question of Code amendment directly with the Code 
Committee and that the PCC would await the outcome of that process before turning its mind 
back to the issue of guidance90. Mr Thomas later described himself as having been “fobbed 
off” to the Code Committee by Sir Christopher.91 

3.36  Notably, the question of a response by the PCC was now ‘complicated’ by the fact that the 
then Department for Constitutional Affairs, had issued a consultation paper (picking up from 
What Price Privacy?) relating to the introduction of custodial penalties for conviction under 
s55 of the DPA. In other words, at this point, if not earlier, the strategy around the approach 
to the PCC became inextricably entwined with the political campaign which was the second 
limb of the ICO response to the Motorman material. In relation to this campaign, the PCC 
unambiguously positioned itself not as a regulator of the industry but as a champion of the 
view opposing any legislative change: it did so by active political lobbying (not least through 
Guy Black). The twin tracks of Mr Thomas’s approach effectively became one. It is to the 
political campaign that it is now appropriate to turn.

4.  What Price Privacy?	The	political	campaign
4.1 

Any new statutory regime can take time to bed down in practice and a regulator created by 
statute will be in the best position to report on its practical operation. In relation to the DPA, 
the ICO had two channels for doing so. The first was to do so informally to the sponsoring 
government  department  with  policy  responsibility,92  the  second  was  to  do  so  formally  by 
reporting directly to Parliament either generally on the exercise of its functions under the Act 
or on specific aspects of those functions.93 It was this second channel which had been used in 
the case of the What Price Privacy? Reports.

4.2 

4.3 

Reporting on effectiveness of legislation is not the same as campaigning to change it. The 
duties of the ICO under the DPA focus on performance of statutory functions94 and do not 
themselves  very  obviously  provide  the  platform  from  which  to  mount  such  a  campaign. 
Clearly, the general desirability of a statutory regulator undertaking such a role is a matter of 
judgment on which I do not express an opinion but a number of issues do fall to be considered. 

The  first  is  the  risk  that  a  political  campaign  might  impact  on  the  principal  function  of  a 
regulator such as the ICO, that is to say, the discharge of regulatory obligations which must 
be undertaken independently, impartially, fairly and objectively, and many of them in a quasi-
judicial fashion. As a matter of law, therefore, any campaign should raise no issue, whether as 
a matter of fact or of perception, which could cast any doubt on the proper conduct of those 
functions. In that regard, it is relevant that the ICO exercises regulatory functions in relation 
to the Government itself both as users of personal information and therefore subject to the 
ordinary data protection regime but also of course as the single largest collective subject of 
the freedom of information regime. The Information Commissioner would obviously have 
to be circumspect in relation to any campaign for change in data protection law and, when

personally identifying himself with it, have regard to its effects on the reputation of the office 
and the enhancement of its role and functions.

The  second  issue  relates  to  the  choice  of  the  topic  on  which  to  campaign.  S55  creates  a 
criminal offence with statutory defences and a maximum sentence on conviction of a fine.95 
Yet Mr Thomas had said that the ICO was not principally a prosecuting authority. In most 
regulatory regimes, criminal provisions usually constitute a measure of last resort, dealing 
with situations either of egregious breach for which no other response is appropriate, or for 
persistent and escalating breach where other, stepped, interventions have been tried without 
success. Criminal prosecution is complex and expensive. The deterrent effect of differential 
maximum sentences is not straightforward (and, as discussed below, of potential relevance 
at all only if there is a realistic prospect of apprehension and conviction).

The importance of s55 to the data protection regime did not therefore lie in its centrality to 
the operation of the regime, any functional dependence on it of other powers, the regularity 
with which it was likely to be deployed or its operational visibility to the senior leadership of 
the office. Nor, of course, is s55 a provision of inherent particular relevance to the press: it is 
a provision of complete generality, the offence able to be committed by ‘any person’, whether 
or not they are formally subject themselves to regulation by any of the other provisions of the 
data protection regime. 

In his first witness statement, Mr Thomas suggested that s55 was likely to be the most relevant 
provision of the Act to the Inquiry’s terms of reference.96 Doubtless, he did so because of the 
prominence that he had given the issue in his strategic response to the Motorman evidence 
and the role of the press. It was on 15 April 2005, with the conviction and conditional discharge 
of Mr Whittamore for s55 offences arising out of Motorman, that Mr Thomas records, “When 
I heard this, I can recall personally and strongly sharing my team’s feelings of frustration.”97 
He understood Counsel to have advised as a result that further prosecutions would not be in 
the public interest. “It was then my personal decision to commission a report to be presented 
to Parliament…”

It will be necessary to consider the sentencing remarks of the judge and the reasons for the 
sentencing decision but they are, obviously, fact-specific, not least in relation to the personal 
circumstances  of  Mr  Whittamore  and  his  inability  to  meet  the  obligations  of  a  financial 
penalty. The disappointment in the office at the Whittamore result is understandable, but 
consideration  must  also  be  given  to  the  extent  to  which  the  disappointment  was,  in  any 
event, the direct result of the choices that had been made within the ICO about the extent of 
its own engagement with the criminal process, and about pursuing alternative or additional 
operational options more generally.

The outcome of the prosecution may have been a blow to the ICO principally because, in the 
first place, it had represented the majority of its investment in an operational response to the 
Motorman material. It is beyond question, however, that there was an entirely justifiable and 
genuine sense that it would have been a travesty for matters to have been left there, given 
the sheer extent of the evidence uncovered. It is not entirely clear why the approach adopted 
was seen as the principal way forward.

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH4.9  What  Price  Privacy?  The  unlawful  trade  in  confidential  information98  was  the  report  to 
Parliament  on  the  Motorman  affair  and  its  implications  by  the  ICO  issued  pursuant  to  its 
powers under s52(2) of the Act.99 The foreword provided by Mr Thomas introduced the report 
as being essentially about the evidence of a “pervasive and widespread ‘industry’ devoted to 
the illegal buying and selling” of information contrary to s55, and about the need for change 
to the law. He put it this way:100

“The  crime  at  present  carries  no  custodial  sentence.  When  cases  involving  the 
unlawful procurement or sale of confidential personal information come before the 
courts, convictions often bring no more than a derisory fine or a conditional discharge. 
Low penalties devalue the data protection offence in the public mind and mask the 
true seriousness of the crime, even within the judicial system. They likewise do little 
to deter those who seek to buy or supply confidential information that should rightly 
remain private. The remedy I am proposing is to introduce a custodial sentence of up 
to two years for persons convicted on indictment, and up to six months for summary 
convictions. The aim is not to send more people to prison but to discourage all who 
might be tempted to engage in this unlawful trade.”

Operation Motorman is cited as one of the major cases providing evidence for this trade, but 
a range of other cases are cited also.

4.10  What is striking about this analysis, and indeed about What Price Privacy? more generally, 
is  the  absence  of  any  context  within  which  s55  sits  in  the  wider  data  protection  regime. 
Even  ignoring  the  unexamined  assumption  that  different  sentence  maxima  would  have  a 
definitive impact on the problem, no attention is given to the obvious question of what other 
operational means were available to the ICO to address the problem it had diagnosed. On the 
contrary, the entire thrust of the report is directed to legislative change on criminal penalties. 
As the foreword concludes:101

“These  concerns,  and  the  need  for  increased  penalties,  have  been  raised  with  the 
Department for Constitutional Affairs. The positive response that I have received so far 
is encouraging. These are early and welcome indications of progress on the possibility 
of Government action.”

What Price Privacy? set out the problem. Government action (and of course action by the 
PCC) was expressed to be the answer to the problem. To focus continued attention on the 
issue, the ICO was to publish a follow up report after six months to monitor progress on the 
answer.

4.11  Putting to one side the important argument that breach of the criminal law should not simply 
be seen as a cost of doing business, the most important deterrent the criminal justice system 
can  provide  is  the  likelihood  of  being  caught.  In  the  analysis  of  the  perspective  provided 
by the criminal law,102 the first problem in relation to data protection is that those whose 
personal information is being illegally traded are unlikely to know about it with the result that 
no complaint will ever be made. Thus, the critical aspect of Operation Motorman was the 
unexpected discovery of the ‘treasure trove’ (as was equally the case in relation to Operation

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHCaryatid).103  This  is  particularly  so  in  relation  to  cases  involving  the  press  because  of  the 
complications that will flow from the legal protection afforded to journalistic materials and to 
sources. In truth, without victim complaints, the only systemic way of identifying criminality 
of  this  sort  is  by  the  exercise  of  regulatory  investigative  powers.  If  there  is  a  measure  of 
confidence that crime will not be detected, the possibility of a custodial sentence may not 
be sufficient to discourage the behaviour: it was not sufficient, for example, to prevent the 
phone hacking exposed by Operation Caryatid.

4.12  Mr Thomas explained the objective behind his focus on increasing the maximum available 

sentence for s55 in this way:104

“I think I had quite a long list of objectives by the end of the day, by the time we got to 
publishing this report. The first objective was to tell the world what was going on. The 
primary stated objective was to get the recommendations taken seriously, particularly 
to get the government to increase the penalty, because we felt the penalty was the 
main problem. But I also felt – and I’m not sure this was articulated, but in my own 
mind  –  the  more  noise  we  could  make  about  this,  even  if  not  successful  in  getting 
the law changed, the more that was likely to have a beneficial result. I wanted to get 
people on the back foot.” 

4.13 

Although the significance of a maximum which was financial (so that any penalty would have 
to be linked to means to pay) is important, it is difficult to see it as the ‘main problem’ facing 
a regulator armed with other means of enforcing the law and driving up standards. It had, 
however, attained a more symbolic quality. 

It is possible to sympathise with the description of the problem in the introduction to What 
Price Privacy? that low penalties devalued the data protection offence in the public mind 
and masked the true seriousness of the crime, but it is possible to argue about the degree to 
which the sentence maxima stood proxy for the regime as a whole. In the perennial struggle 
to get data protection (and, thus, the ICO) taken seriously, whether by regulated business, by 
the public, by the courts, by politicians, or by the press, the ICO quite understandably needed 
to make a public example of the Motorman find. The outcome of the Whittamore prosecution 
could be thought to reveal that the wider objective had been set back and that failure was in 
turn symptomatic of the lack of seriousness with which the courts seemed to consider data 
protection. The sentence maxima contributed to that lack of seriousness, and were in turn a 
sign of a lack of legislative seriousness: a failure at the political level to take data protection 
seriously. The s55 campaign was to that extent a test of political commitment, and as such 
existential for the ICO. The Motorman evidence, and the other evidence referred to in What 
Price Privacy?,  gave the  ICO  an  impressive platform  from  which  to  make its  case for  data 
protection.

4.14  Mr Thomas put it this way:105

“The ICO put heavy effort into promoting the two reports. The main aim was to secure 
implementation of our recommendations – especially custodial sentences which were 
primarily seen in terms of deterrence – but also to raise awareness about the nature 

103  Had either Mr Whittamore (in relation to Operation Motorman) or Mr Mulcaire (in relation to Operation Caryatid) 
not retained the records that were seized, none of the material which has proved so important in these investigations 
would ever have been seen

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanHand scale of the illegal trade and get it taken much more seriously. The technique of 
announcing the intention to produce a second (progress) report was deliberately part 
of this strategy.
I was personally involved in this promotional activity to a very considerable extent. The 
Commissioner - as the personification and leader of the ICO - is obviously expected to 
be a visible part of all major activity. In this case, I attached particular priority to the 
issue and also viewed promoting the reports as a tangible way of fulfilling a wider 
ambition to get data protection taken more seriously.”

4.15  Operation Motorman triggered the political campaign on s55 although that campaign was 
neither a specific response to the evidence uncovered by Motorman, nor was it addressed 
specifically to the culture, practices and ethics of the press. At its heart, although it was much 
more general and, in the mind of Mr Thomas, symbolic of the struggle to get data protection 
taken seriously by a wider political audience, it very quickly acquired totemic resonances of a 
very different kind in the political arena into which What Price Privacy? had ventured.

4.16 

It is important to appreciate that the ICO campaign on s55 was not targeted specifically at 
journalists although the campaign against it was championed by the press.106 The publication 
of What Price Privacy? marked the emergence into the public arena of what had until then 
been  low-key  policy  discussions  with  the  Department  for  Constitutional  Affairs  about  law 
reform. It also coincided with a point in the protracted and frustrating dialogue between Mr 
Thomas and the PCC at which the latter had formed a view that there was little it was able or 
willing to contribute to the nominally jointly-espoused aim of effecting culture change in the 
press, without direct regulatory engagement by the ICO with the industry. 

4.17  The arrival of What Price Privacy? proclaimed the introduction of custodial penalties as ‘the 
solution’ to the problem the ICO had been describing to the PCC. This could reasonably have 
been  expected  to  have  been  interpreted  by  the  industry  as  ‘the  solution’  directed  to  the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press in relation to the acquisition and use of personal 
information. It was a solution the press entirely rejected for itself. Two results predictably 
followed. The first was the mobilisation of a political lobbying effort by the press against the 
campaign, directed to the heart of government. The second was a hardening of the attitude 
of the press (now unmistakably represented by the PCC) towards the ICO.

4.18  As Mr Thomas described, his political campaign was both elaborate and extensive; on any basis, 
it was a major undertaking and a substantial investment of his personal time and attention. 
In  the  end  it  involved  him  engaging  at  the  highest  levels  in  Government  and  extensively 
in Parliament, including by giving evidence to no fewer than four Select Committees.107 By 
December 2006 (the time of the promised follow-up report What Price Privacy Now? The 
first six months progress in halting the unlawful trade in confidential personal information),108 
the campaign had, at least in its own terms, achieved a measure of success. On 24 July 2006, 
the DCA had published its public consultation paper on increasing the sentencing maxima for 
s55 to include custodial penalties.109 There had been a degree of public attention and media 
coverage (What Price Privacy Now? had included four pages of headline press cuttings) and

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHthe  report  claimed  an  encouraging  response  from  the  investigations  industry,  and  raised 
awareness among (at any rate intermediary) media organisations. 

4.19  The follow-up report expressed disappointment with the opposition from within the press 
(both  by  editors  and  proprietors)  to  the  s55  campaign  and  considered  it  misconceived  in 
underestimating the existing protections in the law and the commitment of the ICO itself to 
freedom of expression. Its conclusion was that:110

“There  is  still  further  work  to  be  done  to  reduce  the  demand  for  illegally  obtained 
confidential information. This work will be ongoing. We will continue to track down 
and prosecute offenders. We will continue to press the Government to introduce the 
option of a prison sentence and see this progress report as supporting that goal. We 
will continue to raise awareness and we will encourage and work with any organisation 
that wants to raise standards or produce clear guidance on data protection obligations. 
In particular we will be working closely with the media on the development of relevant 
guidance and standards for journalists.”

editors
At this point it is appropriate to return to the dialogue between Mr Thomas and the PCC 
whose ‘formal response’ had been to direct the ICO to the Editors’ Code Committee while 
noting that the issue had become ‘complicated’ by the publication of the DCA consultation 
on s55. 

On 21 September 2006, Mr Thomas met Ian Beales, Secretary of the Editors’ Code of Practice 
Committee.  Mr  Thomas  described  the  meeting  in  his  internal  note  as  ‘interesting  and 
intelligent’. 111 In addition to the established themes of louder condemnation of unacceptable 
practices and suitable amendments to the Code, Mr Thomas was explicitly now also looking 
for ‘better awareness of s55’ from the industry. S55 was evidently the dominant theme in the 
event, Mr Thomas with a degree of understatement indicating that “support for the prison 
sentence would be welcome, but I did not expect that” and Mr Beales dismissive of the DCA 
paper  and  stressing  the  ‘chilling  effect’  of  the  proposal.  Mr  Thomas  had  proffered  some 
proposed Code changes of his own but came away from the meeting largely empty handed. 

On Mr Thomas’s account, Mr Beales’s position was simple: “his main difficulty is that there is 
not much incentive to improve the Code unless the threat of increased penalties disappears at 
the same time”. If accurately represented, this is a somewhat remarkable position to adopt: 
the offence contained within s55 was the law and contained within it a defence for journalists 
acting in the public interest. A Code of Conduct should surely provide the very best guidance 
it can and it is difficult to see why there needs to be an incentive to improve it. 

In any event, the press had fully subsumed the dialogue between the ICO and the PCC into 
its own political campaign in opposition to reform of s55 and it may be legitimate to infer the 
extent to which Mr Thomas had accepted that reconstitution of the agenda: his note suggests 
that the talk of producing joint guidance was now explicitly in terms of ‘better section 55 
guidance’ rather than anything more generally addressed to the culture, practices and ethics 
of the press in the handling of personal information.

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH5.5 

On  27  October  2006,  there  was  a  follow-up  meeting  (at  NI’s  Wapping  premises):  the 
Committee Chairman Les Hinton, and Stephen Abell from the PCC also attended. The note of 
that meeting suggests that Mr Hinton made plain from the outset that the Code Committee 
had no mandate to take a position at that point but was considering its response to What 
Price Privacy?.112 The conversation appears to have amounted to a further turn around the 
familiar  course  but  with  Mr  Thomas  now  leading  on  s55.  Dealing  with  the  ‘illegal  trade’ 
needed tougher sentences, but these were not targeted at journalists (who in any event had 
the protection of special exemptions), he was seeking co-operation with guidance and code 
revisions as a means of addressing journalism’s contribution to the demand side of that illegal 
trade. Mr Thomas had evidently responded to the industry’s elision of the PCC dialogue and 
the s55 campaign, not by attempting to return the dialogue to its original broader purpose 
but by accepting the redrawn terms of reference and trying to argue his side of that debate.

5.6  Mr Hinton’s response, however, is illuminative of the distance this dialogue had shifted from 
the original sceptical but pragmatic tone of the PCC in the opening stages of the encounter. 
Not only did he deploy the familiar challenge back to the ICO on the question of regulatory 
inaction,  and  the  clear  statement  of  objection  to  the  s55  campaign,  cast  in  the  language 
of the chilling effect on journalism, but he moved the counter-attack on to the territory of 
the principles of press self-regulation. Mr Thomas records the Committee representatives as 
having:113

“expressed the view that a prison sentence would undermine the effective operation 
of the PCC as legal advice is likely to result in journalists not cooperating with PCC 
investigations  in  case  they  incriminate  themselves.  In  addition  explicit  inclusion  of 
offences in the code would need to be investigated by the prosecuting authority not 
the PCC effectively taking that provision outside of and therefore undermining the self 
regulatory model.”

This ignores the fact that the criminal offence existed and was hardly the constructive dialogue 
of fellow regulators; this was taking the political battle on to definitive territory with an open 
challenge to the ICO to retreat from PCC (that is to say industry) territory.

5.7 

5.8 

In a contemporaneous handwritten note by Mr Thomas,114 the words ‘last chance saloon’ 
appear.  At  one  stage  earlier  in  the  dialogue,  Mr  Thomas  appears  to  have  deployed  an 
intimation  that  the  credibility  of  the  PCC  as  a  ‘self-regulator’  was  at  stake  in  response  to 
the action he sought from them in the aftermath of Motorman. If he was seeking to deploy 
it again in the highly-charged context of the s55 debate that was undoubtedly a high-risk 
political  strategy,  and  Mr  Hinton’s  response  would  be  to  a  degree  less  startling.  Needless 
to  say,  Mr  Thomas  emerged  from  that  meeting  empty  handed  again.  Mr  Hinton’s  follow-
up letter of 17 November was more positive in tone, but non-committal as regards further 
industry action.115

It was now fully three years since Mr Thomas had moved to open a dialogue with the PCC, 
during  which  period  he  had  identified  himself  very  personally  with  the  conduct  of  that 
relationship. The return on that significant personal investment was not evident. But even 
now, at a point which might be described as open antagonism, there was no evidence that he 
sought to reappraise his approach. It is possible that one effect of the elision of the PCC and 
s55 strands of his strategy had been to reframe the former not as a practical end in itself but,

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHby keeping open a channel of communication, as a means of furthering (or at least seeking to 
manage opposition to) the latter. At any rate, Mr Thomas persisted in it.

5.9  What Price Privacy Now? provided some public comment on the interaction between the 
ICO and the PCC, thereby to some extent setting the agenda for its future interaction. It also 
records an understanding that the PCC ‘monitors and adjudicates on disputes about breaches 
of the Editors’ Code of Practice, which sets out the conduct the press have agreed to follow 
as part of a self regulatory system’.116 The progress recorded was, however, relatively modest 
and is in these terms:

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

The PCC had confirmed publicly and in writing that journalists must act within the law.
It had agreed to keep repeating that message – and the ICO “hopes that this will be 
done as loudly and actively as possible”.
There  had  been  discussion  about  Code  amendment  relating  to  the  acquisition  of 
personal  information  –  “unfortunately,  however,  no  concrete  proposals  have  so  far 
been brought forward”.
The  Code  Committee  had  rejected  the  ICO’s  own  suggested  amendments,  but  had 
agreed to keep the matter under review.
There was agreement in principle to the issue of “guidance for journalists” by the PCC 
with ICO assistance.

5.10  On  4  January  2007,  there  was  a  further  meeting  with  Murdoch  MacLennan  (then  Chief 
Executive Officer of Telegraph Media Group) and Guy Black, both by this stage leading actors 
in the s55 counter-campaign. On Mr Thomas’ account,117 the agreed action points were that 
the ICO should prepare guidance on s55 and the public interest defence with a view to helping 
journalists to navigate it. It is notable, first, that the focus appears to have swung fully around 
from the industry representatives being asked to take action to change the culture, practices 
and ethics of the press, to the regulator being asked to clarify the law and his approach to 
regulation. Secondly, this appears, in itself, to have become part of what was, by now, a three-
way negotiation on s55 between the press, the government and Mr Thomas. 

5.11  The  course  of  that  negotiation  is  set  out  more  fully  in  that  part  of  the  Report  that  deals 
with the relationship  between the press and politicians.118 It culminated in a compromise 
arrangement  whereby  a  custodial  penalty  for  s55  was  finally  introduced  by  the  Criminal 
Justice and Immigration Act 2008,119 together with an enhanced, more subjective defence for 
journalists, but neither provision was commenced as operative law; commencement relies 
on  the  exercise  of  an  Order-making  power  which  has  not  to  date  been  exercised.  At  the 
same time, further desultory exchanges were continuing between Mr Thomas and the PCC. 
By letter of 27 March 2007, the Code Committee eventually rejected the amendments to 
the Code that he had proposed, but suggested some alternatives.120 The ICO responded on  
16 April, accepting the changes on the basis of a 

“hope that they will be introduced with maximum publicity and advice to the media. 
Otherwise, the ‘burial’ of the changes within the existing Code, and the absence of a 
section explicitly prohibiting the obtaining of any private information without consent 
or a public interest justification, may present the risk that unacceptable activity will 
continue.”

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanHThere is no indication that the ICO saw itself as playing a direct role in publicity and advice to 
the media. The letter reaffirmed the ICO’s commitment to the s55 campaign and to producing 
guidance on s55 for journalists.121

5.12  On 25 April 2007, there was a further meeting with Guy Black and colleagues from press 
representative  bodies  to  discuss  ‘stakeholder  engagement’  and  the  preparation  of  the 
guidance. It seems to have been inconclusive. The press representatives saw their role in 
relation to the guidance as ‘supporting and commenting and they do not envisage a jointly 
badged  product’;  the  ICO  undertook  to  shorten  and  simplify  the  latest  draft  of  the  s.55 
guidance.122 A new version was worked on over the late spring and summer of 2007. Work 
also began within the ICO on a draft statement of prosecution policy on s55, designed to 
provide a measure of reassurance to the press as the ICO continued its campaign for custodial 
penalties over the first half of 2008.

5.13  An insight into the extent to which Mr Thomas had become very personally engaged in the 
politics  of  the  passage  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Criminal  Justice  and  Immigration 
Bill  can  be  gained  from  some  of  the  contemporary  documentation  which  he  provided  to 
the  Inquiry.  In  February  2008,  the  ICO  prepared  a  draft  report  to  Parliament  in  response 
to  its  apprehension  that  the  amendment  would  be  withdrawn  by  the  Government  in  the 
face of press-sponsored opposition123 as well as briefing for Ministers and recommendations 
for Parliamentary handling.124 It also shows Mr Thomas directly lobbying the Government 
against withdrawal of the amendment in terms which included:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 
(d) 
(e) 

(f) 

urging that ‘withdrawal would damage the reinvigorated credibility and authority of 
data protection law and the Information Commissioner’s Office’;
an intimation that withdrawal would ‘sit strangely’ with the Government’s legislation 
on identity cards;
the anticipation of support in a number of outstanding Select Committee Reports;
ripostes to the press campaigning;
averring a determination on his own part to stop the pernicious, largely hidden and 
illegal market in personal data; and
a conclusion, ‘with considerable reluctance’ that he would respond to withdrawal by 
laying a further specific report before Parliament.125

In  due  course,  Mr  Thomas  met  the  Prime  Minister,  preparing  for  an  agreed  role  in  the 
continuing political negotiations between the Government and the press. He said that ‘the 
PM started by saying that I had the most difficult job in the country’.126 

5.14 

It is noteworthy that Mr Thomas was placing no (other) operational action by the ICO into 
this political arena. There was no proffered action plan for the means by which the ICO would 
structure  its  priorities  and  operations  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  legislative  change  would, 
indeed, stop the trafficking of confidential personal information. The assumption appeared 
to remain that the change in its own right, and the accompanying publicity for the role of 
the ICO in promoting that change, would be effective in themselves. An internal note of a

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHmeeting that Mr Thomas had with senior officials from the Ministry of Justice (the successor 
department to the DCA) is illustrative of the way he was thinking.127 As well as offering an 
assessment of the party politics of the Bill’s provisions, he described his likely public reaction 
to a then-current possibility to change its provisions significantly in favour of the press. It 
would, he said, be “nuclear”:

“I  said  it  would  be  very  noisy  and  very  messy.  We  will  publicly  denounce  any  such 
attempt. If we lost, we would publish a third report to Parliament, documenting how 
this state of affairs had come about.”

5.15  Suggestions that the press might finally take steps of their own (such as amendment to the 
Code, training and guidance) to address the extent to which their own culture, practices and 
ethics were in issue were now dismissed as ‘too little, too late’. Only a change in the law would 
do. To that end, Mr Thomas wrote to selected high profile opposition politicians (including 
the Conservative and Liberal Democrat leaders) as ‘a warning shot across the bows of those 
who might be wavering and as an encouragement to potential supporters’ and planned press 
releases and a public media initiative. 

5.16  This was not a regulator simply enhancing public debate from an expert point of view. Mr 
Thomas himself described it as ‘playing hard ball’128 or, in other words, full-blooded political 
campaigning. As noted above, the issue was settled for the time being by the compromise 
solution of legislation for custodial penalties (along with an improved defence) which was not 
then and has not since been commenced. At the same time, correspondence continued with 
industry representatives over the summer of 2008 about the publication of guidance and the 
promotion of awareness.

5.17  About the compromise solution on s55, Mr Thomas himself said this:129

“This  was  clearly  the  end  of  this  particular  road.  I  saw  the  compromise  in  “half  a 
loaf” terms and – although very disappointed – recognised that it would still serve 
some deterrent and awareness-raising purpose, though less direct or powerful than 
originally envisaged.” 

5.18  Reflecting more generally on his interaction with the PCC, Mr Thomas referred many times 
to an overall sense of disappointment. This is important commentary and it is worth setting 
some of them out in full. 

(a) “I  think  over  time  I  was  somewhat  disappointed.  Although  I  don’t  decry 

everything they did, it fell short of what I’d hoped they might be doing.”130

(b) “The evidence shows that I went back a number of times to the PCC throughout 
2005, 2006 and 2007, and tried to keep – engage their interest with it. But it 
is true to say that I thought their response was less strident and I think I used 
the word “disappointing” more than once in this context. I thought they could 
and should have done more.”131

Chapter 2 | Operation MotormanH(c)  “We  thought  and  had  some  hopes  that  the  PCC  would  be  a  better  way  of 
addressing the problem than anything to do with [pur]suing the prosecutions, 
which we were, at that time, recognising was going to be very expensive and 
demanding for the office. Now, with hindsight, I think I would have been more 
aggressive and more assertive with the PCC and with the Code at the outset, 
and they did disappoint me, as I said, in terms of their response.”132 

(d) “Overall – with only the limited progress recorded on page 19 of What Price 
Privacy  Now?  –  I  was  disappointed  by  the  response  from  the  PCC  and  the 
Editors’ Code of Practice Committee before and during 2006. I had hoped for 
much stronger and louder condemnation of wholly unacceptable misconduct, 
an explicit change to the Code, and more focussed guidance. Instead, there 
seemed to be a “Catch-22” view that the conduct was already illegal and that 
therefore not much – if anything – could be done by way of self-regulation. 
The  exchanges  did  lead  to  guidance  (with  which  the  ICO  assisted)  on  data 
protection law at large and some discussion about possible changes to the 
Code, but this increasingly seemed directed as much as heading off tougher 
sentences.”133

5.19  Notwithstanding all of this, Mr Thomas made clear his view that his strategy (that is to say, the 
continuing dialogue with the PCC, publication of his two reports to Parliament, and getting 
the law changed, despite the non-commencement of the changes) had proved to be very 
effective, at any rate in relation to the press.134 His grounds for saying so come down to what 
he claimed was the lack of evidence of criminal conduct within the press postdating 2006:135

“I am not saying it’s been eliminated altogether – this is under the surface, clearly – 
but I am saying – and my successor has said this to Parliament very recently, in October 
of this year [2011] – that it appears that the press are now behaving themselves in this 
particular area.”

5.20  Such  empirical  evidence  as  Mr  Thomas  offers  for  this  conclusion  appears  to  amount  to 
accepting the word of the industry.136 Without asserting the contrary, absence of evidence 
that undermines that assertion is not the same as saying that there is evidence that it is so. In 
the circumstances, it is necessary to consider the claims made by Mr Thomas for his strategy 
in general and to examine the paths that the ICO chose not to follow in parallel and, from 
there, to review whether, in more recent times, the press has, in fact, ceased to be any real 
source of interest to the ICO.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHChapter 3 
Other pOssible regulat Ory OptiOns

1.  Criminal proceedings in respect of journalists
1.1 

No journalist was ever subject to prosecution as a result of Operation Motorman. Indeed, 
the ICO never got as far even as interviewing any journalist in connection with examining the 
possibility of criminal proceedings (however limited the value of doing so might have been). 
There is considerable dispute as to why that happened.

1.2 

The account provided by Alex Owens is that, within weeks of the commencement of work on 
the electronic discs of the Motorman material, they were:1

“informed that we were not to make contact with any of the newspapers identified 
and we were not to speak to, let alone, interview any journalists. Despite our protests 
we were told this was the decision of Richard Thomas and that he would deal with the 
press involvement by way of the Press Complaints Council. It was at this moment we 
knew no journalist could or ever would be prosecuted in relation to our investigation. 
No journalist or Newspaper Group was ever spoken to by anyone from the Information 
Commissioner’s Investigations Unit in relation to Operation Motorman. We also now 
knew  that  one  of  the  major  questions  that  needed  to  be  asked  but  could  never  be 
asked, let alone answered was ’Why did you want all these ex-directory / mobile / 
family and friend telephone numbers and most importantly what were you doing with 
them?’”

He  was,  he  said,  given  to  understand  that  the  focus  of  continuing  criminal  investigation 
was to be exclusively on the private investigators, the blaggers and the corrupt officials and 
employees:2 

“Basically they’d drawn a red line, with the press and the reporters above that line and 
we dealt with anything below that line.” 

1.3 

He described the way in which the team continued to prepare papers for conspiracy charges in 
respect of the remaining defendants (specimen charges relating to breach of s55 of the Act), 
interviewed some 50 to 60 victims and (under caution) all persons suspected of the unlawful 
obtaining, disclosing or blagging on behalf of Mr Whittamore. This material was passed to 
the  ICO  legal  department  for  action  and,  by  February  2004, the  work  was  completed.  He 
described  having  attended  a  conference  with  external  counsel,  in  October  2003,  in  order 
to  consider  the  weight  of  the  evidence,  and  the  written  advice  received  that  December 
which supported taking forward the conspiracy charges. counsel also directly addressed the 
question of criminal proceedings against journalists, advising:3

“Having regard to the sustained and serious nature of the journalistic involvement in 
the overall picture, there can be little doubt that many, perhaps all, of the journalists 
involved have committed offences.

H“The inference, overwhelming, it seems to me, is that several editors must have been 
well aware of what their staff were up to and therefore party to it. I understand that 
policy considerations have led to the view that enforcement of some sort rather than 
prosecution is the way forward in respect of the journalists/newspapers.
“I understand and sympathise with that approach. This is, I believe, the first occasion 
upon which the scale of the problem has come to light and it may not be unreasonable 
to give the Press Complaints Commission the chance to put their house in order.” 

1.4 

On  the  basis  of  that  policy,  counsel  considered  whether  journalists  or  editors  should  be 
cautioned  in  the  light  of  the  evidence  of  the  extent  of  their  involvement  and  the  ‘often 
unpleasant’ nature of the offending. He also registered a measure of anxiety about taking 
forward the conspiracy charges to the exclusion of press defendants:4

“Those defending in the prosecution might seek to make capital from the fact that 
the journalists are not being prosecuted. The judge might also comment on the basis 
that the journalists are the ones (it seems) who created the demand for this offending. 
With this in mind, it is a sensible precaution to equip me at some point before trial with 
the detail of the reasoning not to prosecute. I may need to explain or even defend the 
decision to the judge.”

There is no evidence that a detailed statement was in fact produced.

1.5 

After completing work on the files, on Mr Owens’s account:5

“we received no feed back whatsoever as to what action was being taken in relation to 
the press’s involvement. On those occasions we did ask the question the only response 
we received was that ‘Richard [the Commissioner] was dealing with it’.” 

The prosecution was ultimately conducted by the CPS and he describes how the ICO was 
neither formally aware of or involved in the prosecution of Mr Whittamore; the next they 
heard, in April 2005, was that he had been conditionally discharged by the Crown Court at 
Blackfriars. Mr Owens left the ICO at around this time, with, he said, unanswered questions 
about what if any action had been taken in respect of the press, and why such prosecution as 
had proceeded seemed to have involved Mr Whittamore but none of the other conspirators. 
He  concluded  that  ‘something  had  gone  drastically  wrong  with  the  prosecution  case’, 
producing an outcome which did not begin to do justice to the Motorman material. 6

1.6 

On Mr Owens’s account, therefore, the suggestion within the Motorman material of prima 
facie criminality within the press could and should have been taken forward to prosecution. 
He said “we were in a position to prosecute everyone in the chain from the ‘blagger’ right 
up to the journalists and possibly even the newspaper groups”.7 However, he said that the 
intervention  of  a  policy  decision  by  Mr  Thomas  to  proceed  with  the  matter  himself  and 
exclusively in dialogue with the PCC as a result of, or additionally because of, a reluctance to 
engage directly in enforcement action in relation to the press prevented this from happening. 

1.7 

This account was vigorously disputed by both Mr Aldhouse and Mr Thomas. The evidence 
of Mr Aldhouse was that there was no policy, or none that he was aware of, of holding back 
from the prosecution of journalists. He was clear that he was not involved in the operational 
decision-making at all; however, if he had been asked, he would have considered that there

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHwas  indeed  a  case  for  taking  the  involvement  of  journalists  and  newspapers  in  criminal 
behaviour further. Nor would he have thought resourcing problems a conclusive argument 
against doing so: he thought that it would have been possible to have discussed the possibility 
of supplementary funding with the sponsoring government department. But he did not apply 
his mind to such considerations at the time; it was not his place to do so. He was aware of a 
measure of frustration in the investigations team that no action had been taken in relation to 
the press, and of some discussion about the disappointing criminal process in the office, but 
could recall no detail.8

1.8  Mr Thomas also denied any positive policy decision or instruction being given not to proceed 
with  criminal  investigations  into  press  conduct.  This  denial  was  emphatic  and  can  be 
enumerated:

(a) “there was no such policy decision, certainly not at the early stage”;9
(b) “[it]  is  possible  that  Mr  Owens  has  somehow  confused  or  conflated  all  the 
dates  and  interpreted  that  [Mr  Thomas  going  to  the  PCC]  as  some  sort  of 
policy or some sort of instruction, but that was not the case”;10

(c)  “[if] there was a policy, it was not one which I had any hand in, one which I 

knew about, which I made or which I was told about”;11

(d) “as far as I’m aware, there was absolutely no such policy and I can’t think why 

there would have been such a policy”;12

(e) “what I’m trying to say – and I hope I’m coming across very clearly – is that 
there was no policy from the outset that we weren’t going to go against the 
press”;13

(f)  “Q: Your evidence is that the policy steer didn’t come from you?  

A: Absolutely not”;14

(g) “there is clear evidence that there was not a policy conclusion even at that 

point [the approach to the PCC]”;15

(h) “I  don’t  accept  that  there  was  a  policy  decision.  I  don’t  accept  that  we 

abandoned the possibility of prosecuting journalists.”16

1.9 

Indeed, Mr Thomas was insistent in his evidence that there was no ‘conscious decision’ at all 
not to prosecute journalists.17 He explained that in two different ways although, on the face 
of it, these are not entirely straightforward to reconcile. He said both that he assumed that 
in fact the office was making progress with the prosecution of journalists as they would with 
any other criminal investigation,18 and also that there was an active plan to keep the option of 
prosecution alive but to wait and see first how the conspiracy prosecutions being undertaken 
by the CPS fared, and in due course, if all went well, to activate them.19

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsH1.10  Taking the second of these first, the problem with any ‘wait and see’ strategy was articulated 
by  Mr  Owens.  He  described  his  response  to  the  way  in  which  the  discontinuance  of  the 
criminal proceedings for conspiracy was described in What Price Privacy? in the following 
terms:20

“This was a great disappointment to the ICO, especially at it seemed to underplay the 
seriousness of section 55 offences. It also meant that it was not in the public interest 
to proceed with the ICO’s own prosecutions, nor could the Information Commissioner 
contemplate  bringing  prosecutions  against  the  journalists  or  others  to  whom 
confidential information had been supplied.” 

1.11  As Mr Owens explained:21

“It may be correct in relation to the others, you know, the blaggers and the thing, but 
you could never go back after three years and contemplate prosecuting journalists. 
They’d never even been investigated. And I – there’s enough legal people here to know 
if I – I kept evidence – you can’t put – if you have a conspiracy, you can’t put five people 
on the back-burner and wait and see how you got on with the same five people in 
the front that’s getting prosecuted, because you got a good result, right, we’ll go and 
prosecute them as well. Well, they’re all part of one conspiracy. You either investigate 
them  all,  or  those  five  you  have  to  say  we’re  not  going  to  investigate  them  which 
means we’re not going to prosecute them. I don’t know whether that would be - is the 
correct word abuse of the justice system?”

1.12 

In my judgment, as a matter of criminal process, the proposition that the journalists were not 
investigated because there was a deliberate strategy which had been thought through (in the 
light of evidence that was known about and understood) simply to see how the prosecutions 
against the ‘middle men’ went before proceeding against the press is neither credible nor 
sustainable. In any event, there is no contemporaneous evidence that this was indeed the 
strategy. This is very different from a decision not to proceed for good operational reasons, 
followed by a later re-evaluation. 

1.13  The other argument advanced by Mr Thomas was that there was indeed an active policy to 
pursue criminal inquiries into the activities of the press, but that they ran their operational 
course to no effect. He suggested a number of operational reasons for the ICO not, in the end, 
proceeding with criminal proceedings in respect of the press. They included:

(a) 

(b) 

the inevitability that severe and disproportionate logistical difficulties would be faced, 
including the commitment of significant resources;22
legal uncertainty about the difficulty of proving ‘procuring’ of disclosure by the press 
(which  would  require  establishing  knowledge  or  recklessness  about  the  lack  of  the 
individual’s consent) and about the possible  deployment of public  interest defences 
by journalists;23

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

(g) 

an understanding that Mr Owens’s extended sick leave and anxieties about his reliability 
as a witness, influencing legal advice to withdraw from prosecution action;24
a strategic view that it would be preferable to defer conclusively to the CPS prosecution 
of  the corruption  cases, “giving  precedence” to the corruption  proceedings  because 
they were “more serious” and carried higher sentence maxima than the cases which 
the ICO could prosecute;25
a  strategic  preference  for  proceeding  against  the  ‘middle-men’,  at  the  heart  of  the 
organised trade in confidential personal information;26
the  ‘perversity’  of  the  outcome  in  the  Whittamore  prosecution:  the  conditional 
discharge was a reason any further prosecutions would not be in the public interest, 
and  in  particular  “completely  extinguished  any  possibility  whatsoever  of  prosecuting 
journalists”;27 and
a sense that “any formal action, particularly a prosecution, was likely to be, if you like, 
that much more difficult because there will be less sympathy for the celebrity.” This is a 
jury point, perhaps, about the unattractiveness of bringing cases in respect of celebrity 
victims who might, however unfairly, be considered to have compromised their own 
data protection entitlements.28

1.14  The difficulty with any or all of these explanations is that, on Mr Thomas’s own account, the 
Inquiry saw no evidence that at the time the ICO went through a strategic decision-making 
process which actively considered any of these points and reached a conclusion on them. 
There clearly would have been the need for major decisions to have been taken one way or 
the other about the allocation of resources, significant operational planning and close liaison 
with the police and the CPS. There is no evidence that any of this happened. On the contrary, 
the best evidence available to the Inquiry suggests that:

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

there was prima facie evidence of criminal behaviour by journalists;
this was investigated up to a point within the ICO by paper analysis and by interviewing 
a selected group of victims;
external  counsel  encouraged  the  view  that  the  evidence  of  criminal  conduct  by 
journalists was persuasive and that there were merits in taking the matter further; but
the matter was not taken any further by the ICO in relation to data protection offences, 
not even to the stage of approaching a single journalist either to be interviewed or for 
a statement.

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsH1.15  Mr  Thomas  was  either  unaware  that  the  matter  was  not  proceeding  within  his  office,  or 
aware of it without challenging that state of affairs. Either is problematic. The first suggests a 
disconnection from one of the biggest operational cases the ICO ever dealt with to a degree 
which is difficult to understand. After all, this was a case on which he himself spent many 
years pursuing at a strategic and political level. There was this exchange:29 

“Q: When the prosecution started, there were no journalists there. Did you not think 
about that? 
A: I wasn’t involved in these meetings. 
Q:  No  …  not  the  meetings,  but  you  were  alert  as  to  what  was  going  on  with  the 
prosecution process? 
A. Only in very general terms and I have no recollection.” 

At the very least, the second explanation raises questions about the extent of the interest 
that  Mr  Thomas  had  in  this  aspect  of  the  enforcement  of  the  data  protection  regime 
notwithstanding the extent of the abuse revealed by Operation Motorman.

1.16  This important matter was directly put in this way by Robert Jay QC to Mr Thomas when he 

gave evidence:30

“May I try and sum up the position in this way? Given two facts which we know, Mr 
Thomas – the first fact is that the journalists were never interviewed by your office and 
the second fact is that such an interview would be a sine qua non to a prosecution, 
out of fairness to the journalists on the one hand, in order to obtain further evidence - 
does it not follow that either there was a policy decision not to pursue that course or, 
alternatively, there were operational failures or decisions by the investigators not to 
carry out an elementary step, namely to interview?”

1.17  Mr  Thomas  challenged  that  dichotomy,  but  only  by  way  of  suggesting  that  an  alternative 
was the ‘wait and see’ policy which is not, itself, obviously compatible with an omission to 
interview any journalist in a timely fashion. Mr Jay therefore put the analysis to him even 
more directly:31

Q. “So at the moment I am thrashing around mentally to see what other alternative 
there  might  be  beyond  a  policy  decision  on  the  one  hand  or  incompetence  in  your 
investigation officers on the other.” 
A. “Well, if you want to put it in those terms, I have to put it to the latter, but I am 
absolutely – you know, absolutely clear because I wouldn’t have done any of the things 
I had done right through 2005, 2006, 2007 if I had thought at any time that I or anybody 
else had said: ‘Back off the journalists’.” 

1.18  This is an answer which has difficulties at many levels and, in fairness to Mr Thomas, may not 
bear too close an analysis. As between a policy or an operational failure there are perhaps 
levels of intermediate gradation. It is, however, necessary to take stock of the issue of non-
prosecution of journalists by the ICO.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH1.19 

In the first place, it does not seem that there need have been any reason from the outset for 
the ICO not to have proceeded down the path towards active pursuit of prosecution. Mr Jay 
put it this way:32

“But if all one needed to do: “Let’s cherry pick the best cases of illegality. The friends 
and family cases, the one or two police national computer cases. We’ll interview the 
journalists  in  those  cases.  We  might  interview  the  editors.”  That  is  a  fairly  narrow 
exercise. You can then assess how strong the case is. After all, if the evidence is strong 
enough, you might even get guilty pleas. Who knows?”

1.20  A lot of evidence was available, and a good deal of work was done in the early stages. Mr Owens 
took the point that it might not have required a huge amount of delving and interrogation by 
him in relation to the relevant journalists to get the answers he needed to the questions in his 
mind (which principally concerned why they wanted the material). Some might have declined 
to answer; of those who answered, some answers might have incriminated journalists, others 
might have exonerated them.33 But the questions were never asked. It would not have been 
operationally impossible, and ought perhaps to have been operationally rather attractive, to 
have proceeded in the way Mr Jay hypothesised. But there was no indication that this was 
ever contemplated, far less attempted.

1.21 

In  the  second  place,  although  I  recognise  that  the  conditional  discharge  imposed  on  Mr 
Whittamore meant that there was little practical prospect of resuming criminal investigations 
in relation to the press for the reasons outlined above, such an outcome was hardly possible 
to foresee. The record that the ICO made of the hearing before His Honour Judge Samuels QC 
in the Crown Court at Blackfriars in April 2005 (including his sentencing remarks)34 does not 
on the face of it even support the proposition that the prosecution of journalists was out of 
the question following the conditional discharge of Mr Whittamore. 

1.22  From this note, it is possible to derive the following propositions:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

The  sentence  in  this  case  was  clearly  to  a  degree  based  on  the  particular  position 
of  a  co-defendant  (previously  sentenced  in  ignorance  of  this  prosecution)  and  the 
unchallenged  personal  circumstances  of  Mr  Whittamore  who  was  described  as  of 
previous good character; in a state of depression; ‘reclusive’; ‘probably a broken man’ of 
limited means, unemployed and effectively unemployable in his previous line of work.
There were procedural considerations militating strongly in favour of a swift disposal of 
the case.
There  is  no  indication  at  all  that  the  sentencing  judge  considered  the  offending 
behaviour not to be serious in nature; on the contrary, he observed: “The vice of the 
primary conspiracy was to make known to the press information which on any view 
ought to have been confidential … I refer to the vice and I do so again as a warning to 
others; others cannot expect leniency as seen today.”

1.23  To be fair to Mr Thomas and the ICO, it is right to record that there were some issues about 
the nature and extent of the co-operation between the ICO on the one hand and the police 
on the other. Mr Owens said of the prosecution:35

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsH“We  had  never  been  advised  that  the  matter  was  due  before  the  courts.  We  were 
never  given  the  opportunity  to  attend  even  though  we  had  been  the  investigating 
officers and were never given any details of what had happened in relation to all the 
other defendants we had anticipated would be jointly charged with Whittamore for 
conspiracy…  we  did  hear  that  there  had  been  some  conflict  between  the  ICO  legal 
team and the Crown Prosecution Service/Metropolitan Police…”

1.24  Mr Thomas put the matter in this way:36

“I also understand that there was a feeling that the prosecutor had not accurately 
conveyed some of the material to the court vis-a-vis the journalistic aspect, and I can’t 
turn it up straight away now, but some of the notes you’ve had from the ICO’s legal file 
indicated that the barrister for the CPS had not perhaps conveyed the full picture. We’d 
sort of – if you like, were not actively engaged or involved in that.”

1.25 

It  is  neither  possible  nor  necessary  to  reach  any  conclusion  about  the  extent  to  which  a 
failure  of  liaison  impacted  on  this  prosecution,  although  a  close  and  mutually  supportive 
relationship between ICO, police and CPS in this type of case is clearly important. 

1.26  Putting to one side the issues which flow from a consideration of the result of the prosecution, 
and reverting to the initial decisions, the conflict between the investigator, Mr Owens, and 
Mr Thomas remains real. Mr Owens bluntly put the matter in this way:37

“In conclusion I would summarize by saying it is my opinion that:
• 

ICO’s  decision  not  to  investigate  any  journalist  in  relation  to  Operation 
Motorman was a wrong decision.

•  This decision was certainly not based on any advice given by counsel or on any 
lack of evidence, as ICO would have everyone believe. The decision had been 
made long before the involvement of any Counsel or opinions being requested 
and there was overwhelming evidence that many of the journalists did know 
or at least should have known the information they were requesting could only 
be obtained illegally and what they were requesting was not for a purpose 
which would carry any form of ’public interest’ defence.

•  The decision not to pursue any journalist was based solely on fear - fear of 
the power, wealth and influence of the Press and the fear of the backlash that 
could follow if the press turned against ICO.

•  The  publication  in  May  2006  of  ’What  price  privacy’  was  no  more  than  an 
attempt  to  lock  the  stable  door  after  the  horse  had  bolted  in  an  effort  to 
cover up the fact that ICO had failed in its duty to conduct a full and proper 
investigation into the conduct of journalists at the time when they could and 
should have.

“Throughout the whole of the time the Motorman investigation was on going there was 
never any mention or suggestion of any report being commissioned for Parliament. I 
feel it was no coincidence that this report was not published until May 2006, only a few 
weeks before the Mulcaire scandal broke. It is my belief that when ICO became aware 
that the Metropolitan Police were conducting yet another investigation involving more

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHwrong doings by the Press, they decided to pre-empt and deflect any criticism which 
was bound to be directed towards them in relation to their lack of action against the 
Press in Operation Motorman.
“All the evidence published in this report had been gathered and had been available 
since  March  2003,  so  if  as  David  Smith  stated,  again  in  the  Panorama  Report,  ICO 
wanted to send “an effective and final warning” then why did it take over three years to 
prepare it, and not publish it until 13 months after the prosecution against Whittamore 
had concluded.”

1.27  These  are  stark  allegations,  which  Mr  Thomas  firmly  invited  the  Inquiry  to  reject.  One  of 
his reasons was that Mr Owens’ evidence must be regarded as unreliable as he had parted 
from the ICO on unhappy terms and that must be taken to have clouded his judgment on 
this matter. However, insofar as this Report comes to any conclusions on these issues it does 
so  on  their  own  merits  rather  than  on  the  basis  of  speculation  by  Mr  Owens  on  matters 
not  within  his  personal  knowledge.  On  the  other  hand  there  is  no  reason  to  doubt  that 
Mr  Owens’  evidence  was,  at  least,  an  authentic  description  of  his  own  perspective. 
Furthermore, it cannot be overlooked that, by their own accounts, the senior management 
of the ICO had placed Mr Owens and his immediate superior in a position  in which their 
perspectives were operationally determinative: it was a matter for them. 

1.28 

I start from this proposition. The evidential ‘treasure trove’ of the Motorman material, the 
questions of public interest and of the integrity of the data protection regime, the seriousness 
of  the  breaches  of  trust  evidently  involved  and  the  potential  harm  occasioned  to  a  very 
large number of individuals  all make it very hard to reconcile the evident lack of analysis 
or a discernible action plan in the ICO for consideration of criminal investigations into press 
misconduct. Whether, in the end, the decision was taken to pursue those investigations or not, 
the matter should have been consciously and conscientiously considered and decided upon 
from an operational and strategic point of view. The decisions should have been reasoned 
and recorded. The evidence is that this did not happen. It is possible (although I do not say 
more) that a significant opportunity was thereby lost to challenge and check elements in the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press that were insufficiently mindful of the law, the rights 
and entitlements of individuals, the public interest and the obligations of good practice.

1.29  Before reaching any firm conclusions, however, it is also necessary to provide the context 
of the alternatives available to the ICO, the choices made and the outcomes in practice. Mr 
Thomas said:38

“it’s important to record that prosecution is not the only way to deal with a particular 
problem.”

Operation Motorman was clear evidence of a problem in the culture, practices and ethics of 
the press. It was not dealt with by criminal investigation and prosecution. The ICO was, on 
its own account, not primarily a prosecuting authority; it was a statutory regulator, provided 
with a range of standard regulatory powers and had a range of other powers and operational 
choices available. 

1.30  Mr Thomas shared with the Inquiry the thought that there might even have been a causative 
relationship between his understanding from his staff that the prosecution of journalists was 
not  a  plausible  option,  and  his  decision  to  take  the  matter  to  the  PCC.  He  accepted  that 
thought was to a degree ex post facto rationalisation, and it is not certain from the chronology 

38  p70, lines 8-10, Richard Thomas, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-

1039

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsHthat it can have been the case (he also said elsewhere that the reason he refused to go into 
operational detail with the PCC was that the prosecutions were still “under way.”)39 But, in 
the light of the eclipse of the prosecution option, the way he put the position of the ICO in 
relation to what the evidence discovered in Operation Motorman revealed about the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press must surely be regarded as authentic:40

“We can’t leave it there. We must do something.”

The ‘something’ in Mr Thomas’s mind was his twin-track political strategy. But the question 
also has powerful operational resonance. If the ICO was not to tackle the press by the route 
of criminal investigation, the ‘something’ else must be considered.

2.  the use of regulatory powers
2.1 

One of the striking features of the narrative that started with Operation Motorman is that 
neither during the criminal investigation nor at any time thereafter does it appear that there 
was any evaluation of alternative operational steps which remained available. On the contrary, 
the ICO appears to have put faith only in prosecution and the twin track strategy championed 
personally by Mr Thomas. However, the ‘treasure trove’ of material gave rise to a number of 
important operational issues and permitted a variety of regulatory responses.

2.2 

2.3 

2.4 

There  was  certainly  the  question  of  future  deterrence,  which  featured  so  prominently  in 
Mr Thomas’ campaign. There was also the wider operational question already noted: it was 
unlikely that Mr Whittamore was the sole operator in this evidently lucrative market, so how 
big, in fact, was the problem? This was something to which only the press, as drivers of the 
market as evidenced by the Motorman material, were likely to be able to provide a clear 
answer.

There were issues at a more specific level as well. The Motorman material suggested that the 
press was in possession of a quantity of material in breach of the data protection principles 
and of the rights of the individuals involved. If their acquisition of that material was unlawful, 
then their continuing holding and use of the material was likely to be unlawful and unfair 
also. Motorman raised questions not merely of past illegality (obtaining the information) but 
of present and continuing illegality. 

That,  indeed,  was  the  distinguishing  feature  of  the  role  of  the  press  in  the  narrative.  The 
blaggers  and  the  corrupt  officials  and  employees  could  be  identified  and  their  practices 
terminated.  But,  unless  they  had  taken  active  steps  (which  might  include  destruction)  in 
relation to the personal information, the press were likely to be persisting in conduct unlawful 
under the data protection regime on a daily basis. Even holding information unlawfully and 
unfairly is a potential breach, whether or not accompanied by further breaches, intended 
breaches, or indeed any further plans or actions at all. Every day which passed raised acute 
practical and operational issues in relation to the press. How much personal information were 
they holding unlawfully, and how should the situation be remedied and lawfulness assured? 
These issues were live and acute, and not even prosecution of the press would have been a 
complete answer to them. Although criminal investigation would have got to the bottom of 
the specimen cases pursued and no doubt would have had a salutary chilling effect of some 
sort on unlawful practice, it could never have been the thorough-going systemic look at the 
Motorman material in the hands of the press, nor the systemic rectification of any continuing 
unlawfulness, which the evidence required.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH2.5 

2.6 

2.7 

The seizure of the Motorman material was, in other words, a very major case of the sort which 
statutory regulators are created (and given practical powers) to deal with. The press were 
under continuing legal obligations to consider what steps were needed to clean up their own 
operations from the products of the unlawful trade in personal information. Even if defences 
may have been available in some cases to criminal charges, a significant number of questions 
would have been outstanding as to the extent to which the press had complied with their 
civil legal obligations and with standards of good practice under the data protection regime.

It is therefore significant that Mr Thomas confirmed that the ICO did not, at any point, come 
close to considering the use of the civil enforcement powers at their disposal either to seek 
further information from the press or to require them to comply with the data protection 
regime. Evidently, “some sort of passing thought was given to it but nothing materialised”. 
That was for two principal reasons. The first was that these powers were, in any event, rarely 
used. The second was that “everybody knew that to a very large extent the powers of the 
office were very constrained indeed when it came to dealing with the media”.41

It is evident, as considered at the outset of this Part of the Report, that there were questions 
about  the  operational  experience  in  the  ICO  at  the  time  of  the  deployment  of  its  formal 
regulatory  powers,  and  particularly  so  in  relation  to  the  press.  That  is  further  considered 
below, as is the question whether the investigative and enforcement powers of the ICO in 
relation to the press were, indeed, as a matter of law insufficient to allow the questions raised 
for the press by Motorman to be effectively tackled by the regulator. 

2.8 

At this stage, it is sufficient to articulate the following concerns:

(a) 

(b) 

The  Inquiry  saw  no  evidence  that  any  of  these  matters  were  the  subject  of  serious 
consideration within the ICO.
The Inquiry received a quantity of evidence as to how far the Motorman material could 
be considered prima facie evidence of criminality on the part of journalists (not least 
because of the question of intent), but it is not credible to argue otherwise than that it 
was prima facie evidence of extensive unlawful and unethical data protection practice.
(c)  Whether the press would have had an answer to that prima facie unlawfulness certainly 
fell to be considered and, to such extent as it did, so the evidence is that the ICO was of 
the view that that was highly unlikely to be the case.42 The substantive exemptions from 
the principles and rights of the data protection regime in favour of the press may have 
been extensive, but they were not limitless. It was not open to the ICO on the evidence 
of the Motorman material to conclude with any confidence that the press had been 
acting within its rights so far as personal information privacy was concerned. 
The procedural hurdles standing in the way of formal proceedings by the ICO against 
the press may have been daunting – but it is not credible that Parliament intended 
them to be insuperable. If ever an operational data protection issue arose where active 
contemplation of regulatory action in respect of the press presented itself (I put it  no 
higher), Motorman was surely that case.

Afternoon-Hearing-9-December-2011.pdf
42  That much is apparent from the way in which the ICO analysed the Motorman entries into those ‘positively known 
to constitute a breach of the DPA 1998’ [5,025], those ‘considered to be probable illicit transactions’ [6,330] and the 
balance ‘lacking sufficient identification or information … to determine whether they represent illicit transactions or 
otherwise’ [1988]: pp1-2, para 8, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Fifth-Witness-

1041

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsH2.9 

(e)  Not only was there no evidence that serious operational attention was given to these 
issues, either at the time or at any point since, it is noteworthy that at no stage since 
the Motorman material was found has the ICO raised as an issue the sufficiency of its 
powers to tackle breach of the data protection regime by the press. 

In relation to this last point, at no point during his long campaign on custodial penalties did 
Mr Thomas seek reform of the provisions applying the civil law to the press. The present 
Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, does not do so today. That left the Inquiry 
with  the  question  of  whether  the  powers  available  to  the  ICO  were  in  fact  adequate  for 
the task of pursuing with the press the continuing operational issues raised by Motorman, 
but were neglected by the ICO; or whether they were inadequate, and the ICO has chosen, 
for whatever reason, not to draw attention to their inadequacy. Both Commissioners have 
strongly argued on these points that they have other priorities and that, whatever the legal 
position, it would not have been right for them to place the practices of the press among 
those priorities. I reflect on that in due course.

2.10  Not  for  the  last  time  in  this  Report,  a  haunting  question  asked  by  Mr  Owens  arises.  He 
described  himself  musing  on  the  operational  implications  for  the  press  of  the  Motorman 
material in this way:43

“It’s our job to take them or indeed anyone else on, that’s what we are paid to do. If 
we do not do it, then who does?”

The  question  is  even  more  pertinent  in  relation  to  civil  law  enforcement  under  the  data 
protection  regime  than  it  was  to  the  question  of  prosecution.  The  CPS  can  always  take 
prosecution  decisions  (including  in  relation  to  s55)  and  consider  the  matter  from  the 
perspective of the totality of any apparent criminality. Only the ICO is able to take regulatory 
enforcement action. If anything, the pertinence of this question has only increased over time.

2.11  None  of  this  is  to  suggest  that  the  ICO  should  have  had  recourse  to  testing  its  formal 
investigatory and enforcement powers in practice in this case, but simply that it might have 
been expected to give the question urgent and detailed consideration. No regulator would 
expect as a matter of routine to make the formal assertion of its powers its first reaction, 
although in an egregious or systemic case (and Motorman was surely such a case) that may be 
appropriate. To the extent that criminal proceedings remained in active contemplation there 
would in any event have been a need for detailed consideration of the potential interactions 
between criminal and civil investigations. However, if not formal action, possibly as a prelude 
to the active consideration of formal action, the operational imperative to ‘do something’ 
about the Motorman problem with the press might at least have been expected to direct the 
mind of the ICO to the possible effectiveness of a range of informal steps.

3.  engagement with the industry: guidance and 

promoting good practice
Under the DPA, the ICO has a general legal obligation to:44

3.1 

“promote the following of good practice by data controllers and, in particular, so to 
perform his functions under this Act as to promote the observance of the requirements 
of this Act by data controllers”.

1042

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH3.2 

The press organisations involved in the Motorman case were undoubtedly data controllers 
for these purposes and ‘good practice’ can refer to standards over and above the strict legal 
requirements  of  the  data  protection  regime.  Therefore,  even  assuming  that  the  ICO  had 
considered that, in the case of the press, its own powers were too restricted or restrictive 
for formal regulatory action to be the best way to proceed, its duty to promote good practice 
would still have been engaged. Mr Thomas described his entire twin-track strategy to have 
been undertaken in furtherance of his duty to promote good practice but the duty was also 
relevant to the operational imperative. That imperative was to tackle the questions raised by 
the fact that, so far as the ICO had reason to believe, the Motorman material remained in 
the hands of the press in circumstances which, at the very least, raised specific and systemic 
questions of good practice, standards and ethics.

The first recourse of a regulator is not usually to formal proceedings. In those circumstances, 
it is more usual to make informal contact in order to follow up an apparent problem (which is 
any practice falling short of desirable standards), hear the other side of the case, and seek to 
engage in a detailed dialogue about the nature and extent of the problem and the steps which 
might be taken to address it satisfactorily. At the very least, the Motorman material revealed 
to  the  ICO  that  the  press  had  engaged  in  questionable  practice  in  relation  to  individuals’ 
information, that it remained in possession of that information in circumstances which, again 
at the very least, raised questions about their conformity with good practice, and that good 
practice would require some contemplation from the individuals’ point of view as to whether 
steps were needed to improve the situation. But the Inquiry saw no evidence that any of 
these matters, any informal approach to the press data controllers or any assessment of the 
immediate practical steps suggested by good practice, were actively contemplated let alone 
put into effect.

3.3  Mr Thomas said that he did, indeed, have it in mind to write to the various journalists and 
editors involved, drawing attention to the fact that they were ‘incredibly lucky’ not to have 
been prosecuted (or, it might have been added, not to have been made the subject of formal 
investigatory or regulatory action).45 Pressed as to why no attempt was in fact ever made 
to engage with the individual newspapers, his answer was that, in going to the PCC, he had 
“dealt  with  them  all  collectively”.46  Apart  from  the  identified  concern  that  this  suggests  a 
lack of understanding of the role and responsibilities of the PCC, it implies that these were 
mutually exclusive approaches. It also suggests that there was no imperative to deal with the 
problem in the short term and in a practical way: that is to say, to address the issue not just 
of the press ceasing to commission further unlawful trade in personal information but also of 
what it was doing with the information already in its possession as a result of that trade. As 
noted above, the PCC itself urged Mr Thomas to engage directly with the industry and, in any 
event, showed little appetite to take the responsibility that Mr Thomas wished to pass on.

3.4 

It is also significant that there seems to have been no attempt to engage directly with the press 
(even indirectly, through the PCC) in the run up to the publication of What Price Privacy?47 
That report was of course conceived principally from the perspective of a policy decision to 
the effect that the introduction of custodial penalties for s55 was to be the principal means of 
impacting on the unlawful trade in personal data. Considered, however, from an operational 
point of view, the lack of engagement with the press or any part of it on either the text or the

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsHdata tables is both striking and surprising. It afforded the industry no possibility of verifying 
the data (the consequences of which, in at least one case, are considered further below). 
It also missed what might very well have been the prime opportunity to discuss with the 
industry what practical lessons could be learned and what steps they ought to have taken or 
be taking not only to remedy any persistent problems, but also to secure good practice for 
the future. A not insignificant ‘carrot’ might have been a willingness to include an account on 
that exchange in the report to Parliament, thereby demonstrating that the press were taking 
the issue seriously. 

3.5  Mr Thomas, however, said that he simply relied on the publications of his reports to Parliament 
to engender awareness amongst proprietors and editors at the national level of the ICO’s 
concerns.48 In relation to What Price Privacy? he reported:49

“I  would  say  that  was  promoting  good  practice,  and  sending  it  to  a  hundred 
organisations with specific personalised letters saying ‘this is not acceptable’ … I would 
say this is very much promoting good practice.”

3.6 

In reality, however, this was all rather late. It was three years after the event by which time the 
audit trail in relation to the Motorman material in the hands of the press was likely to have 
gone very cold indeed. Three aspects of the conduct of the ICO are difficult to understand. 
The first is that if it was possible to prepare a large individual awareness exercise, complete 
with personalised letters in order to draw attention to What Price Privacy?, and if that was 
seen as an effective way to discharge the duty of the ICO to promote good practice, there is 
no reason why similar attempts could not have been made at the time to contact the industry 
directly. Second, while making every allowance for the decision to approach the PCC as a form 
of collective engagement with the press, the ICO did not recommend specific good practice 
steps to be promulgated to the industry as well as ‘general condemnation’. Third, when it was 
becoming increasingly clear that the PCC was not going to act as an effective interlocutor with 
the industry on behalf of the ICO’s operational concerns, even then, the ICO did not seek to 
communicate directly with the industry itself. 

3.7 

Even  after  the  publication  of  What  Price  Privacy?  the  process  of  preparing  and  issuing 
effective good practice guidance to the press was faltering and inconclusive. Of the document 
eventually produced, Mr Thomas said:50

“It was a useful guidance note but I suppose I was a little concerned that it buried the 
section 55 warnings into a wider context of talking about the Data Protection Act and 
its application to the media more generally, and I think even now I would say that it 
was a shame it didn’t just focus on section 55 in the way that our own note, which we 
produced, I think, in 2006 or 2007, what we call a good practice note, that was a very, 
very clear one and a half pager as to how the press should take seriously section 55.”

In  reality,  the  ICO  did  not  direct  the  press  towards  the  practical  steps  it  needed  to  take, 
not  least  in  the  maintenance  of  proper  audit  trails  in  relation  to  its  handling  of  personal 
information  (especially,  as  Mr  Thomas  had  noted,  in  the  event  of  an  intention  to  rely  on 
the  public  interest  as  a  defence  to  s55).  Rather,  the  process  had  become  absorbed  into 
managing the defensive stance of the press in response to the s55 campaign. A part of that 
response was the alleged discomfort of the press with applying legal public interest tests, 
notwithstanding the obvious centrality of judgments on the public interest to the routine

Public interest judgements were also the daily bread and butter of the FOI regime which also 
fell within the ICO’s regulatory remit and on which extensive and detailed guidance has been 
published. Rather than pursuing the idea that the PCC would guide the press on this matter 
operationally, along with the other possible lines of approach, it was eminently feasible for 
the ICO simply to grip the issue both efficiently and expeditiously. 

3.9 

Furthermore,  the  ICO  was  under  a  continuing  legal  obligation  to  promote  good  practice, 
including by considering the issue of guidance, either specific or general. It is not easy to 
understand why the ICO persisted for years in trying to force the hand of the PCC to issue 
guidance when it had statutory powers of its own to do so; moreover, these were statutory 
powers which it was under a legal obligation to keep under constant review. Having diagnosed 
a need for guidance, and in the absence of a satisfactory and timely response from the PCC, it 
could have propelled the process forward with a comprehensive draft of its own, if necessary 
in direct consultation with the industry. There is no evidence that it contemplated doing so.

3.10  As noted above, one of the issues of contention between the ICO and the PCC over the course 
of its dialogue was the demand of the PCC for access to the detail of the Motorman material 
before it would consider itself able to take direct action on any matter with the press (this 
was Sir Christopher Meyer’s request for ‘beef’). The DPA includes a number of provisions 
inhibiting disclosure by the ICO of confidential material it has acquired in the exercise of its 
functions;51 this is a very standard feature of regulatory regimes. Those provisions would have 
inhibited the public disclosure of the Motorman material, and were an operative reason for 
the presentation of the material in the What Price Privacy? reports in summarised form only. 
Those provisions might also have rightly restrained the ICO from detailed disclosure to the 
PCC. But they would not have restrained discussion by the ICO of the relevant parts of the 
Motorman material with the individual press organisations (data controllers) concerned for 
the purposes of furthering their compliance with the legal or good practice requirements of 
the regime. At the point at which Mr Thomas declined to share the detail of the Motorman 
material with the PCC, he effectively acknowledged that detailed and specific discussions could 
only ever have taken place directly between the ICO and the individual press organisations.

3.11  On his own account, Mr Thomas was emphatic about the lack of engagement directly by the 
ICO with the press. When giving evidence, he told the Inquiry that “I don’t think I’ve ever had 
a conversation to this day with an editor”52 (although when prompted he recalled that he had, 
of course, spoken to editors, including Mr Dacre, in the context of his interactions with the 
Editors’ Code Committee). But again, it was only the ICO that could have conversations with 
individual  press  organisations  about  their  continued  retention  of  the  Motorman  material; 
there was nobody else.

4.  Engagement with victims
4.1 

The Motorman material was evidence in the hands of the ICO that a very large number of 
people appeared to have been the victims of unlawful use of their personal information. Those 
individuals had rights and entitlements under the DPA, and in the civil law more generally, 
including rights in relation to confidence and privacy. The data protection regime, in common 
with very many other regulatory regimes, provides for two routes of law enforcement. These 
are the exercise of investigatory and enforcement powers by the regulator and the availability 
of rights of action by individuals for the enforcement of the law in their own cases.

4.3

4.5 

4.6 

One  of  the  defining  features  of  contravention  of  information  privacy  law  is  that, 
characteristically, the victim may not be aware that it has happened or, if aware, may have 
no means to find out how it happened, who was responsible, or indeed to move beyond 
the  realms  of  speculation.53  This  feature  was  both  obvious  and  commonplace  when 
consideration was directed to the Motorman material, and was equally a very real concern 
which was underlined in the evidence of a number of Core Participants who complain about 
press intrusion.54 The ignorance of victims of the nature, or even existence, of the wrong 
done to them is, indeed, a principal reason for the existence of a regulatory authority with 
investigative legal powers.

The two approaches to law enforcement are not, of course, mutually exclusive. Christopher 
Graham expressed the connection by describing what he saw as a core element of the ICO’s 
job: ‘to arm the consumer, to educate and empower the consumer to exercise their information 
rights and to help them to assert them.’55 That role operates at both the general, educative 
level, and at the level of assisting individuals who have concerns, including for example by 
helping  them  to  make  subject  access  requests.56  Where  the  ICO  comes  upon  evidence  of 
unlawful activity of which the victim is not aware, it has some important operational choices 
to make. Matters to be taken into account will include the quality of the evidence, the nature 
and  extent  of  the  apparent  breach,  whether  or  not  it  is  continuing,  the  practicalities  of 
contacting victims, and so on. These were considerations which were brought to bear, for 
example, in the operation the ICO undertook in the wake of the loss by HMRC in late 2007 
of discs containing large quantities of personal information relating to the recipients of child 
benefit. In part, at least, that was for the purposes of alerting the victims to the potential 
need  to  take  security  measures  against  the  possibility  of  the  information  falling  into  the 
wrong hands and being used for fraudulent or other unlawful purposes in the future.

No such exercise appears to have been contemplated in the Motorman case, a matter which 
was directly raised in the Inquiry by potentially affected Core Participants. As noted above, 
Mr  Owens’  team  did  approach  some  30  to  40  victims  for  the  purposes  of  their  criminal 
investigation,  and  obtained  witness  statements.  But  engaging  victims  on  the  footing  of  a 
criminal investigation is a specific and limited kind of exercise and there is no evidence that 
the ICO engaged even those victims it approached for any broader purpose.

Aside from the primacy given to the criminal investigation at the time, Mr Thomas suggested 
that there were two principal reasons for failing to engage with the victims. The first was 
logistics, given the large number involved. The second was considerations of privacy, on the 
basis  that  alerting  victims  could  raise  questions  about  possible  further  invasions  of  their 
privacy, as might occur, for example, if third parties (including the victims’ family members) 
came to be aware of information about them which the victim had been at pains to conceal.57

Neither of these explanations fully accounts for the failure to take any operational hold of the 
situation affecting the Motorman victims, although both concerns are certainly important 
and relevant. The former is a strategic challenge of a sort which the ICO has addressed on 
other occasions. The latter is a matter of process, and of a nature which the ICO was well-
placed to address. Neither points to complete inaction; neither would be insuperable given 
case by case consideration. 

53  This feature is noted and explained in Part F, Chapter 6

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH4.7 

4.8 

4.9 

The consequences of the failure to alert the victims were much debated before the Inquiry. 
The ICO had placed considerable faith in the success of the political measures they took in 
response to Motorman to ensure that there was an effective stop to further victimisation 
for the future. It is, however, hard to avoid the conclusion that the position from the point 
of view of the victims was insufficiently taken into account, not merely operationally for the 
ICO, but also as a matter of respect for their rights and entitlements and so that they could 
properly consider their own law enforcement options, and take measures to deal with the 
risks of further victimisation to which they could be subjected. That conclusion was also part 
of Mr Owens’ reflections:58

“We  also  had  the  unanswered  outstanding  question  relating  to  the  remaining 
thousands of people who had never been told they had been a victim of crime having 
had their car checked, their ex directory telephone number unlawfully obtained, their 
private lists of family and friends sold to the Press and so on…. I also felt very strongly 
that the thousands of victims identified in Operation Motorman also had a right to 
know they had been victims.”

The extent to which the perspective of the victims was overlooked may be connected with 
the fact that the seriousness of the wrongdoing suggested by the Motorman material led the 
ICO in two directions (prosecution and the campaign on s55) which were both in the criminal 
domain.  Exclusive  focus  on  the  criminal  aspects  of  what  had  been  discovered,  without 
consideration of the wider regulatory context, carried a potential (if not an inevitable) risk 
that the victims would be left out of the picture. That risk is evident in both the operational 
and political reaction of the ICO to Motorman.

The obvious question arising from the failure to alert the victims has come to the fore in 
relation to all of the paths not taken by the ICO in response to Motorman: why, given the 
obvious operational magnitude and seriousness of this case, was action evidently given such 
a low priority? This is not a theoretical or historical question. The position of the victims was 
a  contemporary  issue  for  the  Inquiry.  While  the  prospects,  in  practical  reality,  of  the  ICO 
taking criminal or regulatory action in relation to Motorman may be regarded (absent further, 
fresher, evidence) as long since extinguished, individual victims expressed their concerns in 
terms of whether their involvement in Motorman might not have been part of a much wider 
context of their treatment at the hands of the press. There remained alive in their minds 
that question which Mr Owens said he had wanted to pursue: why did the press want their 
information? And the follow-up questions also arose, including what did they do with it and 
where was it now? This was the subject of a further ruling.59 

4.10  Of  all  of  the  questions  which  arose  before  the  Inquiry  about  the  operational  steps  which 
the ICO could have taken in response to the Motorman material, this question of alerting 
the victims has clearly remained the most acute, notwithstanding the intervening years. For 
individuals, the question of what information a business holds about them, and what that 
business is doing with that information, is one of the core entitlements afforded by the data 
protection regime. The affected Core Participants indeed felt sufficiently strongly about this 
issue that they pressed the Inquiry itself to undertake a disclosure exercise in relation to the 
Motorman material. For reasons set out in a further ruling the Inquiry concluded that that

1047

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsHwas not an appropriate focus of its own attention.60 But it clearly remains a live issue for at 
least some of the victims; and of course in referring to victims, only a very small proportion of 
those who were the subjects of material acquired by the press via Mr Whittamore, have had 
that fact confirmed to them to this day.

4.11 

In the circumstances, the Inquiry considered it appropriate to seek the views of the current 
Information Commissioner, Mr Graham, on the position of the Motorman victims from the 
perspective of the present day. The relevant Core Participants are also understood to have 
approached him with a general inquiry. In his oral evidence, Mr Graham responded in this 
way:61

“I had a letter last night, and no doubt this will be coming up later in the evidence, 
saying why have I not made contact with every individual whose name is mentioned 
in  the  Motorman  file?  And  part  of  the  answer  to  that  is  going  to  be  I  would  have 
to  take  on  a  veritable  army  of  extra  people.  I’m  also  going  to  say  I  don’t  think  it’s 
necessary, but this isn’t practical. All regulators have to pick their battles, prioritise 
their resources, and I just need some evidence of there being a problem before I divert 
resources to do it.”

4.12  Mr Graham was not here necessarily disputing that there was evidence of a problem at the 
time of the discovery of the Motorman material, but was questioning whether there was still 
a problem today. That line in his thinking, and the question of the prioritisation of operational 
resources, are considered more fully below. But Mr Graham also suggested that there were 
two further practical problems.

4.13 

In the first place, he reiterated Mr Thomas’s anxiety about occasioning further invasions of 
privacy:62

“I think Richard Thomas put the point very well in his response to you on this matter, 
when he said: if, having established the identity of the individual and their address, we 
wrote to them to say simply, “Your details appear in the Motorman file, we can’t tell 
you why”, that might be an even greater breach of privacy than the original offence, 
because  there  would  be  a  suggestion  that  there’s  no  smoke  without  fire.  Other 
members of the family might see the letter and say, “Hey, what’s going on?” and I 
couldn’t tell them any more than a name appears in a file.”

The Inquiry is not persuaded that what is a perfectly fair concern about further invasions 
of privacy provides a reason for declining to contemplate alerting victims, nor that the risk 
of alerting third parties is one which could not, and cannot, reasonably be managed both 
through the means of communication and through the content.

4.14  Mr Graham advanced a second practical problem:63

“The  difficulty  about  simply  contacting  everybody  lies  in  the  nature  of  the  dossiers 
themselves. Mr Jay, you’ve seen them. I don’t know whether all the core participants 
are in that position, but these are notebooks, and sometimes the information contained 
in them is deeply obscure. I said in my witness statement that the individual who made

1048

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHthe notes must have had a perfect understanding of what he was intending, but it isn’t 
always clear. That partly explains why there’s sometimes a discrepancy between the 
spreadsheets that we’ve compiled and the notebooks. If you said to me, “You ought to 
notify everybody whose name appears in the Motorman files”, I’d be hard pressed to 
do that. It isn’t just a question of resources, it’s it isn’t immediately clear who is being 
referred to, because it isn’t just celebrities, it’s all sorts of people who may or may not 
be part of a story concerning a celebrity or whatever it is; it’s just a name. Sometimes 
it’s just a surname….It would be a phenomenal undertaking. Just because there’s a 
name, John Smith, I would then have to work out which John Smith. The example I 
gave to the Select Committee was Ziggy Stardust, that’s a bit easier to do, but there 
are an awful lot of very anonymous names and it simply isn’t practical.” 

That may be a convincing explanation for the impossibility of contacting everyone involved in 
the Motorman material. It is not a convincing explanation for not contacting anyone.

4.15  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  a  serious  piece  of  work  would  be  required  for  the  ICO  to 
undertake a wholesale review of the Motorman victims, and legitimate questions do arise 
about resources and priority. Mr Graham had his own suggestion about the way ahead:64

“So far as the individuals are concerned, I’m still very ready for subject access requests 
by those who may be concerned….if Hacked Off and their lawyers are representing 
particular individuals, then that’s what we’re here for; subject access requests, off we 
go.”

Subject  access  requests  allow  individuals  to  exercise  their  entitlement  under  the  data 
protection regime to know from any business whether it holds information about them and, 
if  so,  what.  They  are  not  a  straightforward  answer  to  the  problem.  Unless  individuals  are 
already aware that a given title holds their information, the right could be exercised only 
by  a  speculative  correspondence  across  a  range  of  newspapers  and  periodicals,  at  some 
inconvenience and expense to both the person requesting and the subject of the request. 
This therefore appears to be a paradigm case in which a statutory regulator could be expected 
actively to consider providing assistance.

4.16  There is, no doubt, a range of practical solutions to this issue which both the ICO and the 
industry could have offered to the Motorman victims at any point up to and including the 
present. One possible way forward would be for concerned individuals to be able to apply to 
the ICO seeking to obtain confirmation (in so far as the ICO is able to offer it) as to whether 
they can be identified among the Motorman victims and, if so, information as to the title or 
titles concerned and assistance, if necessary, in making a suitable request to those titles.

4.17 

If interest in exercising that right reached proportions beyond the capability of the ICO, then 
perhaps the press organisations could be directed or encouraged each to undertake its own 
victim contact exercise under the ICO’s supervision.65 So far as the ICO is concerned, at any 
rate, this suggests a course of action within its easily accessible knowledge and, subject to 
reasonable prioritisation, within its capability. This could have discharged its general functions 
to satisfactory effect. There is no evidence that it was willing to turn its mind to any such 
possibility, either at the time or since.

64  pp44-46, lines 23-13, Christopher Graham, ibid 
65 The Core Participants (including press Core Participants) have had access to the Motorman material under strict 
conditions of confidentiality and only for the duration of the Inquiry. There is no reason that has been suggested, 
however, why the Information Commissioner should not engage with the press and facilitate some mechanism 
whereby this process could be put in place

1049

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsH5.  Conclusions and the questions raised by Operation 

5.1 

Motorman
Operation Motorman was prima facie evidence of systemic and serious malpractice by the 
press in relation to the acquisition and use of personal information. It was also one of the 
biggest cases of deliberate and systemic data abuse of any sort to come to the attention of 
the ICO. In the view of the ICO itself the journalistic practices it disclosed on the face of it: 

(a)  were widespread and systemic;
(b)  were probably criminal;
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f)  were unlikely to be an isolated example; and
(g) 

suggested extensive and continuing breaches of the data protection principles;
suggested large-scale and continuing breach of individual rights;
at the least raised serious questions about standards and proper practices by the press;

had  implications  for  the  integrity  of  personal  information,  a  number  of  public  and 
private databases, and the data protection regime as a whole.

5.2 

5.3 

Additionally, it was apparent to the ICO that the industry was not (at any rate at the time) 
denying that there was a problem.66

This called for a commensurate response from the ICO which dealt with all aspects of the 
problem and included challenging the practices and safeguarding both the information and 
the position of the victims involved. It also presented a clear opportunity for a regulatory 
body  to  demonstrate  publicly  the  importance  and  effectiveness  of  the  data  protection 
regime in safeguarding the public interest in information privacy. The ICO was the best-placed 
organisation to grasp the implications of the Motorman material as a whole and to take a 
decisive lead, working with other public authorities including the police and with the industry 
itself, to ensure that a comprehensive and effective response was made to the evidence that 
it disclosed of problems in the culture, practices and ethics of the press.

From an operational point of view, the ICO’s response to the Motorman material was not 
commensurate  with  the  scale  of  the  problem  disclosed.  The  Information  Commissioner 
ultimately  considered  that  the  problem  was  big  enough  for  it  to  trouble  Parliament  and 
Government  at  the  highest  levels,  including  the  Prime  Minister.  The  contrast  with  the 
insufficiency  of  its  operational  response  is  all  the  more  obvious.  The  ICO  is  principally  an 
operational regulator, endowed with legal powers and functions to be exercised in the public 
interest. Its principal role is not to act as a political campaigning body but to discharge its 
regulatory functions at a practical level.

5.4 

In particular, from an operational perspective, it appears that: 

(a) 

(b) 

there was an insufficiently strategic grasp of the operational issues and options facing 
the organisation as a result of the material for fully informed decisions to be taken, or 
for the results to be followed through;
the senior management of the ICO in practice gave insufficient priority to the operational 
dimension of the Motorman material;

1050

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

the course of conduct of the criminal investigations was unsatisfactorily managed, with 
the result that opportunities were missed to address potential criminality in the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press;

insufficient consideration was given to alternative operational strategies, both formal 
and informal, for addressing the matter;

in particular, the failure to give serious contemplation to engaging directly with either 
the data controllers in the press or the data subject victims is difficult to reconcile with 
the general duties of the ICO or with a recognisably considered approach to weighing 
up its operational priorities.

5.5 

It also appears that there was insufficient connection between the operational work of the 
ICO on the Motorman case and the strategic or political choices made by the Information 
Commissioner to respond to the issue at a higher level, that is to say, by engaging in dialogue 
with the PCC and campaigning on s55. As a result, those choices were insufficiently well-
informed  and  effective,  and  not  appropriately  targeted  at  the  issues  about  the  culture, 
practices and ethics of the press disclosed by the Motorman material.

5.6 

In particular, while it was not unreasonable to think it worth exploring the contribution the 
PCC could make to addressing the problem presented by the Motorman material, the strategy 
lacked from the outset:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

clearly-defined objectives and outcomes; putting a stop to the practice, condemnation 
and Code changes were propositions at too high a level of generality to be capable of 
generating a timetable or plan of action measurable in terms of identifiable changes in 
the culture, practices and ethics of the press;

a clear, informed and realistic apprehension of the nature, role and functions of the PCC 
and the contribution it might be expected to make (which is a point that Mr Thomas 
accepted); it was not satisfactory for the ICO to seek to discharge its own functions to 
any extent through an organisation such as the PCC without being very clear about its 
ability to take on and deliver that charge satisfactorily, and there is insufficient evidence 
that this was properly researched;

a detailed plan for how the ICO’s own functions would have to be brought to bear to 
ensure that the two organisations’ contributions would work together to produce the 
desired regulatory outcome;

a thought-through analysis of how the strategy of trying to engage the PCC on the one 
hand, and the political campaign on s55 on the other were likely to interact, particularly 
given the personalities involved, and plans for dealing with the potential (which might 
be thought obvious) for the objectives of each to conflict.

5.7 

These  problems  were  compounded  by  persistence  in  the  dialogue  with  the  PCC  in  a  way 
which  failed  to  be  sufficiently  focused  and  realistic,  proportionate  to  its  likely  effect  and 
effectiveness,  failed  to  keep  in  view  the  ICO’s  own  role  and  responsibilities.  In  particular, 
as it became apparent that the response of the PCC was falling short of what ICO hoped, 
opportunities  were  missed  to  reappraise  the  strategy  which  could  have  been  replaced  or 
supplemented by the direct exercise of its own powers and functions, including by way of 
issuing good practice guidance or otherwise engaging directly with the industry. 

1051

Chapter 3 | Other Possible Regulatory OptionsH5.8 

Both Mr Thomas and, latterly, Mr Graham are to be commended for the extent to which they 
have robustly sought, in the face of sustained hostility and lobbying from the press, to make 
the case publicly for better standards and to encourage rational consideration of the merits 
of the argument for increasing the sentencing maxima for s55 offences. To the extent that 
the s55 campaign can be regarded as a response to the Motorman case (and I recognise that 
it had other motivations also), it is arguable that it was problematic in:

(a) 

(b) 

the extent to which it drew the ICO into the contested political arena and away from its 
primary regulatory obligations under the DPA;

the extent to which it focused exclusively on the criminal law as a potential solution, 
and its lack of practical engagement with the limitations on the effectiveness of such 
solutions; and

(c) 

not identifying the context, either within the wider role and functions of the ICO or in 
any plan for realising any benefits that it might have been capable of yielding.

5.9 

In the light of the analysis of the response to the Motorman material, it is appropriate to 
conclude that ICO did not effectively grasp the full implications, and indeed opportunities, of 
the case. As a result:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

previous  misconduct  was  inadequately  brought  to  justice  and  was  not  otherwise 
addressed as a matter of law enforcement;

the risk of continuing breaches of law and standards was not effectively addressed;

the interests of the victims were inadequately protected; and

an important opportunity was missed to address problems in the culture, practices and 
ethics of the press in relation to the acquisition and use of personal information, which 
could have had an impact beyond the facts of the Motorman case.

In the circumstances, a real question must remain as to whether these missed opportunities 
contributed, either at a general or a specific level, to later manifestations of disregard for 
the rights of others in relation to information privacy which were subsequently exhibited by 
certain parts of the press, of which phone hacking was the most serious.

5.10 

I should make very clear that there is no evidence to suggest, as Mr Owens invited the Inquiry 
to do, that the political campaign and the publication of the What Price Privacy? reports were 
a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the ICO’s operational inactivity. To the extent 
that they drew public and political attention to the problem, they did themselves perform 
a function of acting as a warning to others in positions of authority to take action. To that 
extent, Mr Graham’s description of the role of the ICO in the Motorman story (“we are the 
good guys”) may fairly be endorsed.

5.11  The principal outstanding questions, therefore, to which the remainder of this Part of the 

Report is addressed, are these:

(a) 

Is there any reason to think that there are still causes for concern about the culture, 
practices  and  ethics  of  the  press  in  relation  to  personal  information,  whether  as  a 
matter of law or as a matter of good practice?

Introduction
The current Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, took over from Mr Thomas in 
the summer of 2009. In the context of this Inquiry, it is of interest that his previous career 
was  in  journalism,  broadcasting  and  regulation  (he  was  a  former  Director  General  of  the 
Advertising Standards Authority), rather than in law.

He told the Inquiry that the culture, practices and ethics of the press were not drawn to his 
attention on handover as an issue of top priority. He was, however, aware that commencement 
of  the  legislative  changes  to  s55  was  outstanding  and  he  made  a  connection  between 
legislative change and press conduct saying that there was:1 

“a  sword  of  Damocles  hanging  over  the  press.  If  there  was  any  repetition  of  the 
behaviour that Operation Motorman had uncovered that would be accessed pretty 
quickly.” 

In the event, he had what he described as a ‘wake up call’ a few weeks after taking up his 
appointment  when  the  story  by  Nick  Davies  about  phone  hacking  was  published  in  the 
Guardian. His principal focus thereafter was not, however, operational but political: he had to 
prepare for his appearance on 2 September 2009 before the Culture Media and Sport Select 
Committee2 which was then taking evidence specifically as a result of the emergence of the 
Goodman/Mulcaire case and the coverage in the Guardian, but linking it also with the history 
of  Operation  Motorman.  This  was  therefore  an  opportunity  for  Mr  Graham  to  take  stock 
of the history of Motorman, the role of the ICO, and the signs from the emerging hacking 
scandal that the story of press abuse of personal information was taking a new direction.

1.4 

His evidence to the Select Committee was that:

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

phone hacking was a matter for the police and the ICO had ‘no involvement whatsoever’;
any  operational  steps  the  ICO  could  have  taken  in  relation  to  Motorman  (including 
criminal  investigations  into  journalists)  would  have  been  too  difficult  practically  and 
legally and were not a priority call on resources at the time;
the priority of the ICO in relation to Motorman was to ‘sound the alarm, to warn the 
industry, to talk to the PCC, to urge the provision of a custodial penalty’ and the latter 
remained the priority;
there was little more that could now be done in relation to the Motorman material 
without more, not least because it was old and not straightforward to interpret; and

(e)  he  had  no  intention  at  this  point  of  proactively  reviewing  the  Motorman  evidence, 

because it would serve little purpose and the ICO had many other priorities.

1.5 

The question of priorities was a matter of some concern to the Committee at the time. Mr 
Graham was pressed particularly hard on the position of the victims, some of whom were

Hexpressing anger at not having been notified by the ICO of their appearance in the Motorman 
material. Mr Graham indicated that he would treat approaches from individuals  inquiring 
about their possible appearance in the Motorman material on a case by case basis. He was 
also pressed on whether the ICO had worked with the organisations, both public and private 
sector,  whose  information  had  been  wrongly  disclosed  in  the  Motorman  case;  a  certain 
amount of work had been done but various factors had limited the extent of the engagement. 
These included the increasing general insecurity of information of all sorts, the flourishing 
illegal  trade  in  information  procurement,  and  the  risk  that  any  investigation  would  itself 
present a risk of the further dissemination of the personal information in question

1.6 

It  is  not  necessary  to  consider  Mr  Graham’s  evidence  to  the  Select  Committee  in  detail, 
because  the  same  ground  was  explored  in  the  course  of  his  evidence  to  the  Inquiry.  His 
general update to the Committee on the work of the ICO work with the press at that time is, 
however, interesting. He said:3

“We started off by a general call to the industry which, indeed, was heeded to some 
extent in that the Editors’ Code Committee eventually amended clause 10 of the Code, 
made it much tougher, and we have done a lot of work with the PCC in training editors. 
We  have  done  a  couple  of  seminars,  one  in  London  and  one  in  Scotland,  to  make 
sure that journalists understand that this is serious. I saw a copy of the Editors’ Code 
Handbook the other day and it makes it very clear that you mix with the Data Protection 
Act at your peril and you had better have a very solid public interest story very well 
documented, in order to do that. Chairman, the interesting question is why did not any 
of those titles that were listed in What Price Privacy Now? contact the Information 
Commissioner’s Office and say, “This is terrible, 45 of our journalists apparently have 
been doing this thing which we utterly condemn, tell us who they are”, and we then 
might have been able to talk turkey. Interestingly, of 305 journalists, and we listed the 
total in the document, we have not had a single inquiry from a journalist saying, “Am I 
on that list? Was I doing something wrong?”

1.7 

1.8 

1.9 

The Inquiry has also had to consider the question of the lack of press interest in pursuing 
the Motorman evidence but it is also important to look at the position from the perspective 
of the ICO. Its own stocktake, at the end of 2009, was that it was aware that Mr Thomas’ 
political  campaign  had  at  best  been  only  partially  successful,  and  had  also  established  a 
hostile response from the press. It knew that neither the ICO itself, nor evidently the press, 
had followed up the Motorman evidence operationally, either in relation to the particulars 
of the state and use of the information itself, the conduct of individual journalists, or its own 
practices. Finally, it was on notice of the emergence of the phone hacking scandal. 

Notwithstanding this assessment, the ICO had concluded that there was no imperative for it 
to engage further with the culture, practices and ethics of the press. In particular, Mr Graham 
expressed the view to the Select Committee in relation to the PCC that “We do not have any 
formal relationship with them, but I just accept that they do press standards and we do data 
protection and, where those two things cross over, then we probably need to talk.”

The  two  things  clearly  do  cross  over.  In  concluding  this  Part  of  the  Report,  assessing  the 
current  state  of  the  role  and  functions  of  the  ICO,  and  making  recommendations  for  the 
future, the focus returns to the key themes of the Motorman case, but viewed now from the 
contemporary perspective. Those themes are:

the extent to which there are problematic issues today which fall within the purview 
of the Information Commissioner and concern the culture, practices and ethics of the 
press in relation to personal information; 
the powers available to the ICO to tackle any such problematic issues, and whether 
they are sufficient to the task; and
the governance, capability and priorities of the ICO and whether they too are sufficient 
and appropriate to the task.

2.	 Personal	information	privacy	and	press	practices
2.1  Mr  Graham’s  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  was  that  he  did  not  believe  that  the  press  was 
significantly involved in breaches of the Data Protection Act since the publication of the What 
Price Privacy? reports, and that therefore, by implication, they had learned the lessons of 
those reports. This evidence is at the heart of the Inquiry’s terms of reference, and, given the 
way in which the phone hacking scandal developed, is not entirely obvious. It thus requires 
close analysis. 

2.2  Mr Graham put the matter in this way:4

“I  can  only  speak  of  what’s  in  my  own  knowledge,  and  I  can  only  speak  of  those 
aspects of press conduct that fall within the responsibilities of my office, and that’s 
primarily Section 55. I know that the Inquiry was triggered by concerns about hacking 
of phones and hacking of emails, these are criminal offences that don’t come under 
the Information Commissioner’s office, but Section 55 certainly does. I can’t prove a 
negative. All I can say is I’ve seen no further evidence beyond what we published in 
2006, and that of course was about behaviour before when Mr Whittamore’s office 
was raided, and much of it related to activity between 1999 and 2003. I simply offer a 
view that this is an issue of such high salience, many investigative journalists working 
in the area, great rivalry between newspaper groups, lots of campaigners, that if there 
was evidence of further breaches of Section 55 by the press, it would have been drawn 
to my attention, and it hasn’t been.”

2.3 

The latter point was one on which he expanded:5

“…there’s been so much feverish activity over the past two years in relation to this 
with the various newspaper groups, with the journalists, with the books written on 
the subject, with the campaigning groups. If the best that critics can do is to turn up 
further evidence of what was going on between 1999 and 2003, it doesn’t amount to 
much.”

2.4 

The questions raised by this evidence were many, and included:

(a)  why  s55  (the  criminal  offence  of  unlawfully  obtaining  information)  was  being  used 
as the benchmark for contravention of the regime rather than the wider scheme of 
principles and rights created by the regime;

(b)  why Mr Graham would have expected investigative journalists or other campaigners to 
have been likely to excavate issues about the press and personal information which the 
ICO, charged with legal responsibilities in that respect, was not itself minded to pursue;

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH(c)  why the ICO did not appear to consider that the phone hacking scandal itself and the 
wider issues of the culture, practices and ethics of the press before the Inquiry were a 
cause of acute concern within its own sphere;

(d)  why the ICO was able to conclude that the Motorman evidence was of no continuing 

(e) 

interest or relevance in relation to the data protection regime; and
if the ICO was unaware of any problems in relation to the press, to what extent that was 
a reasonable conclusion based on due diligence.

2.5 

The due diligence point had particularly exercised Tom Watson MP in putting the following 
questions to Mr Graham (and his ICO colleague Mr Clancy) on behalf of the Select Committee:6

“Q. What I am trying to do is ascertain responsibility in the system for getting this right. 
… Are you convinced that these practices have now ended in newsrooms up and down 
the country?” A: “I am not in a position to know.”
Q. “What I am trying to understand is that the decision you took, which, by the way, I 
think was the right decision, to blow this open, bring it into the public domain and try 
and effect massive change in the way journalists run about their work, I can understand 
why in a resource-sensitive area that is what you did, but what I cannot understand is 
why you have not gone back to see whether that has been successful or not or what 
gauge of success there is.” A: “How can we measure it? Do we go to editors and say, 
‘Have you come across any examples of journalists that have stepped over the line?’”
Q. “Is there anyone in this country who would know whether these practices are still 
going on other than editors and journalists in the newsrooms?” A: “Well, editors and 
journalists must know; it is a self-regulatory system.”
Q. “So, when they tell us that they think that they have thoroughly investigated the 
matter and they have put it right, do you think they could possibly have done that if 
they do not know the list of journalists that you have got on your files?” A: “I think there 
might be information which would identify some of those journalists because some of 
the invoices quite clearly indicate that there have been blags in relation to particular 
stories and invoice numbers. Surely, their records should be able to cross-reference that 
to  a  particular  journalist,  and  sometimes  the  invoices  cross-reference  the  stories,  so 
editors  could  examine  their  business  and  perhaps  identify  which  journalists  were  or 
were not.” 
“ Q: “ I think you could perhaps be a little proactive just to ensure that they have certainly 
done that or that they certainly have the information about the people who were at it?” 
A: “I understand what the Committee is saying, but you are not dealing with a regulator 
who is not proactive; we are proactive on a very wide front. … There are lots of ways we 
could spend our time.”

2.6 

The  due  diligence  point  itself  resolved  itself  into  a  number  of  sub-issues  relating  to  the 
question of specific follow-up to Motorman; the strategic follow-up to Mr Thomas’s political 
campaign, the response to the phone hacking scandal, and the position of the ICO in relation 
to the press today. These will be discussed in turn.

Chapter 4 | The ICO and the Press todayH3.	 Following	up	Operation	Motorman
3.1 

As is frequently repeated, Operation Motorman was the single biggest case of deliberate and 
systemic interference with personal information with which the ICO had had to deal since its 
inception. The ICO had taken no operational measures in respect of the case since handing 
over  the  Whittamore  prosecution  to  the  CPS.  There  had  been  modest  progress  in  issuing 
general guidance to the industry after years of discussion with the PCC. A custodial penalty 
for s55 offences had been provisionally introduced but not activated. This fell short of the 
steps Mr Thomas had wanted to see in order to put a stop to Motorman-type practices in 
the press for the future. The ICO remained very concerned about the evidence it continued 
to encounter of an extensive illegal market in personal information beyond the activities of 
the press. It had no reason to believe that private investigators similar to Mr Whittamore 
were not operating in the market. It is therefore necessary to consider whether there was (or 
should have been) a question mark in the mind of the ICO as to whether or not the objective 
of putting a stop to the engagement by the press in the illegal market in personal information 
had in fact been achieved.

3.2 

3.3 

That general question might resolve itself into a number of specific questions. Firstly, what 
had  happened  to  the  information  which  the  press  had  acquired  prima  facie  in  breach  of 
the data protection regime from Mr Whittamore? Secondly, what effect had the What Price 
Privacy? reports and the guidance had on the industry? Finally, what steps had the newspaper 
titles involved taken (particularly in relation to the journalists who had been identified as 
customers of Mr Whittamore) to eliminate this sort of conduct from their culture, practices 
and ethics?

On  the  follow-up  to  the  question  of  press  conduct  in  relation  to  blagging  and  related 
activities,  Mr  Graham  confirmed  to  the  Inquiry  the  position  he  had  taken  in  front  of  the 
Select Committee. The ICO had made no active investigations of any nature in relation to the 
Motorman material itself. No material had been brought to its attention suggesting that there 
was any problem. In the absence of that, it was not its role to pursue enquiries. It had other 
current priorities.7

3.4 

There was also, in his view, no case for a proactive approach to the victims. But he did say 
that “so far as the individuals are concerned, I’m still very ready for subject access requests by 
those who may be concerned.”8 

4.	 Following	up	the	political	campaign
4.1 

Before  the  Select  Committee,  Mr  Graham  appeared  to  be  continuing  to  connect  the  s55 
campaign with the issue of press misconduct. This exchange with Mr Watson was interesting 
in that context:9

Q. “But the evidence you have in front of you shows that there was law-breaking on an 
industrial scale from the newsrooms of some of the major newspapers in the United 
Kingdom.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHA.  “I  am  afraid  I  am  going  to  become  repetitive.  You  simply  cannot  run  regulatory 
bodies on the basis that you go chasing after every detail that a particular investigative 
journalist decides should be the agenda for the day when you have got other very big 
and important questions. I am not pleading poverty here, I am just saying that you can 
only do what you can do. We thought, possibly naively, that, by telling Parliament about 
this back in 2006 and calling for the custodial sentence, we could close the thing down. 
I think they still can, but it is taking too long.”

4.2 

4.3 

As noted above, the ICO has continued to press for the activation of the custodial penalties 
for s55 offences, but no longer apparently with any direct focus on making an impact on the 
press. Although not directly a matter for the Inquiry, no account has been offered of how the 
case for the activation of those penalties has been affected by the more recent availability of 
civil penalties. In any event, however, the case for the activation of the s55 penalties in so far 
as it has a bearing on the matters before the Inquiry is considered on its own merits below.

If the ICO has yet to realise the benefits of the s55 campaign (and there remains no evidence 
of any active planning within the office for doing so – the effect still appears to be considered 
to be self-activating), it seems to be continuing to reap the dividend of general press hostility. 
That too requires consideration.

5.	 Phone	hacking	and	the	ICO
5.1 

The What Price Privacy Now? follow-up report to Parliament noted the arrest and charging of 
Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire in these terms:10

“the circumstances appear to have parallels with the Section 55 offence and to reinforce 
the evidence gathered during Operation Motorman”.

In  terms  of  pure  personal  information,  the  parallels  between  phone  hacking  and  the 
Motorman activities are very clear. Shorn of the labels provided by the criminal law, both 
come  down  to  the  press  employing  unscrupulous  external  agents  to  obtain  confidential 
personal information about other people. Further, that information is provided without their 
knowledge or consent and obtained by unlawful means whether by deceit, corruption, or the 
exploitation of technology. In respect of any individual piece of information, the journalists 
may or may not have had good reasons or formal defences for doing so. But prima facie these 
were the sort of invasive practices from which  the data protection regime (along  with its 
principles and rights) was designed to protect people. 

5.2 

There were on the face of it two reasons why the ICO might have taken a keen interest in the 
Goodman/Mulcaire developments In the first place, there was the indication that even in the 
post-Motorman environment, sections of the press were still involved in the unlawful trade 
in personal information. This was a clear warning signal in its own right that all might not be 
well in the approach and practice of the press regarding personal information, and raised a 
question mark against the efficacy of the strategy of the ICO for responding to Motorman. 

5.3 

In the second place, there was the concern whether there could be any direct relationship 
between  Motorman  and  Goodman/Mulcaire.  This  was  the  question  which  had  occurred 
to Mr Owens:11 was it possible that the private phone numbers obtained by the press via

1059

Chapter 4 | The ICO and the Press todayHMr  Whittamore  (not  just  the  ex-directory  numbers  of  the  ‘targets’  but  the  multiplicity  of 
‘friends and family’ numbers), had been used to hack their phones? Were these precisely the 
private lines most likely to have been used by the ‘targets’ for the purposes of confidential 
conversations, texts or voicemails? Mr Owens told the Inquiry that he took these questions 
and thoughts to Nick Davies of the Guardian. He also told the Inquiry that there seemed to 
be  considerable  overlap  between  the  target  names  in  the  Motorman  material  and  in  the 
Mulcaire material.

5.4 

If the connection was made in the mind of the ICO, whether at either the general or the 
specific levels, the Inquiry had no evidence of it beyond the reference in What Price Privacy 
Now? Mr Thomas told the Inquiry, somewhat obliquely, that notwithstanding the connection 
made in its own report, the ICO thought that “the Goodman-Mulcaire case appeared to be a 
completely separate group”.12 For his part, Mr Graham maintained in his evidence to the Inquiry 
the position he had taken in front of the Select Committee two years previously, namely that 
hacking and blagging were separate activities and that the ICO had no formal role in relation 
to the former because it had no prosecution or criminal investigation powers in relation to 
hacking, which was a police matter.13 He had put it bluntly to the Select Committee:14

“We were not involved, so far as I know and I cannot think of any reason why we would 
be, in the most recent PCC investigation which was into the Goodman case which, I will 
repeat, was about hacking and not about blagging, so I would have been surprised if 
they had come to us and, if they had, I would have had to say, ‘Can’t help you, chum’.”

5.5 

Counsel to the Inquiry pressed Mr Graham on the broader question; the newspaper industry 
had  claimed,  and  the  ICO  appear  to  have  accepted  that  claim,  that  after  the  ICO’s  2006 
reports, it had cleaned up its act. How could we know that was true, given that we did know 
it hadn’t cleaned up its act in relation to phone hacking? Mr Graham’s answer was that they 
were different things.

The ICO’s current stance

5.6  Mr Graham’s position that the ICO had no particular reason to take an interest in the press 
was challenged in the course of his oral evidence to the Inquiry. His response was that it was 
a matter for the politicians, the PCC or indeed for the Inquiry itself to find out whether there 
was a problem with the press’ approach to personal information.15 Furthermore, the ICO had 
many other current priorities.16

5.7  Mr Graham explained that he had no present intention of using his powers, or taking any 
other step formally or informally, to consider the culture, practices and ethics of the press in 
relation to personal information. Put to him that he had positive responsibilities to promote 
compliance and good practice, that he had appropriate investigatory powers to take proactive 
steps to consider the position of the press in this regard, and that it would not on the face of it 
involve any great exercise to do so, he remained clear that he had other competing demands

on his time. He did conclude, however, that should the Inquiry recommend that he consider 
deploying his resources in this way, that view would be something the ICO would have to take 
very seriously.17 I return to this.

As  an  independent  statutory  regulator,  the  ICO  has  a  prerogative  to  set  its  own  priorities 
within the overall scheme of the powers and duties entrusted to it by Parliament. For the 
behaviour of the press to have no part in those priorities is not, on the face of it however, easy 
to understand. The ICO was created to have custody of the issue of the law and practice of 
information privacy as articulated in the data protection regime. This Inquiry was established 
to address arguably the greatest crisis in public confidence in information privacy since the 
creation of the data protection regime. A great deal of the evidence received by the Inquiry 
about press misconduct related to personal information privacy (including inaccuracy). The 
persistence of the ICO, even in the face of the commissioning of the Inquiry and the evidence 
received by it, in seeking to recuse itself from any proactive engagement in addressing the 
crisis in public confidence was troubling. Even allowing for the inevitably particular perspective 
that the Inquiry has, I do not find it easy to accept the proposition that the lack of priority 
which the ICO accorded to the press issue is obviously reconcilable with its overall public 
responsibilities.

5.9 

Before reaching a final conclusion on that point, however, it is necessary to reflect on whether 
there were in fact other, possibly structural, explanations for its unwillingness to put itself 
forward as a significant part of the answer to the concerns before the Inquiry.

Chapter 4 | The ICO and the Press todayHChapter 5 
Issues about the LegaL Framework

1.  the current views of the ICo
1.1 

The account that Mr Graham himself provided of the role, functions and powers of the ICO 
drew attention to the way in which they had more recently developed:1

“The  Information  Commissioner’s  role  in  regulating  the  use  of  personal  data  has 
evolved over the years. The role was originally  intended primarily as an educator, 
ensuring  data  protection  compliance  by  promoting  good  practice.  Significant 
enforcement  powers  of  the  Commissioner,  such  as  civil  monetary  penalties,  have 
been introduced by amendment over the last few years, partly in response to high 
profile data losses. Section 51 [of the Data Protection Act 1998] sets out the general 
functions  of  the  Information  Commissioner.  These  are  generally  about  promoting 
good  practice  rather  than  punishing  poor  practice.  This  educator  function  is  still 
central to how I approach my role as Information Commissioner.” 

1.2 

The power to impose civil monetary penalties of up to half a million pounds was introduced 
in April 2010. Mr Graham described it as:2 

“beginning to have a very salutary effect, both on public authorities and on commercial 
companies. They realise that the Information Commissioner has teeth.”

1.3 

1.4 

He also explained his view that the way in which the Data Protection Act (DPA) bore on the 
press was complex; it was not easy to explain in clear and simple terms to individuals what their 
rights were, what the role of the ICO was in enforcing those rights, and what its relationship 
was to other organisations with functions in the area of law enforcement and good practice. 
This, in his view, meant that individuals sometimes expected more of the DPA than it was 
capable of doing in this area.3 That might be thought likely to suggest two consequences in 
particular. These are an increased emphasis on the explanatory and educational role of the 
ICO which Mr Graham had previously emphasised, and an increased burden on the ICO itself 
to give a clear lead in relation to compliance and good practice by the press, since individuals 
were evidently relatively less well placed to proactively enforce their own rights.

The conclusion reached by Mr Graham was different. He put it that, had Parliament intended 
to give the Information Commissioner a significant role in overseeing the use of personal 
information for journalistic purposes, “it would have provided him with a very different and 
much simpler legal framework within which to do so”.4 He was clear that the ICO was never 
intended to play a major role in the regulation of the press and that while the data protection 
regime was designed to protect information privacy it was not intended to impinge on the 
use  of  personal  information  for  the  purposes  of  journalism.  The  enforcement  role  of  the 
ICO in this context was intended to be very limited; there was to be no challenge available

on data protection grounds to the use of personal information for journalism, and certainly 
none prior to publication. The principal effect of the DPA on journalism therefore was in the 
application of the criminal offence created by s55.5

However, Mr Graham’s more detailed consideration of the scheme of the DPA in relation to 
the press necessarily qualifies that very general proposition.6 In this, he set out the significant 
restrictions placed by the exemption provisions of s32 on the enforcement powers of the ICO 
in relation to journalists’ use of private information, concluding that therefore the Act largely 
leaves it to individuals to pursue court action after publication if they want to assert their 
rights: this is, of course, a problem if the legislation makes it hard for them to understand 
what those rights are.

He also drew attention to the fact that the exemption is made to turn on the reasonable belief 
of the journalist that publication would be in the public interest. In considering whether a 
journalist’s belief about the public interest is reasonable, the DPA provides that regard may 
be had to his or her compliance with any relevant Code which has been designated for that 
purpose by the Secretary of State: the Codes so far designated are the PCC Editors’ Code, the 
Ofcom Broadcasting Code and the BBC Producers’ Guidelines.

1.7 

It was Mr Graham’s view that the role given to journalists’ reasonable belief in the public 
interest meant that:7 

“it is not the Information Commissioner’s judgment about where the public interest 
lies or whether the provisions of the Act are compatible with journalism that counts 
and he has limited power to investigate or challenge the [journalist] data controller’s 
opinion.”

1.8 

He  did  accept,  however,  that  the  Information  Commissioner  has  powers,  albeit  ‘specific 
and limited’, to challenge whether the press exemption is being properly relied on. They are 
specific and limited because the DPA inserts a lot of procedural hurdles to their use, including 
the restriction that action cannot generally be taken unless the ICO is invited to do so by an 
individual or a court (irrespective of the fact that individuals may not be well-placed to issue 
such an invitation). But the powers do confer a function on the ICO of, in effect, policing the 
boundary between proper and improper claims on the journalism exemption:8

investigative  and  enforcement  powers  at  the 

“In  essence  the 
Information 
Commissioner’s disposal exist to enable me to ascertain whether personal data are 
being processed for purposes other than journalism and to act in relation to those 
other purposes, rather than enabling me to regulate the actual processing of personal 
data for journalistic purposes.” 

1.9 

To the extent, therefore, that there is any issue that journalists were, for example, seeking 
and using personal information for a range of unethical purposes other than with a view to 
publication, a regulatory question does arise. An example might be to threaten publication for 
collateral purposes or otherwise to put pressure on individuals to act or refrain from acting 
in certain ways. That, he recognised, would be expected directly to engage the functions of 
the ICO.

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH1.10  Mr Graham also acknowledged that ss32 and 55 did not exhaust the application of the DPA 
to the press. Quite apart from specific provisions (for example, the express provision that 
individuals have enhanced rights to damages for breaches of the legal requirements of the 
regime by the press),9 the general duty of the ICO to promote compliance and good practice 
applies in relation to the press. About that general duty, Mr Graham observed:10

“I also have a duty under section 51 of the Act to issue guidance and promote good 
practice. This duty is not specific to the press, journalism or other special purposes. I 
am aware that during my predecessor’s time in office significant efforts were made 
to provide advice to the PCC in relation to guidance we were encouraging the PCC to 
produce for journalists, focusing on the section 55 offence. So far as I am aware, the 
PCC did not go any further than producing general, high level guidance on journalism 
and the Act at the time and we have not received any further approaches to discuss 
such guidance during my time in office.”

Of course, the general duty to promote compliance and good practice, and the power to 
issue guidance, is free-standing and not dependent on the receipt of an approach.

1.11  Mr  Graham’s  perspective  on  the  role  of  the  ICO  in  relation  to  the  press  also  included  an 
important  acknowledgement  that  the  correct  approach  to  its  more  specific  regulatory 
functions had to be on a case by case basis and not on the basis of generalised assumptions 
about the exclusion of journalism from the purview of the regime. What Mr Graham said in 
this respect is set out in full here because I am content to adopt it for the purposes of this 
Report as an accurate and succinct summary of the legal and practical position, and one on 
the basis of which the outstanding questions about the detail of the regime in its application 
to the press should be considered:11

“The  fact  that  there  is  a  public  interest  in  a  free  press  being  able  to  go  about  its 
business is reflected in the treatment of the “special purposes” under the Act. However, 
it cannot be the case that any and every activity carried out in the name of journalism 
should be regarded as exempt from the provisions of the Act. Indeed, I do not believe 
that that extreme position is seriously advanced by any significant strand of opinion 
within the journalistic profession. There will, in certain circumstances, always need to 
be a judgment around the public interest in particular stories. This point is explicitly 
provided  for  in  the  various  journalistic  codes,  for  example  the  PCC  Editors’  Code, 
Ofcom Code, BBC Producers’ Guidelines, and so on. This is also the position reflected 
in the recitals to the Directive itself. The balance to be struck between Article 8 and 
Article 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998 has to be considered on a case by case basis. 
The inevitable tension between “the right to privacy” and “freedom of expression” 
demands that the issues at stake in each situation are properly evaluated. I observe 
in passing that making judgments on where the balance of the public interest lies on 
the facts of each case is something that the information Commissioner is called upon 
to do under both the Act and the FOIA.”

1.12  The last point is particularly significant. Although it is the journalist’s honest belief that he 
or she is working towards a publication in the public interest that counts, a challenge as to 
whether that belief is a reasonable one in all the circumstances is a matter for the Information 
Commissioner  to  consider  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  and  a  matter  on  which  the  ICO  has  a 
general measure of experience and expertise.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH1.13 

In my judgment, on the face of it, a combination of this kind of case by case approach to the 
ICO’s law enforcement function in relation to the press, and the application to the press of 
the ICO’s general duties to promote compliance and good practice, do add up to a significant 
potential role in guaranteeing public confidence in the culture, practices and ethics of the 
press  in  relation  to  personal  information.  However,  the  Inquiry  saw  little  evidence  of  the 
realisation of that potential, or, in practice, of that role having been fulfilled. It was particularly 
hard to reconcile this potential with Mr Graham’s resistance to the suggestion that the ICO 
should be actively making a connection between its role and functions and the activities of 
the press in relation to personal information privacy.

1.14 

In looking for any possible explanation for that within the legal framework itself, the question 
which  has  to  be  considered  is  whether  there  are  features  of  the  current  data  protection 
regime  in  relation  to  the  press  (including  perhaps  the  needless  complexity  cited  by  the 
Information Commissioner himself) which were themselves inhibiting that role and which 
are capable of improvement.

2.	 A	different	perspective	on	the	legal	framework
2.1 

The Inquiry was greatly assisted by the evidence of Philip Coppel QC who reflected on the 
history and substance of the provisions of the DPA with a particular bearing on journalism.12 By 
way of introduction, Mr Coppel pointed out that the predecessor legislation to the DPA, that 
is to say the Data Protection Act 1984 (which was not the product of a European Directive), 
had no exemption provisions for the press equivalent to those in the modern legislation. It 
was the EU Data Protection Directive of 199513 which required Member States to introduce 
measures into domestic law to:

“provide for exemptions or derogations … for processing personal data carried out 
solely  for  journalistic  purposes  only  if  they  are  necessary  to  reconcile  the  right  to 
privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression” 

2.2 

As Mr Coppel explained, in this way the Directive itself represents the balance that has been 
struck in relation to personal information privacy, between the individual right to privacy and 
the individual right to freedom of expression found, respectively, in Article 8 and Article 10 
of the European Convention on Human Rights (now incorporated into UK law by the Human 
Rights Act 1998).

2.3  Mr Coppel explained that the Data Protection Act 1998 in turn gives effect to the required 

balance in three main ways:14

“(1) Through the s32 exemption. This relieves a data controller from all obligations 
under the DPA to an individual (and correspondingly removes protection conferred 
by the DPA on an individual – §§37-45 above) where the data controller is processing 
that individual’s data only for purposes of journalism, for artistic purposes or for 
literary purposes, and then only provided that three conditions are satisfied.”

without reproducing it in full here, his general introduction to the history and substance of the Act is a commendably 
lucid and concise overview which should recommend itself to the general reader and which I am pleased to be able to 
adopt for the purposes of this Report: see pp2-12. This was also covered in his oral evidence: pp1-20, Philip Coppel,

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH“The  three  conditions  that  must  be  satisfied  in  order  for  personal  information 
processed for the special purposes to enjoy the s 32 exemption are:
i. 

the processing is being undertaken with a view to the publication by any person 
of journalistic, literary or artistic material;
  the  data  controller  reasonably  believes  that,  having  regard  to  the  special 
importance of the public interest in freedom of expression, publication would 
be in the public interest; and

ii. 

iii.   the data controller reasonably believes that, in all the circumstances, compliance 

with the data subject’s rights is incompatible with the special purposes.”

“(2) By the procedural relief conferred by s 32(4)-(5). Proceedings against a data 
controller must be stayed where the data controller claims that the data are being 
processed only for the special purposes and with a view to publishing by any person 
of journalistic etc material. The stay remains in place until the Commissioner has 
made a determination under s 45 that the data is not being so processed.
“(3) By creating a special enforcement regime (see §§54-55 above), which largely 
displaces the ordinary enforcement regime.”

Civil law enforcement: the exemptions in s32 of the Data Protection Act

Legal analysis and suggestions for reform

2.4 

The first thing to note about s32, as Mr Coppel explained, is the extent to which it disapplies 
the protection for individuals which is effected by the Act itself.15 Mr Coppel’s analysis of s32 
began by highlighting the notable features of the exemption:16

“(1)  It  exempts  the  data  controller  from  compliance  with  the  great  majority  of 
obligations under the DPA owed to a data subject …, rather than just the limited 
group  of  obligations  termed  “the  subject  information  provisions”  or  “the  non-
disclosure provisions”. This includes compliance with the data protection principles.
“(2) The processing by the data controller must be both:
– “only for the special purposes”; and
– with a view to the publication by any person (i.e. not just the data controller) 
of any journalistic, literary or artistic material (i.e. it need not be the data being 
processed nor need it be related to the data being processed).
“(3)  The  second  and  third  limbs  needed  to  engage  the  exemption  turn  on  the 
reasonable  belief  of  the  data  controller,  rather  than  on  fact.  The  only  matter 
identified by the section as inform that belief when assessing its reasonableness 
are various press codes of conduct, prepared by the press.”

2.5  Mr Coppel described the legislative and caselaw history of the s32 provision; this is important 

context and is therefore set out as follows in full:

1066

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH“The s 32 exemption originated as clause 31 in the Data Protection Bill. In giving 
the Bill its second reading speech in the House of Lords, Lord Williams of Mostyn 
recorded the paramountcy which the clause was intended to give to freedom of 
expression:

“The  Government  believe  that  both  privacy  and  freedom  of  expression 
are  important  rights  and  that  the  directive  is  not  intended  to  alter  the 
balance...”

This  view  was  endorsed  by  Lord  Wakeham,  chairman  of  the  Press  Complaints 
Commission, who commended the Bill for:

“...steer[ing] a sensible path which avoids the perils of a privacy law and 
achieves the crucial balancing act - of privacy and freedom of expression 
-  in  a  clever  and  constructive  way....The  Data  Protection  Bill  does  not 
introduce  a  back-door  privacy  regime.  The  Human  Rights  Bill  does.  The 
Data  Protection  Bill  safeguards  the  position  of  effective  self-regulation. 
The Human Rights Bill may end up undermining it.”

The Solicitor-General (Lord Falconer of Thoroton) then endorsed Lord Wakeham’s 
view:

“No  one  could  have  expressed  the  arguments  in  favour  [of  cl  31]  more 
eloquently.”

“Disquiet was expressed in the House by others:
– that, as a result of cl 31, the Bill failed to protect privacy,
– that cl 31 was too wide and significantly undermined the function of 
the legislation, and
– that the notion of the public interest was too wide and vague a basis 
upon which to disapply the protection conferred by the Bill.
Amendments  were  unsuccessfully  introduced  to  address  these  misgivings.  In 
supporting  the  amendments,  Lord  Lester  of  Herne  Hill  warned  at  length  that, 
as  drafted  and  because  of  cl  31,  the  DPA  failed  to  implement  the  Directive  and 
authorised interference by the press with the right to privacy in breach of Art 8 of 
the ECHR.
“The authorities
“Judicial pronouncements have acknowledged that the DPA is concerned with the 
protection of an individual’s ECHR rights to privacy.
“The  principal  judicial  authority  on  the  s  32  exemption  is  the  Court  of  Appeal’s 
judgment in Campbell v MGN Ltd. The claimant had claimed against a newspaper 
for its having published articles which disclosed details of the therapy the claimant 
was receiving for her drug addiction. These included covertly taken photographs of 
her leaving a therapy group meeting. The claimant alleged that these amounted 
to a breach of confidence (based on her right to privacy under ECHR arts 8 and 10) 
and a breach of the data protection principles (entitling her to claim a breach of the 
s 4(4) DPA statutory duty).
“In  the  High  Court,  judgment  was  entered  for  the  claimant  on  both  claims.  In 
relation to the DPA claim, the newspaper agreed that publishing the articles it had 
processed sensitive personal data relating to the claimant. The court held: –

1067

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHthat the published information (i.e. the nature and details of her therapy) constituted 
sensitive personal data relating to the claimant; 
that that was not lawful since it constituted a breach of confidence; 
that that processing was not fair as the information was acquired surreptitiously; 
that that processing did not satisfy any of the conditions in Schedule 2;
that that processing did not satisfy any of the conditions in Schedule 3; and
that the exemption in s 32 only applied to processing out “with a view to publication” 
and not to the processing involved in the publication itself.
The court assessed damages at £2,500 and aggravated damages at £1,000.
“The Court of Appeal allowed the newspaper’s appeal on both the confidentiality 
claim and the DPA claim. The Court of Appeal accepted that “processing” included 
publication  in  print.  However,  the  Court,  reversing  the  High  Court,  extended 
the  duration  of  s  32  exemption  to  cover  processing  on  and  after  publication. 
This division between processing before and after publication had limited s 32’s 
disapplication of the DPA’s protection up until, but not including, the most invasive 
activity - publication. In construing the section to give press freedom paramountcy 
throughout  and  with  no  opportunity  to  balance  the  individual’s  interest  in 
maintaining privacy, the judgment renders the DPA unlikely to be compliant with 
the Directive.
“The  claimant  appealed  to  the  House  of  Lords.  The  claimant  put  the  breach  of 
confidence claim at the forefront of the appeal, with the parties agreeing that the 
DPA claim “stands or falls with the outcome of the main claim” and that it “add[ed] 
nothing to the claim for breach of confidence.” In this way, protection of privacy in 
personal information came to be secured through the adaptation of the action for 
breach of confidence. In so doing, the House of Lords absorbed into the action the 
competition between freedom of expression as protected by Art 10 and respect for 
an individual’s privacy as protected by Art 8 – the very balancing exercise which the 
Directive articulates and which the DPA is supposed to implement.
“On one analysis, the House of Lord’s judgment appears to leave untouched the 
Court of Appeal’s treatment of the DPA. This would be unfortunate. The misgivings 
which had been expressed in Parliament during the passage of the Bill (see above) 
materialised  with  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  judgment.  The  better  analysis  is  that, 
given the parties’ agreement that the DPA claim stood or fell with the breach of 
confidence claim, the latter’s success means that the DPA claim enjoyed equal, if 
unspoken, success in the House of Lords.
“Personal privacy protection since Campbell v MGN
“The  practical  effect  of  the  Campbell  litigation  has  been  that  breach  of  privacy 
claims are now principally brought under the HRA, rather than under the DPA. This 
is borne out by the treatment of privacy in the main media law practitioner text, 
which recognises that the DPA:

“contains  the  most  comprehensive  privacy  provisions  now  affecting  the 
media”

but  goes  on  to  comment  that  “misuse  of  private  information”  (i.e.  the  evolved 
breach of confidence action):

“...will be of most relevance in the majority of privacy cases involving the 
media”

1068

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHand that:

“..the  other  [action],  much  less  significant  in  practice,  is  reliance  on 
statutory rights such as those afforded by the Data Protection Act 1998.”

The explanation offered for this is that:

“Data protection law is technical and unfamiliar to most judges. Claims under this 
legislation will rarely offer tangible advantages over a claim for breach of confidence 
or misuse of private information. Given the paucity of current authority on how the 
Data Protection Act 1998 is to be interpreted and applied, applications for summary 
judgment on such claims are ’for the moment at least, unlikely to find favour.”
“Given that the stated objective of the Directive was to protect personal privacy in 
information in a way which reconciled Arts 8 and 10 of the ECHR, this practical result 
suggests a shortfall in the implementation of the Directive.”

2.6  Mr Coppel concluded by summarising the current position with the following propositions:17

(a) “The  DPA  provides  a  code  to  protect  the  privacy  of  an  individual’s  personal 

information, in whatever form recorded other than in ad hoc manual records.

(b) The protection required by the Directive and provided by the DPA begins from 
the moment a person handling personal information acquires it and only ends 
once that person no longer holds it.

(c)  The Directive – to which the DPA is intended to give effect – permits Member 
States to relieve the press of obligations otherwise applicable to the processing 
of personal information where that it required to reconcile the ECHR right of 
privacy with the ECHR right to freedom of expression.

(d) Freed of judge-made authority, the DPA provides an individual with a measure of 
protection against press invasions of personal information privacy, but, because 
the s 32 exemption does not provide for any balancing of the fundamental right 
to privacy against the fundamental right to freedom of expression, the measure 
of protection is less than that provided under Art 8 of the ECHR.

(e) The DPA, in articulating:

i. 
ii. 
iii. 

iv. 
 

  degrees of sensitivity of personal information;
  the uses of that information against which protection is provided;
  the purposes for which those uses will be relieved of obligations securing 
the protection,
  and in adjusting the protection according the sensitivity of the information, 
offers  a  sophistication  and  predictability  which  is  unmatched  by  the 
jurisprudence on ECHR-based privacy claims.

(f)  In  reported  practice,  press  invasions  of  an  individual’s  personal  information 

privacy have mostly been remedied through ECHR-based privacy claims.

(g) Judge-made law has substantially reduced the efficacy of the DPA as a means 
of remedying press invasions of an individual’s personal information privacy, 
possibly to the point that the DPA, so construed, no longer gives full effect to 
the Directive.”

1069

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH2.7 

The result, in Mr Coppel’s view, is that where journalism is concerned:18

“undoubtedly, once you’re in section 32 territory, then the protection which is given to 
an individual’s privacy almost entirely falls away. All you have to do is touch section 
32 in some way, shape or form and the contest which the Act is supposed to embody 
between the right of expression, freedom of [expression], and an individual’s personal 
privacy has all been tilted one way.”

2.8 

In other words, the journalist is made arbiter of the balance, and the balance in turn falls to 
be made on the basis of matters exclusively within the knowledge of the journalist, including 
matters inaccessible because of the extensive protection provided for journalists’ sources. He 
goes on to argue that s32:19

“does not recognise any right to privacy. It’s there, its sole objective is to cut away 
at the right of privacy, and at the end of it, certainly after the decisions of the court, 
there is nothing left of that right.”

2.9 

In practical terms, the argument goes, the approach of the courts to the substantive law, 
coupled with the procedural inhibitions provided in other parts of the DPA (considered below) 
together with the very low level of damages which the courts have awarded have, between 
them, atrophied the principles and individual rights in their practical application to the press.

2.10  As a matter of law, there is more than one way to reflect on the tenor of Mr Coppel’s arguments. 
Put at its highest, his case would be that on the current state of the UK authorities, s32 fails to 
implement the Directive from which it derives, and is inconsistent with the relevant parts of 
the ECHR to which it is intended to give effect, because the relationship between privacy and 
expression rights has got out of balance. A proper balance is a fundamental obligation. The 
UK is therefore positively required to change the law to restore the balance. That is indeed 
Mr Coppel’s own contention: that UK data protection law currently fails to implement our 
obligations, and that Lord Lester’s concerns had proved to be prescient.20

2.11  Without going so far as that, even if the current balance were within the spectrum permitted 
by our international obligations, the argument could be expressed in terms that it is at an 
extreme end of that spectrum, and the UK can as a matter of law, and should as a matter of 
policy, restore a more even-handed approach, not least given the asymmetry of risks and 
harms as between the individual and the press.

2.12  Put at its very lowest, the point could be made that the effect of the development of the 
case law has been to push personal privacy law in media cases out of the data protection 
regime and  into  the  more open  seas  of  the  Human  Rights  Act.  This  has  happened  for  no 
better reason than the slowness of the legal profession to assimilate data protection law and, 
in the case of the judiciary, its greater familiarity with (and, he suggests, perhaps a preference 
for) the latitude afforded by the human rights regime over the specificity of data protection.21 
But  this,  the  argument  goes,  is  undesirable  because  the  data  protection  regime  is  much 
more predictable, detailed and sophisticated in the way it protects and balances rights, and 
significantly reduces the risks, uncertainties and expense of litigation concomitant on more 
open-textured law dependent on a court’s discretion.22 Where the law has provided specific

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHanswers, the fine-nibbed pen should be grasped and not the broad brush. The balancing of 
competing  rights  in  a  free  democracy  is  a  highly  sophisticated  exercise;  appropriate  tools 
have been provided for the job and should be used.

2.13  Mr Coppel suggested that the opportunity should be taken to redraft s32 in order better to 
reflect the balance between freedom of expression and the protection of privacy envisaged 
both in the Directive and in the ECHR. He suggested two changes in particular. The first is to 
modify the test for reliance on s32 so that it will be available only where:

(a) “the acquisition or use of the information is necessary for publication rather 

than simply being in fact undertaken with a view to publication;

(b) “there is a reasonable belief that publication would be in the public interest, 
with no special weighting of the balance between the public interest in freedom 
of information and in privacy; and

(c)  “objectively,  that  the  likely  interference  with  privacy  is  outweighed  by  the 

public interest in freedom of information.”

2.14  The second change is to amend s32 so that it gives exemption from fewer rights and principles, 

and in particular no longer allows for exemption from:

(a) “the requirement to obtain and use information in accordance with statute 

law;

(b) “the requirement to obtain the information only for specific purposes and not 

to use it in any way incompatible with those purposes;

(c)  “the requirement for information to be accurate and up to date;
(d) “the rights of individuals under the Act; and
(e) “restrictions on exporting the information.”

2.15  Mr  Coppel  provided  the  Inquiry  with  an  illustrative  revised  version  of  s32  to  indicate  the 
sort of changes which would need to be made.23 I should make it clear at once that I do not 
express any view on the drafting suggestions that Mr Coppel makes, nor is it appropriate 
for this Report to frame recommendations in the form of draft legislation. For that reason, 
the Report’s consideration is strictly limited to the policy objectives underlying Mr Coppel’s 
suggestions which are not simply to be inferred from the drafting but as explained by Mr 
Coppel  in  his  evidence;  it  would  of  course  be  a  matter  for  Parliamentary  Counsel  in  due 
course to reflect on how any policy recommendations of this nature would best be captured 
in drafting terms.

2.16  Considered purely in terms of what it might be desirable to achieve in terms of outcomes by 
any changes in the law, the underlying rationale of Mr Coppel’s analysis and conclusions can 
be stated relatively simply. Firstly, it is to express more clearly the even-handed approach 
required by human rights law to the balance between individual civil liberties on the one hand, 
and the public interest in the liberties of the press on the other. Secondly, it is to improve the 
prospects of law enforcement and the restoration of that balance where the press goes too 
far in transgressing individual civil liberties.

2.17  The suggested reforms would seek to achieve these objectives by focusing the mind of the 
journalist much more explicitly on the balanced judgment he or she has to make in the first 
place, with a reminder that the journalist is not above the law, and cannot be the sole arbiter

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHin the end of whether the public has been well-served by his or her actions. In other words, 
the changes are designed to promote conscious awareness in journalism and accountability 
to the public. Furthermore, they are intended to do so without imposing any burdens on 
honest and reasonably conscientious journalism24 beyond what is practicable and workable 
as a matter of day to day practice. The question is whether these intentions, from which it is 
hard to dissent, were indeed likely to be achievable along the lines Mr Coppel was proposing.

News International’s objections to Mr Coppel’s proposals

2.18  News International (NI) made submissions to the Inquiry to the effect that what Mr Coppel 

suggested was misconceived.25 This part of the Report considers these objections in turn.

(a) The ‘fundamental objection’

2.19 

In the first place, NI raised what it described as a ‘fundamental objection’.26 This relates to the 
proposed narrowing of the exemption in s32 on the basis of its divergence from the broad 
interpretation given to s32 by the Court of Appeal in Campbell v MGN Ltd.27 It was further 
argued that the effect of Campbell is that the existing provisions of s32, provided they are 
widely interpreted, strike the appropriate balance between Article 8 and Article 10. 

2.20  As a matter of law, I do not see that this concern constitutes a ‘fundamental objection’ to 
the  policy.  Mr  Coppel’s  submission  is  precisely  that  Campbell,  in  its  interpretation  of  s32, 
unduly widened an already excessively wide s32 as enacted in the DPA 1998. His argument 
is that the current s32 is framed in a way that effectively means journalism nearly always 
trumps privacy and therefore fails properly to implement the Directive. On that basis, the 
narrowing of the s32 exemption is better understood as returning s32 to its intended remit. 
It is of course open to Parliament to amend the wording of the exemption in s32 irrespective 
of the terms of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Campbell, provided that any amended 
s32 does not conflict with the underlying Directive to which it is intended to give effect, nor 
is incompatible with Article 10 or other provisions of EU law. The issue is not whether the 
policy of the proposed amendments conflict with Campbell, but whether they are necessarily 
incompatible with Article 10. 

2.21 

It is not apparent to me that there is a necessary incompatibility, or that s32 as currently 
drafted is the least generous formulation from journalism’s point of view which is conceivably 
consistent  with  the  ECHR  if,  indeed,  it  is  consistent  at  all.  Article  10  is  a  qualified  right, 
inherently  requiring  a  balance  with  other  rights  (including  the  right  to  privacy).  I  do  not 
consider that Campbell can be read in the way that NI appears to contend, namely that a wide 
interpretation of s32 is necessarily required to give effect to Article 10 and that any narrowing 
of the scope of s32(1) is necessarily incompatible with Article 10. It must be remembered that 
the wide construction in Campbell concerned the temporal element of the exemption, i.e. 
whether it was confined to pre-publication activity or included publication itself. Campbell 
itself is entirely silent on the need to strike a balance between privacy and Article 10.

1072

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH(b) The objection to a necessity test

2.22 

It is argued by NI that the proposed replacement of the test of processing “undertaken with 
a view to publication”, with a test of processing “necessary for the publication” would be 
inconsistent  with  authority and  unworkable  in  practice.  NI makes the  point  that  it  is  self-
evident that for the s32 exemption to work it must cover, as it does at present, the processing 
of  information  which  a  journalist  or  editor  ultimately  decides  to  leave  out  of  a  published 
article.28 This point was, in fact, squarely addressed by Mr Coppel in oral evidence to the 
Inquiry.29 The exchange between Counsel to the Inquiry and Mr Coppel went like this:

Q.  “Can we just look at a paradigm case of investigative journalism, that there’s a 
lot of preparatory work … before publication. If the journalist can show that all the 
work is necessary for the publication, then he or she is protected both in relation to 
the preparatory work and to the publication itself.”
A.  “Correct.”
Q.  “Is that the correct analysis?”
A.  “It recognises that particularly for investigative journalism, in which there may be 
a long trail leading up to the publication itself – and some of those sub-trails may turn 
out to be fruitless in themselves but are nevertheless necessary in order to explore all 
the avenues to produce the article itself. That will be captured by my proposed 32(1) 
paragraph (a).”

2.23  The policy intention here would be to tighten the nexus, or causal link, which the legislation 
requires between the acquisition and handling of the personal information and the ultimate 
publication but certainly not to the (obviously unworkable) extent that the exemption would 
apply only to material actually published. The idea would be to protect bona fide research or 
investigatory work without which publication could not happen, and that would have to apply 
from the point of view of the work at the time and not with hindsight. But it would not protect 
dealing in personal information unless it was properly necessary for research and publication. 
I do not see that that policy aim is either legally repugnant or necessarily unachievable in law 
and practice. As currently drafted, s32 of the Act requires the Court (or Commissioner) to 
consider whether the processing is undertaken with a view to publication, and that requires 
the Court (or the Commissioner) to consider the link between the processing and its ultimate 
purpose and the publication. Exactly the same conceptual process would be required under 
Mr Coppel’s proposals, but more would be being asked of the journalist to demonstrate the 
necessary link.

(c) Replacing the requirement in s32(1)(b) to have particular regard to the ‘special 
importance of the public interest in the freedom of expression’ with a more neutral 
balance, and an explicit balancing test

2.24  The NI submission30 suggests that this would be inconsistent both with Article 10 and s12(4) 
of the Human Rights Act. Dealing with the latter point first, I do not think that there is any 
arguable technical inconsistency with s12(4), which is essentially a procedural mechanism,

2.26 

directing a court when proceedings before it concern journalistic material to have particular 
regard to the importance of freedom of expression. In the event that a DPA claim engaging 
s12(4) were before the court, it would operate as a free standing provision and there is no 
need for the further incorporation of an equivalent provision in s32 in order to give effect to it. 
Where there are no proceedings before a court, for example where a journalist is considering 
whether s32 is met, s12(4) has no direct application.

It may be asked whether the recognition given in s12(4) to the importance of freedom of 
expression is not a reflection of the more fundamental point in the NI submission, namely 
that  as  a  matter  of  ECHR  law  there  is  in  fact  special  importance  attached  to  freedom  of 
expression, and beyond that to a lack of constraint on journalism, to which the removal of the 
formulation in s32 is repugnant. Undoubtedly, there is a very special public interest in freedom 
of expression, as formulated in Article 10. But it certainly puts the argument very high to say 
that the existing language of s32 is a minimum imperative required by the ECHR. Indeed, as 
is apparent, during the passage of the Data Protection Bill, some anxiety was expressed by 
expert opinion in Parliament to the effect that the pull it exerted on the scales balancing the 
public interest in freedom of expression as against other public interests (including privacy) 
was itself not compatible with the language of the Convention.

I do not consider, as the NI submission seems to suggest, that the current drafting of s32 
can  be  held  up  as  the  only  and  immutable  expression  of  the  balance  between  personal 
information  privacy  and  the  value  in  a  free  society  of  journalistic  (or  artistic  or  literary) 
endeavour. An expression of that balance in UK data protection law, which occupies a more 
central zone of the margin of appreciation, and which is expressed in language more close 
to  that  of  Articles  8  and  10  themselves  and  which  encourages  those  exercising  precious 
freedoms to be mindful in doing so of other people’s precious freedoms is something which 
it seems to me to be both possible and desirable to achieve. None of the provisions of s32 at 
present contains any explicit recognition of the wider context of public interest within which 
journalism must fairly operate. Mr Coppel’s suggestion of introducing an explicit balancing 
test seems to me to be both truer to the letter and spirit of the Convention, and an important 
and necessary encouragement to mindfulness where journalism handles, as it often must, 
private information.

(d) Taking individual subject access rights out of the automatic exemption provision 

2.27  The NI submission describes this as “perhaps the most worrying of Mr Coppel’s proposals”.31 
The right of individuals to know what information is held about them is of course at the heart 
of the data protection regime, and a very fundamental privacy entitlement in its own right. 
But its application in the modern world of journalism would be a change of some significance, 
and it is right that the idea should be considered with great care. The NI submission makes 
a number of points about the idea, some of which certainly need to be taken very seriously. 

2.28 

It  is,  for  example,  argued  that  it  would  seriously  undermine  the  protection  of  sources. 
Journalists’ sources enjoy a considerable degree of legal protection, not least under Article 
10 of the Convention.32 Any change to that protection would have to be considered most 
carefully, and in its own right rather than simply as the by-product of another policy. Sources 
(although not in a way specifically addressed to journalism) are, however, given considerable 
general protection by the data protection regime. That is because where access to one’s own 
data would necessarily involve the disclosure of information about a third party (including a 

31  page 6-8, ibid
32  Appendix 4

1074

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHsource), the privacy entitlements of that third party have to be respected as well as one’s own. 
In conferring the right of access to one’s own information, s7 of the existing DPA, therefore, 
makes this further specific provision:

“(4)  Where  a  data  controller  cannot  comply  with  the  request  without  disclosing 
information relating to another individual who can be identified from that information, 
he is not obliged to comply with the request unless—

(a) the other individual has consented to the disclosure of the information to the 

person making the request, or

(b) it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with the request without the 

consent of the other individual.

(5)  In  subsection  (4)  the  reference  to  information  relating  to  another  individual 
includes a reference to information identifying that individual as the source of the 
information  sought  by  the  request;  and  that  subsection  is  not  to  be  construed  as 
excusing a data controller from communicating so much of the information sought 
by  the  request  as  can  be  communicated  without  disclosing  the  identity  of  the 
other individual concerned, whether by the omission of names or other identifying 
particulars or otherwise.
(6)  In determining for the purposes of subsection (4)(b) whether it is reasonable in 
all the circumstances to comply with the request without the consent of the other 
individual concerned, regard shall be had, in particular, to—

(a  any duty of confidentiality owed to the other individual,
(b) any steps taken by the data controller with a view to seeking the consent of 

the other individual,

(c)  whether the other individual is capable of giving consent, and
(d) any express refusal of consent by the other individual.”

2.29 

2.30 

It  is  an  important,  if  technical,  point  to  note  that  the  subject  access  right  is  a  compound 
right, including not just a right of access to the information, but a right to know whether 
information is held at all about one. So if even to confirm whether information is held would 
disclose a source, s7 makes provision for an answer which will neither confirm nor deny it. 

I do not express a concluded view as to whether the existing provisions of the DPA are a 
complete  answer  to  the  challenge  that  introducing  at  least  the  possibility  of  a  right  of 
subject access has to be reconciled with the need to protect journalists’ sources. I simply 
observe that it is not apparent to me that the importance of protecting journalists’ sources 
cannot be captured in suitable amendment to these provisions, should any be needed. The 
more fundamental point is that there does not seem to me to be an argument from first 
principles  that  the  protection  of  journalists’  sources  necessitates  a  complete  and  blanket 
dis-application of the subject access right in all circumstances. And if it is not necessary to 
disapply a fundamental privacy right in all circumstances, it is necessary not to.

2.31 

It is further argued by NI that there are other reasons why it would be necessary to take a 
blanket approach to this right in the world of journalism. These are:

(a) “the need for legitimate investigative journalism to be able to operate covertly, 
and over a period of time, without the object of the investigations being able 
to find out that the press are interested in them;

1075

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH(b) “the burden on newspapers’ resources, particularly given the motivation of 

individuals to find out what is being held about them at regular intervals;

(c)  “‘it  would  spell  the  end  of  the  exclusive’  if  individuals  could  get  hold  of  a 
possible story and provide it on their own terms to another newspaper – or 
indeed take to the internet with their own pre-emptive version; and

(d) “that it fails to respect the balance required between Article 10 and 8 more 

generally.”

2.32  Care must be taken in this context to avoid rhetorical elision between matters of commercial 
convenience or profit, on the one hand, and a challenge to the current business model of the 
newspapers so fundamental as to amount to an abridgement of free speech, on the other. 
With the first of the four points noted above, it is possible to readily to agree. With the second 
and third, there are issues of degree. With the third in particular in relation to the question 
of exclusive stories, the business model may well be under rather more acute threat from the 
internet generally and the highly ephemeral nature of exclusivity once any publication takes 
place, than from any legislative change relating to the entitlement of individuals  to know 
whether information is held about them. Similarly, the issue is to a degree less concerned with 
the exercise of freedom of expression than with the abridgement of the rights of others to 
receive and impart information. In reality, the key question, therefore, is the fourth, of which 
the first is an aspect. Does a fair balance between Articles 10 and 8 prohibit any possibility of 
subject access to journalistic material in all circumstances?

2.33 

I am not persuaded that it does. It is evident that a fair balance would require an entitlement 
for  a  subject  access  request  to  be  refused  to  any  degree  where  to  comply  with  it  would 
compromise the protections envisaged by Article 10. But I am inclined to think that this could 
properly be done on a case by case basis rather than by wholesale ouster of the right. This 
point needs to be borne in mind: a significant aspect of the importance of the subject access 
right lies in the ability it gives individuals to test for themselves whether their information is 
being dealt with lawfully and in accordance with the data protection regime (including, of 
course, whether the information is accurate). That includes being able to test whether any 
exemptions are being properly claimed (although not to the extent that properly claimed 
exemptions are themselves thereby compromised). The complete exclusion of subject access 
from  all  journalistic  activity  removes  a  principal  check  on  its  lawfulness.  Who  then  is  to 
perform  that  function?  The  obvious  answer  would  be  the  Information  Commissioner,  but 
that answer in itself takes us to a second area which Mr Coppel has identified as problematic.

Civil law enforcement: journalism, access to justice and the 
powers of the Information Commissioner 

2.34  As well as the substantive exemptions provided by s32, the DPA creates a number of special 
procedural provisions which apply whenever it is claimed that personal information is being 
acquired or used for journalism. Their effects are both very significant for the purposes of the 
Inquiry and also very complicated. Their very complexity adds to their impact. It is necessary 
to engage with and unravel the detail of these provisions in order properly to understand and 
address their effect.

1076

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH2.35  The relevant provisions are identified in this way by Mr Coppel:33

“Once  a  data  controller  claims  that  the  personal  data  are  being  processed  for  a 
“special purpose” (i.e. journalism, artistic or literary purposes) or with a view to the 
publication by any person of any journalistic, literary or artistic material:

(a) the  Commissioner  cannot  ordinarily  serve  an  enforcement  notice  or  an 

information notice (s 46); and

(b) where  a  person  has  brought  a  claim  under  the  DPA  seeking  a  remedy  for 
breach of any of the data subject’s rights (see §§37-45 above), the Court must 
stay the proceedings until there has been a determination under s 45 of the 
data controller’s claim (s 32(4)).

Where the proceedings are so stayed or the Commissioner has received a s 42 request 
for assessment, he may serve a “special information notice” (s 44). The object of the 
notice  is  to  enable  the  Commissioner  to  carry  out  the  s  45  determination.  A  data 
controller has a right of appeal against a special information notice (s 48).
“Under s 45(1), where it appears to the Commissioner that the personal data are 
not  being  processed  only  for  a  special  purpose  or  are  not  being  processed  with  a 
view to the publication by any person of any journalistic, literary or artistic material, 
the Commissioner may make a determination to that effect. A data controller has 
a  right  of  appeal  against  the  determination.  Once  the  determination  takes  effect, 
the  Commissioner  may  serve  an  information  notice.  And,  if  a  court  gives  leave, 
the  Commissioner  may  serve  an  enforcement  notice.  If  the  Commissioner  decides 
otherwise, proceedings for breach of the DPA may be stayed indefinitely…”

2.36  Broadly speaking then, the Information Commissioner cannot exercise his regulatory powers 
in relation to the press (and a court cannot decide an action brought by an individual for 
breach by the press of the rights contained within the data protection regime) unless the 
Information Commissioner has first made a formal determination that the newspaper is not, 
in relation to given personal information, using it wholly for the purposes of journalism. The 
only power he can use to help him make that determination is the power to issue a ‘special 
information notice’ for the purpose. And he cannot issue one of those unless either litigation 
is already on foot or he receives a specific request from a complainant. Where he does issue 
a  special  information  notice,  the  newspaper  can  appeal  it.  And  if  he  does  finally  make  a 
‘determination’ the newspaper can appeal that too. Any enforcement steps he is then able to 
take, whether investigative or compliance, each brings its own appeal rights.

2.37  Mr Coppel explained some of the cumulative practical impact of these provisions:34

“It results in a disapplication of the power to serve an enforcement notice – that’s the 
first important thing that it does – and then secondly, where an individual has brought 
a claim, a section 4(4) claim for breach of statutory duty through the DPA, then the 
court must stay those proceedings until there has been a determination under section 
45, and section 45 is a special procedure relating to the so-called special purposes, ie 
journalism, literature and art, to see whether in fact that is the case. 
“In practice, what happens is that it becomes so convoluted – the individual disgruntled 
has commenced proceedings under section 4(4). If they – if the point is taken that

1077

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHthese are special purposes, then a satellite set of proceedings is effectively launched, 
namely the section 45 one. That, if one ever gets to the end of it, reaches its end, 
it might come up with a conclusion. If the conclusion is in favour of the individual, 
then they resume their claim, by which time, of course, matters have marched on 
significantly and it may be of cold comfort, any such relief – [they may quite possibly 
have lost interest in living by then] and particularly if one realises that at the end of 
it all one is going to get like, for example, Catherine Zeta Jones, £50, one can well 
understand why interest might be a little bit diminished.”

2.38  During the course of the Inquiry, it has frequently been asserted that most or all of the evident 
problems with the culture, practices and ethics of the press would be solved if the existing 
law were to be properly enforced. Where press compliance with the legal requirements of 
the data protection regime is concerned, enforcing the civil law is a two-stage process. It 
must  first  ensure  that  the  boundary  between  exempt  and  non-exempt  activity  in  relation 
to  dealings  in  personal  information  is  properly  observed  by  the  press,  and  this  is  a  point 
which applies wherever that boundary is drawn by the substantive law. Secondly, it must also 
ensure proper compliance with the regime where exemptions do not apply.

2.39  Law enforcement in these respects takes place in two different ways. First, it is by individuals 
bringing cases in the courts, and, secondly, by the exercise of his powers by the Information 
Commissioner.  Both  as  regards  litigation  procedure  on  the  one  hand  and  as  regards  the 
assertion  of  the  powers  of  public  authorities  on  the  other,  there  are  already  significant 
inhibitions  in  the  general  law  which  impact  on  the  possibility  of  proper  law  enforcement 
in  respect  of  the  press  because  of  the  balance  which  must  be  struck  between  the  public 
interest in law enforcement and the public interest in the protection of journalists’ sources. 
The additional procedural thicket which the DPA erects in the way of anyone attempting to 
find out whether the press is complying with the law, that is to say whether their activities 
are genuinely covered by exemptions and if not whether they are complying with what is 
legally required of them, is for practical purposes near-insuperable. The press, so this analysis 
goes, is effectively beyond the reach of law enforcement. In that regard, the legal regime 
can be and is disregarded for any practical purposes. Whether what the press are doing with 
people’s  information  is  or  is  not  specifically  exempted  from  the  regime  hardly  matters  in 
practice since the question is effectively prevented from arising.

2.40  Mr Coppel suggested that this aspect of the problem should be addressed in two ways, that is 
to say by removing the elaborate tangle of red tape which stops the Information Commissioner 
doing his job in relation to the press, and by providing more straightforward access to justice 
for individuals.

Powers of the Information Commissioner

2.41  Here, Mr Coppel’s proposal is very straightforward: the DPA should be amended to repeal the 
entirety of the complex special regime limiting the Information Commissioner’s powers in 
relation to the press. Specifically, he recommends:35

“removing  the  provisions  for  special  information  notices  (s  44),  special  purpose 
determinations (s 45) and special purposes restrictions (s 46), thereby aligning the 
DPA’s enforcement procedures as they apply to the press with those that apply to 
others,  i.e.  the  ordinary  provisions  for  enforcement  (s  40),  assessment  (s  42)  and 
information notices (s 43)”.

pdf

1078

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH2.42  These provisions of the DPA are highly redolent of a policy context in which the self-interest 
of the press was a powerful advocate, rather than one in which law enforcement was an 
active concern. Given the specificity and elaborate nature of the provision made for testing 
the compliance of the press with the law, however, this much can be said: it cannot have 
been the intention of the legislation that the compliance of the press with the law should, in 
reality, be incapable of being tested in practice. No doubt concerns were vocally expressed 
that legitimate journalism should be able to go about its business without interference or 
‘chill’ from overzealous regulators or nuisance litigation. But there is no policy intention on 
the face of the legislation that it should be impossible, in the usual ways, to establish whether 
the journalism was in fact legitimate in the first place. Such an intention would have been very 
simple to express legislatively although it would, of course, have been incompatible with the 
spirit and letter of the Directive. However wide the boundaries of an exemption are set, those 
boundaries have to be given some real meaning. Making those boundaries inaccessible, and 
the question on which side of them any activity falls effectively incapable of being answered, 
strips those boundaries of meaning.

2.43  The  risks  of  applying  the  ordinary  regime  of  information  and  enforcement  notices  to  the 
press are capable of being overstated. An information notice could not be issued unless the 
Commissioner reasonably required any information for the purposes of determining whether 
the press were complying with the law. Similarly, an enforcement notice could not be issued 
unless the Commissioner was satisfied that the press had contravened or was contravening 
the  law.  In  each  case,  the  Commissioner  would  have  to  bear  in  mind  any  genuine  risk  to 
freedom of expression. Each measure, if deployed, has an appeal mechanism through which 
its compatibility with freedom of expression could readily be tested, case by case. It is not 
my view that the mere existence of the possibility of law enforcement measures of this sort 
would itself be an improper inhibition to journalistic activity, nor that the press would be slow 
to understand and make use of the sort of procedural safeguards which the standard data 
protection regime provides. 

2.44  None of this is of course intended to give any encouragement to the idea of over-zealous 
reliance  by  the  ICO  on  formal  powers.  As  successive  Information  Commissioners  have 
repeatedly  emphasised,  in  general,  the  first  recourse  of  a  regulator  with  concerns  about 
compliance should always be to seek to resolve matters informally and cooperatively. But 
it  has  not  been  my  perspective  that  over-zealous  recourse  to  formal  powers  has  been  a 
major concern about the way in which the ICO has engaged with the press and there are, in 
any event, plenty of inhibitions in law and practice to any such tendency. On the contrary, 
it appears that the most pressing concern is the need to address the extent to which the 
ICO is shy about performing its proper role in relation to the press as a member of its field 
of  regulation,  not  least  by  addressing  the  evident  cultural  inhibitions  to  doing  so  created 
by  the  DPA’s  complicated  procedural  regime.  If  the  ICO  has  entertained  a  view  that  it  is 
somehow unable to apply the law to the press, that it is not really supposed to do so, the 
process provisions are likely to have been a significant encouragement to that view, however 
overstated that view may be.

2.45  From the point of view of legitimate journalism, it is right that the ICO should not interfere 
or over-regulate. It is also right that journalism should be judged primarily by what it prints 
rather than be held to account at the newsgathering stage. A theme of this part of the Report, 
however, is that this does not mean that blanket exclusion from regular law enforcement 
measures is the only, or a very sensible, response. It is my conclusion that it is a part of the 
culture, practices and ethics of some sections of the press that there is a sense of comparative 
impunity and, in the main, of being beyond the reach of the law. This has not been in the public 
interest, and needs to be rebalanced by a greater sense of awareness of the law and what is 

1079

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHthe continuum between the constraints of the law and aspiration towards good practice. The 
existing procedural provisions of the DPA in relation to the press appear to be an unnecessary 
and unwelcome inhibition to making progress towards that goal.

Access to justice

2.46 

2.47 

2.48 

In general, the DPA provides36 for individuals who suffer damage as a result of breach of the 
legal requirements of the regime to be entitled to financial compensation from the person or 
organisation responsible. It is a defence in such proceedings for the latter to show they had 
taken reasonable care to try to act in a way that is compliant with the law. If any individual 
has  suffered  damage,  compensation  is  also  payable  for  distress.  Where,  however,  the 
contravention relates to acquiring or using personal for the purposes of journalism, literature 
or  art,  compensation  is  payable  for  distress  alone,  without  the  need  to  prove  physical 
damage. This is in recognition of the fact that the unlawful widespread public dissemination 
of someone’s personal information is capable of having a distressing impact in its own right; 
this is the impact about which very many of the witnesses before the Inquiry have eloquently 
spoken.

In  practice,  however,  the  way  that  the  courts  have  interpreted  this  entitlement  to 
compensation has been very limiting indeed. As a result, claims are rarely successful, and 
even when successful have resulted in very small awards.37 At its root the problem is that 
the courts have been reluctant to award compensation for anything other than measurable 
financial loss caused by the breach of the regime. Nothing, in other words, is awarded for 
the distress in its own right, but only if it has occasioned economic loss. But by its nature, 
the subject matter of the regime, that is to say privacy, is unlikely to produce circumstances 
in which breach straightforwardly causes pecuniary loss. The harm done is the invasion of 
privacy itself.38

In  other  areas  of  the  civil  law,  the  courts  have  solved  this  problem  by  evolving  a  tariff 
of  compensation  to  be  paid  for  non-pecuniary  loss.  The  best  example  is  in  relation  to 
compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenity in personal injury case. A more recent 
(and  perhaps  more  relevant)  illustration  is  the  award  of  damages  for  breach  of  contract 
where  holidaymakers  have  been  let  down  by  travel  companies  or  holiday  operators.  The 
whole point of the contract was the pleasure of a holiday with the result that compensation 
will be payable for the disappointment. 

2.49  On the face of it, the inability of victims of data protection breaches to obtain compensation 
for distress in its own right is an anomaly for a regime whose principal purpose is to safeguard 
individuals from unlawful intrusion into their private lives. The practical problem facing any 
attempt  to  address  that  lacuna,  however,  would  be  how  to  put  a  price  on  privacy  in  the 
way that the courts have evolved tariffs of compensation in other areas of ‘immeasurable’ 
psychological or emotional harm. 

2.50 

It must immediately be acknowledged that this is an issue which is relevant to activities in 
relation to private information which go beyond journalism, and beyond public dissemination 
of information in breach of the data protection principles. Damages for non-pecuniary loss in

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHprivacy cases is a potentially large subject in its own right, and one which has an extremely 
large and detailed context in the law of damages more generally.39 On the other hand, as 
indicated above, the DPA makes special provision for compensation for distress unlawfully 
caused by the press although this is a provision to which the courts have not in practice given 
substantive effect. 

2.51  Mr  Coppel  tested  the  issue  with  the  example  of  the  medical  records  of  an  individual 
being published in a newspaper in breach of the DPA, that is to say, unfairly and without 
legitimate public interest justification.40 To that example might be added the example of the 
dissemination of intimate sexual details or nude photographs, again, for the purposes of the 
argument, unfairly and without legitimate public interest justification. Mr Coppel suggested: 
“That, it seems to me, is a fundamental breach of what the Act is there to protect”. Should 
the measure of recompense be simply how much money the individual may lose as a result 
– and if none, should the individual be left to endure any amount of distress and personal 
devastation uncompensated?

2.52  The  DPA  has  been  amended  in  recent  years  to  make  provision  for  the  Information 
Commissioner to be able to impose monetary penalties, including in cases of this sort.41 But 
monetary penalties of course, while they may have a deterrent or punitive effect, still leave 
the victim uncompensated.

2.53  Mr Coppel’s own suggested solution has two elements. First, the Information Commissioner 
should be empowered to set a tariff of financial solace for breaches of the data protection 
principles, referable to the duration, extent, gravity and profitability of their contravention, 
such  amounts  to  be  in  addition  to  amounts  for  damage  and  distress  resulting  from  the 
contravention and to be followed by the Commissioner and the Courts. Secondly, a wronged 
individual should be provided with the choice of an alternative system to claim the tariff only, 
with no provision for damages, legal costs or fees, such a system to be administered by the 
Information Commissioner.42

2.54  Within Mr Coppel’s analysis and conclusions, there are proposals that are specifically directed 
to the law relating to data protection; others have far wider ramifications into the law of 
damages. As for the proposed way forward in relation to the DPA, I accept that, at their heart, 
they reflect a recognition that changes need to be made in order to provide a response to 
the demand repeatedly expressed for the law to be properly enforced in relation to press 
misconduct and for individuals to have proper access to ways in which they can enforce their 
rights. 

2.55  More specifically, in relation to the ‘special enforcement regime’ provided in the 1998 Act 
in relation to the press, there are good grounds to conclude that it has had an unintended 
and damaging effect on the ability of the ICO to perform its functions. Exceptionally complex 
and  largely  unworkable  in  practice,  it  appears  to  have  had  a  chilling  effect  on  reasonable 
law enforcement and, equally, to have a high risk of impacting unfairly on individuals. In my 
judgment, Mr Coppel’s view is correct: its removal would promote the overall public interest 
and a balanced improvement in the culture, practices and ethics of the press in its approach 
to personal information.

39  This debate might be influenced by the level of damages being agreed in the phone hacking litigation being brought 
against News Group Newspapers Ltd in relation to the News of the World

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH2.56 

In reaching that conclusion, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that legitimate journalism 
is not unduly  impeded by attempts at pre-publication law enforcement on the one hand, 
albeit at the same time that individual liberties are not unduly stripped of their content by 
being rendered wholly unenforceable before publication (and then to be defeated by the act 
of publication) on the other. It is my provisional view that this difficult, but essential balance, 
is one which can and must be performed on a case by case basis by the ICO in considering 
the exercise of its powers, and that it is not one for which it is necessary or appropriate to 
attempt to make further provision by law. If, however, it were thought desirable to do so, it 
would perhaps be possible to preserve expressly in the Act the principle that, in considering 
the exercise of any powers in relation to the press or other publishers, the ICO should have 
special regard to the obligation in law to balance the public interest in freedom of expression 
alongside the public interest in upholding the data protection regime. 

2.57  Built into this balancing exercise should be a requirement on the ICO, when considering the 
exercise of any of its powers, to have regard to the fact of membership of an accredited press 
regulator by the relevant title: this should be capable of establishing the proposition that the 
title  subscribes  to  recognised  and  approved  standards  of  conduct  which  are,  themselves, 
enforceable.

2.58  The proposals for adjusting the boundaries and operation of the press exemption in s32 is 
a more difficult exercise. Although I am minded to the view that there is, indeed, an issue 
about compatibility, I do not consider that it is necessary for me to resolve whether there is 
any incompatibility between the provision as interpreted by UK courts and the UK’s European 
and international obligations. What I am, however, clear about is that there is room within 
the latitude afforded by those obligations for a fairer, more even-handed balance, and that 
improvement in that respect is, both as a matter of both law and policy, desirable.

2.59 

I therefore recommend that the policy represented by the suggested revisions to section 32 
of the DPA should be given effect to by suitable amendment to the Act. In doing so, I consider 
that particular attention should be addressed to one area where further refinement of that 
policy seems to me to be desirable.

2.60  The removal of the blanket exemption from the fundamental right of subject access currently 
provided by s32 seems to me to be right for the reasons considered above. But there are 
special considerations relating to the exercise of a right of this nature in relation to the press 
to which careful attention needs to be paid. It remains necessary for the right to be balanced 
against the special protections afforded by the law to journalists’ sources. That protection 
is not absolute as the law stands, but it is extensive. On the face of it, the existing general 
limitations on the subject access right which are designed to safeguard third party information 
do appear generally apt to follow the existing (important) protection for journalists’ sources. 
If it were thought that there was any doubt about the matter, however, that doubt should be 
resolved by a provision to the effect that the right of subject access is not intended to displace 
the general law on the inaccessibility of journalists’ sources.

2.61  Turning to the question of damages, I do not consider that it is appropriate for the Information 
Commissioner to be setting a tariff of financial solace for breaches of data protection or why 
this  should  be  different  from  damages  for  distress  (which  might  themselves  be  linked  to 
damages for breach of other privacy rights). The proper place for the assessment of damages 
(or non pecuniary compensation) is allied to the consideration of damages across this area of 
the law. I return to this topic when dealing with the civil law.43 

43  Part J, Chapter 3

1082

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH2.62 

In making these recommendations, I accept that the current state of the legal framework in 
relation to the ICO’s civil law enforcement powers goes some way to explain the indications 
of reluctance by the ICO to take an active, or any significant, interest in the formal exercise 
of  their  regulatory  functions  in  relation  to  the  press.  I  do  not,  however,  accept  that  as  a 
complete explanation. In reality, there is a lack of evidence that the ICO has, over the years:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

regarded the symptoms of deficiencies in the culture, practices and ethics of the press 
in relation to personal information as a serious operational priority;
shown a will to test in practice the powers and procedures conferred by law specifically 
for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the legal obligations of the regime by the 
press – however attenuated those obligations and however difficult those procedures; 
or
drawn attention politically to any perceived shortcomings in the legal framework in this 
respect.

This raises questions about a possibly deeper reluctance to accept an active role in relation 
to the press. Neither do I accept that other operational priorities must be accepted without 
more as an explanation for ICO inactivity in an area which the very existence of this Inquiry 
demonstrates to be a matter of acute public concern.

2.63  While recommending changes to the law, I do not intend to encourage the idea that the ICO 
should continue to take no steps to address the culture, practices and ethics of the press in 
the meantime. I therefore additionally recommend that the ICO should take immediate steps 
to prepare, adopt and publish a policy on the exercise of its formal regulatory functions in 
order to ensure that the press complies with the legal requirements of the data protection 
regime. I explain elsewhere, it is also my recommendation that in future such a policy should 
expressly provide that membership of an effective and independent self-organised system of 
standards regulation should be able to be taken into account by the ICO in contemplating the 
exercise of those functions. 

2.64 

I further recommend that the ICO take immediate steps to publish advice aimed at individuals 
concerned that they are or may have been victims of unlawful use of their personal information 
by the press. That might, for example, take the form suggested above, of enabling individuals, 
on application to the ICO, to obtain confirmation in so far as the office is able to offer it of 
whether they can be identified among the Motorman victims, and if so in relation to which 
title or titles, and to obtain assistance if necessary in making a suitable request to those titles. 
It might also take the form of engaging with victims’ representative organisations to those 
ends. 

2.65 

Promoting good practice: journalism and ss51-52 DPA 
In considering the role of the ICO in relation to the conduct of the press in connection with 
the handling of personal information, it is sensible to start with ss51-52 of the DPA.44 These 
are  among  the  simpler  and  more  straightforward  aspects  of  the  application  of  the  data 
protection regime to the press and it has not been suggested that the provisions should not 
be taken at other than face value. In short, they provide that:

(a) 

the ICO has a positive duty to promote the following of good practice in relation to the 
handling of personal information by the press, no less than in the case of any other 
business;

44  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/51; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/52

1083

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH(b) 

(c) 

(f) 

(e) 

(d) 

the ICO also has a positive duty to promote the observance of the legal requirements 
of the DPA by the press, in so far as they apply;
the powers of the ICO in relation to the dissemination of public information and industry 
guidance apply in the context of the press industry;
the powers of the ICO to encourage sections of industry to develop and apply codes of 
good practice in the handling of personal information apply to the press sector;
the  duty  of  the  ICO  to  make  an  annual  report  to  Parliament  on  the  exercise  of  its 
functions includes a power to cover press aspects in that report; and
the power of the ICO to make special reports to Parliament includes the ability to make 
special reports about the intersection between the data protection regime in practice, 
and the culture, practices and ethics of the press in relation to personal information 
(which provision provided the basis for the laying of the What Price Privacy? Reports).
2.66  As a matter of ordinary public law, the exercise of any of these powers has to be kept under 
review, considered within the overall framework and purposes of the data protection regime 
as a whole, and both reasonable and proportionate in all the circumstances. On the face of it, 
relevant considerations in that context would include matters such as the extent of objective 
evidence of poor practice along with the nature and seriousness of that poor practice and 
levels of public concern. Evidence of widespread ignorance of the requirements of law and 
good practice (whether on the part of industry or individual) would be particularly relevant, 
especially if that ignorance were related to the genuine complexity of those requirements. As 
an expert regulator, the ICO would then be in a unique position to address the problem with 
explanation, education and support.

2.67  Of course, the exercise of any of these powers in relation to the press would also have to take 
into account the wider legal context, including respecting in full the balance to be struck both 
in law and in policy between the liberties of the individual and the vital requirements of a 
free press. That wider context would certainly affect the manner in which the powers were 
exercised, and the content of any guidance, codes, reports and so on. But it does not on the 
face of it appear to constitute a limitation on the existence or potential value of these powers 
in relation to the press.

2.68  For  my  part,  I  do  not  see  any  defect  in  these  provisions  which  could  limit  their  ability  to 
contribute to the promotion of good standards of behaviour in the press in the handling of 
private  information:  none  has  been  overtly  suggested.  There  has  been  no  suggestion,  for 
example, that throughout the period in which Mr Thomas was trying to encourage the PCC to 
promote good practice in the industry, including by means of its own Codes and guidance, he 
was in any way inhibited as a matter of law by the legislation governing the ICO from acting 
in those areas or fulfilling those requirements himself.

2.69 

If there were any real doubt in the matter, legislation could put its application to the press 
beyond doubt. Indeed, it would also be possible to introduce new positive duties in relation 
to the press, for example to insert positive duties into the legislation as follows: 

(a) 

(b) 

into s1(3) for the ICO, in consultation with the industry and the public, to exercise the 
power to issue comprehensive guidance to the press on good practice in the handling 
of personal information;
into s51(2) to exercise the power to issue comprehensive guidance to the public on their 
individual rights in relation to the obtaining and use by the press of their information, 
and how to exercise them; and

1084

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH2.70 

2.71 

(c) 

into s52 to include in the ICO’s annual report to Parliament an account of its perspective 
on press compliance with law and good practice in the handling of personal information 
and to draw special attention to any concerns.

Having said that, I should make it clear that I do not see any reason to doubt that the ICO 
could exercise his powers in these ways as the law presently stands. 

I do not accept that there is any reason in law to explain the failure of the ICO to use these 
powers  by  taking  active  steps  to  address  the  need  for  improvement  in  the  standards  of 
the  practices  of  the  press  in  relation  to  the  handling  of  personal  information.  Successive 
Commissioners have emphasised that this drive for good practice function is the cornerstone 
of the entire regulatory regime. Unfortunately, evidence to justify serious concern about the 
standards of the press in this respect has been available and well publicised: an informed, 
well-targeted,  proactive  and  engaged  approach  to  the  problem  might  have  made  a  real 
difference. It is a matter of regret to record that the failure by the ICO to address this issue 
must be regarded as a regulatory opportunity missed.

In those circumstances, I recommend that, in discharge of its functions and duties to promote 
good practice in areas of public concern, the ICO should take immediate steps, in consultation 
with the press, to prepare and issue comprehensive good practice guidelines and advice. This 
should include the articulation of principles and standards dealing with the acquisition and 
use of personal information. I hope and anticipate that the press will actively cooperate in 
the preparation and implementation of such guidelines and advice, not least so as to ensure 
that its Article 10 rights are fully recognised and reflected in the work. In those circumstances 
I would expect the guidelines and advice to be prepared and implemented no later than six 
months from the date of this Report.

2.72 

I also recommend that the ICO take steps to prepare and issue comprehensive guidance to 
the public on their individual rights in relation to the obtaining and use by the press of their 
information, and how to exercise them. To demonstrate the effect of this guidance, the ICO 
should include regular updates on the practices of the press in relation to handling of personal 
information in its annual reports to Parliament.

Criminal Law: the sentence for breach of s55 DPA

2.73  The  history  of  the  campaign  started  by  Mr  Thomas  to  amend  s55  DPA  to  introduce  the 
possibility of custodial penalties on conviction (by providing a statutory maximum of two years 
imprisonment) has been set out. The position is that the Criminal Justice and Immigration 
Act 2008 introduced that amendment, but the changes had not been brought into force. A 
statutory instrument, to be laid before Parliament by the Government, is required.

2.74  As a matter of principle, the existence of uncommenced legislation on the statute books is 
potentially problematic. The power of the Secretary of State to commence legislation must, 
by law, be kept under review, so it always remains a live issue. As described elsewhere,45 the 
legislative  process  by  which  the  maximum  penalty  was  increased  and  the  defence  to  the 
substantive offence available to journalists broadened, with both changes left uncommenced, 
was strongly indicative of a political compromise, designed as much as anything to quieten 
two  opposing  campaigning  voices  rather  than  as  a  response  to  a  thought  through  policy 
analysis for which there was genuine empirical evidence. It is not surprising to find that the 
delicate balance of the compromise has not proved something which succeeding Secretaries 
of State for Justice have been in a hurry to revisit.

45  Part I, Chapter 5

1085

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHRecent history of the ICO’s s55 campaign

2.75 

In October 2009, the Government published a consultation paper in seeking views on the 
commencement of both parts of the changes.46 Responses were sought by January 2010, 
with a view to assessing the possibility of activating the changes in the April of that year, 
at the same time as it was proposed to confer on the ICO enhanced powers in relation to 
civil  penalties.  It  does  not  appear  that  the  responses  to  that  consultation  exercise  have 
been published by the Ministry of Justice. However, the press has consistently opposed the 
commencement of the provisions and the then Government did not bring the new provisions 
into force in what were the final weeks before the General Election. Neither has the current 
Administration advanced the position: a decision is now said to await this Report.

2.76  Successive Information Commissioners have continued to press for the increased penalties 
to be brought into force. Mr Thomas repeated his case in his first witness statement to the 
Inquiry:47

“The main reform, in my view, should be an immediate ministerial Order to activate 
the prison sentence for s55 offences. The public controversy of the last two months, 
and public outrage at press misconduct, make the case for that reform more pressing 
than  ever.  Even  if  there  has  been  improvement  in  press  conduct  since  2006  there 
is still no guarantee that this will remain indefinitely and I understand that illegal 
activity remains rife in other sectors. A strong deterrent is needed and it is vital that a 
clear signal should be sent that s55 offences are not trivial or “technical”.”

His exasperation was evident in his oral evidence to the Inquiry:48

“I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government has now not activated 
that provision. … I am very disappointed as an individual now that still, despite all the 
material that has surfaced in recent months, the order has not been activated. It would 
be a very simple matter to bring that into force now, and my broad understanding 
back in 2008 was that it would only be a delay of six months or so, but that has not 
yet materialised.” 

2.77  The ICO campaign on s55 has continued under Mr Graham, but with a perceptible change 
of  emphasis.  The  ICO  submitted  evidence  to  the  consultation  on  activation  of  the  new 
provisions at the end of 200949 but, by this time, Motorman was presented as somewhat 
distant history. The ICO submission focused instead on examples, including half a dozen case 
studies, of the blagging of personal information by deceit in the routine criminal contexts of 
unscrupulous debt-collection, commercial espionage and profiteering, and personal grudge 
and intimidation. Judicial sentencing remarks in cases prosecuted are cited to the effect that 
the sentence maxima on s55 conviction did not allow a sentence to be passed commensurate 
with the criminality of the behaviour. An example is given of ICO investigators executing a 
search warrant:

1086

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH“They were greeted at the premises, by an individual who had a previous conviction for 
a section 55 offence, with the following comments. ‘What’s the maximum fine for this, 
£5000? I will write the cheque out now.’” 

At the other end of spectrum, Mr Graham explained in evidence that he wanted to:50

“…deal with the problem of the courts being limited to fines and then dealing with 
people who are of limited means and can only be fined about £100, and the court 
doesn’t have the option of doing anything about a community sentence or tagging or 
curfew or whatever else might be involved. It’s just the going rate is £100. It happened 
again the week before last. It’s nothing.”

2.78  Other  general  points  are  made  in  the  ICO  submission  to  the  consultation  exercise  about 
the consequences of s55 not being capable of attracting a custodial penalty. Two points in 
particular should be noted:

“At present the offence of unlawful obtaining etc is not a recordable offence. It is not 
therefore recorded on the Police National Computer. Fingerprint impressions, DNA 
samples and descriptive details are not currently taken from those individuals who 
are  prosecuted  by  the  ICO  for  the  section  55  offence  (a  descriptive  form  contains 
personal information relative to the accused person, for example, ethnic appearance, 
build, shoe size, glasses, hair, facial hair, marks, scars and abnormalities etc). If the 
penalties for this offence are increased to imprisonment the offence will become a 
recordable offence. This will not only underline the serious nature of the offence but 
will ensure that those convicted carry a meaningful criminal record.”

The  criminal  record  is  both  a  matter  of  deterrence  in  its  own  right  and  also  of  assisting 
detection. The second point made is that, with a custodial penalty available, s55 crime could 
fit within the framework of the European arrest warrants; data crime is an easy cross-border 
activity, and the availability of simple extradition procedures would overcome jurisdictional 
inhibitions to criminal enforcement.

2.79  Subsequently, including in an update report to the Ministry of Justice in August 201151 and 
in  the  evidence  that  Mr  Graham  provided  to  the  Inquiry,  the  ICO  has  sought  to  turn  the 
spotlight in relation to s55 definitively away from the press altogether. As discussed above, 
that is articulated by way of an assertion that the practices of the press are no longer an 
issue in relation to information blagging. From the perspective of the ICO, however, given the 
history of the s55 campaign, there is no doubt a degree to which the press are simply seen as 
the principal inhibition to the commencement of these provisions. The policy is now to seek 
to neutralise the hostility of the press and emphasising that the policy aim to be achieved 
now has little to do with their activities no doubt has that in mind. Mr Graham illustrated this 
in his evidence when he said:52

“In fact, I went to the Society of Editors conference in 2009 and said: ‘it’s so not about 
you. It’s about NHS workers, it’s about private investigators, it’s about bank clerks, and 
it’s frustrating not to be able to deal with that real challenge, which the Information 
Commissioner’s office is concerned to deal with, because we’re constantly met by the 
press saying, “This is terrible, the sky is falling, the sky is falling”. It really isn’t.’”

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH2.80  That the tension between the ICO and the press on the s55 issue is still very much a current 
source  of  heat  was  vividly  illustrated  by  exchanges  between  Mr  Graham  and  Mr  Rhodri 
Davies  QC,  asking  questions  on  behalf  of  News  International.  This  exchange  is  set  out  at 
some length here because it illustrated in microcosm, and in many ways can be regarded 
as the summation of, the long years of debate and lobbying on this subject, in Parliament, 
in successive Governments, and in other public fora. Mr Davies put it to Mr Graham that, 
if the behaviour of the press was not itself the current operational focus of the campaign, 
nevertheless:53

“The  political  problem,  if  I  can  call  it  that,  that  you  have  in  getting  the  existing 
legislation into force is what we might call the perceived effect on the press. It’s not 
the bank clerks who are campaigning against this; it’s the perceived effect on the 
press which is your problem?
“A. My problem is the press. It’s not the perceived effect on the press, it’s the behaviour 
of the press, worrying away at a penalty designed to deal with a problem which they 
say doesn’t apply to them, and I say, “If it doesn’t apply to you, get out of the way.”
“Q. Isn’t the way through this, which might perhaps satisfy both parties, simply to 
exempt from the threat of a prison sentence anyone who is acting for the special 
purposes of journalism, artistic or literary matters, using the phraseology in Section 
32?
“A. How much of a good deal do you guys want? Excuse me, sir, for being heated 
about this, but you fought everyone to a standstill back in 2006/7. You did it again in 
2009/10. You’ve got so many privileges and exemptions. It’s perfectly possible for a 
journalist to do a decent job legally. There is Section 78 [of the Criminal Justice and 
Immigration  Act  2008]  on  the  statute  book,  applying  the  reasonable  belief  of  the 
journalist that what they were doing for publication was in the public interest. It’s 
going to be very difficult for anyone to strike that down, but there are some people 
who believe that that’s more generous to the press than really should have been the 
case, but that was the deal. Now, if I understand it, you’re sort of coming back for 
more - on behalf of your clients.
“Q. What I’m trying to do, Mr Graham, is to point out a route through the problem, 
or  one that  bypasses  the Gordian  Knot, and  I’m  not  quite understanding  why  this 
solution is not acceptable to you.
“A.  Well,  this  isn’t  a  negotiation  about  these  things,  but  it  sounds  to  me  as  if  the 
representatives of the press want to be somehow above the law. Surely a free press 
operates within a framework of law, and a vibrant and healthy press, challenging 
those in authority and doing the job that it should be doing and the job that I joined 
the profession to do, operates within the law. Yes, okay, you sometimes have to apply 
the dark arts to get the story, and then you’re accountable for it. And if you’re really 
in trouble, that’s the mitigation that you put to the court. But we can’t keep having 
more and more carve-outs and reductions and special cases, surely.
“Q. The point is, Mr Graham, that prison sentences do have a more chilling effect 
than the lesser sanctions available to the court -
“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Is that right, Mr Rhodri Davies? I’d be very interested to 
see evidence about that, because one thing is for rock solid certain: interception of 
communications did have a custodial sentence attached to it, and it didn’t seem to 
have stopped a great deal of activity.

1088

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH“MR DAVIES: Well, that certainly was true-up to 2006/7, I entirely understand that.
“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I’m not, I think, trying to make a cheap point. I’m not doing 
that at all. But I am concerned about the evidence base for the assertion. I’m not 
stopping you, I understand the point, and of course you can pursue it.
“MR DAVIES: Well, I think - really, what I’m putting to you, Mr Graham, is your own 
assumption,  which  is  that  if  the  sentences  available  for  breach  of  Section  55  are 
increased  and  the  range  of  sanctions  available  to  the  court  is  widened,  then  you 
think that that will have a beneficially chilling effect on people who would otherwise 
contemplate a breach of Section 55?
“A.  It  would  have  a  beneficially  chilling  effect  on  DVLC  workers  handing  out  car 
numbers and addresses based on those car numbers in exchange for money. It will 
have a beneficial chilling effect on health workers who apparently think it’s perfectly 
okay to access someone’s medical records in order to find the telephone numbers of 
their in-laws, who they’re having a fight with, or the bank clerk in Haywards Heath 
who thinks it’s fine to look at someone’s bank records in order to provide the case in 
her husband’s defence in a sex attack trial. That’s what we’re dealing with. What’s 
that got to do with the press? If you’re not doing this stuff, get out of the way.
“Q. Yes. I entirely understand those problems.”

2.81  Mr Davies took Mr Graham through some practical examples of where the public interest 
defence might be relied on by a journalist in a s55 case. These drew on the sort of material 
which emerged in Motorman. The exchange continued:54

“MR DAVIES: So that is a situation, Mr Graham, where, as I understand it, you think 
that the journalist might very well have a public interest defence?
“A. I say it’s arguable, anyway.
“Q. It’s arguable. That’s the difficulty, isn’t it? Because once we’re into the territory 
of it’s arguable, and it’s a prison sentence if you’re wrong, do we not have a chilling 
effect?
“A. But all you have to advance is the reasonable belief that the story you’re pursuing 
was in the public interest. Really, if you can’t make that case, you shouldn’t be in 
journalism. It’s a very, very good increased defence for journalists.
“Q. I’m just wondering how far that goes. So you say if there’s a reasonable belief that 
the story you’re pursuing is in the public interest, then that would be a public interest 
defence to obtaining an ex-directory telephone number?
“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I’m not going to allow you, Mr Davies, to use the opportunity 
to  try  and  tie  the  Information  Commissioner  down.  Let  me  say  what  I  presently 
believe, and then people can make submissions in due course. I presently believe that 
the new potential provision contains both subjective and objective elements, so not 
only must the journalist believe that it’s in the public interest to do so, but there must 
be reasonable grounds for that belief. Thereafter, if I follow up your earlier question, 
the  Information  Commissioner  would  have  to  decide  whether  there  was  evidence 
to rebut that defence before he thought of bringing a prosecution. If he thought of 
bringing a prosecution because he thought he could rebut the defence, it would be 
open to the journalist to advance the defence in court. If the court decided against the

1089

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHjournalist, then it would have to decide on a scale how grave the particular offence 
was, and in my experience of sentencing criminal cases, which extends over 27 years, 
I don’t think you’ll find that there would be any question of a mandatory sentence in 
those circumstances at all.”

2.82  No further formal submissions were in fact received by the Inquiry on this subject and it now 
falls therefore to reflect on the extent to which this Report should seek to resolve the matter 
on way or the other. I do not, for the reasons set out above, accept that I should avoid doing 
so on the grounds that I can be confident that the culture, practices and ethics of the press 
are such that it is simply no longer a live issue within the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry. 
Bearing in mind those Terms of Reference, however, it is important to make clear two points. 

2.83  The first point is that the thread of argument in Mr Thomas’s original campaign (that increasing 
the sentencing maxima for s55 was a necessary element in increasing the profile of the data 
protection regime generally, and the seriousness with which it is regarded, whether politically 
of forensically), is not the concern of this Inquiry and not something on which this Report 
can or should express a view. Secondly, since the operational considerations currently being 
advanced in favour of commencing the increased maxima are explicitly said to be directed 
elsewhere than in the direction of the press, these are not considerations within the purview 
of this Inquiry and not matters on which it would be appropriate for this Report to have a 
determinative effect

2.84  S55, in other words, is not a provision of exclusive application to the press, and it is necessary 
that I should be suitably circumspect about any effect of considering the matter otherwise 
than in relation to the press. S55 is, however, a provision which, as amended, has a specific and 
modified application to the press, and to that extent the uncommenced amendments must 
be considered to be part of the special approach to journalism that is evident throughout 
the data protection regime. It is also a provision the history of which, up to and including the 
present day, has been dominated by the press’s policy interests. It is impossible therefore 
to avoid reflecting on the history of the s55 issue in the context of this Report at any rate in 
relation to the press dimension to the policy.

2.85  This is not in any event, as indicated above, simply a policy issue at large. Parliament has 
considered this matter in extensive detail and legislated on it. The very strong presumption 
must be that Parliament does not legislate in idleness. Deferred implementation of legislation, 
in the rare instances in which that is deliberate policy, is usually a matter of making provision 
for preliminary practical issues or, as in this case, to allow for contingent events. The s55 
contingency might be described as a policy of waiting to see whether the mere uncommenced 
existence of the possibility of a prison sentence would itself prove to be a deterrent to criminal 
activity. There appears to be ample evidence that criminal activity comprising the knowing or 
reckless misuse of personal information continues to be a real problem, and that specifically 
the absence of a potential custodial sentence (which would therefore permit sentences short 
of custody such as a community penalty) has emerged as a contributory factor. This is not 
least because, as Mr Graham made clear, a financial penalty must be related to means to pay 
and those of limited means will therefore face potential sanctions which have little correlation 
with the gravity of the offence and the potential for harm. 

2.86  The only reason which has been cited to the Inquiry for failure to commence the provisions 
for  increasing  the  maximum  potential  sentence  is  the  potentially  damaging  effect  that  it 
would have on journalism. These are not considerations which, in my view, can reasonably 
argued to be persuasive, let alone determinative.

1090

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH2.87 

In  the  first  place,  the  argument  that  the  prospect  of  custody  would  have  a  differential 
‘chilling’  effect  on  lawful  and  ethical  journalism  from  the  prospect  of  a  financial  penalty 
is one which it is barely respectable for national  press organisations to advance at all.  Its 
necessary implication is that the prospect of a criminal conviction can, of itself, be regarded 
as a tolerable business risk, and a criminal fine a tolerable overhead, in journalism. This says 
little  more  than  that  ‘unchilled’  journalism  is  an  activity  which  takes  calculated  risks  with 
deliberate and indefensible criminality. This is an argument for criminal impunity including 
(as it was put before the Inquiry) by way of a plea for indemnity from the otherwise universal 
application of criminal penalties; it amounts to special pleading to be placed above the law. 
I put the matter starkly, because no-one reading this Report should be in any doubt as to the 
true nature of the argument being advanced on behalf of the press in its most unqualified 
form.

2.88  There  is  a  more  respectable  version  of  the  argument  that  there  is  a  chilling  effect  in  this 
provision. That version is not a contention that the press should be indulged in committing 
calculated criminality. It is an argument that the boundaries in this territory between what 
is criminal and what is not are not clear enough to make it safe for journalists to operate 
confidently. It is not an argument therefore about the consequences of criminality but about 
the risks of crossing criminal boundaries unwittingly. Where the boundaries are unclear, the 
possibility of a custodial penalty raises the stakes to the extent that decent journalists will 
have to take a risk-averse approach and give them a wide berth. The result, so the argument 
goes, is that some areas of investigative journalism on the right side of the law will be lost and 
that this would be contrary to the public interest.

2.89  This remains an argument which envisages journalism tracking the boundaries of crime in a 
way which is not, and has not been over the years in which the s55 issue has been debated, 
empirically evidenced as a genuine operational problem to any degree; neither does it deal 
with the ethical (and indeed legal) questions which are raised by behaviour which is only 
just on the right side of crime. But the important point is that it is essentially an argument 
about whether the provision made in the new defence to cater for journalistic operations 
where  they  do  sail  close  to  the  wind  is  adequate.  If  the  defence  deals  satisfactorily  with 
the boundaries between criminal and lawful journalism, then the question of the ultimate 
penalty must be a genuine second-order issue.

2.90 

It is hard to see how the new defence could go any further. If a journalist engages in a course 
of conduct which prima facie crosses the criminal boundary marking the unlawful acquisition 
of personal information, but can show that he or she was acting with a view to publication 
and in the reasonable belief that it was in the public interest, there can be no conviction. 
Note that it is not even necessary to show that the conduct was in fact, in the end, in the 
public interest. There is no alternative to asking the journalist to establish that the belief was 
genuine, because its basis will be uniquely within his or her own knowledge. And if the belief 
was neither genuine nor rational it is hard to see the case for a defence to crime. The provision 
made by the new defence to give honest journalists trying to respect the boundaries of the 
criminal law confidence in doing so, appears to be straightforward to understand, and more 
than adequate in giving honesty the benefit of the doubt.

2.91 

I  am,  therefore,  entirely  unpersuaded  that  the  argument  that  there  is  a  possible  chilling 
effect  on  legitimate  journalism  is  a  reasonable  one,  and  should  be  regarded  as  a  proper 
reason in itself for continuing to resist giving effect to the legislation. Much more the point: 
Parliament has already settled the matter from a policy point of view. To the extent that the 
press effectively wishes to reopen not the question of penal policy  but the matter of the 
substantive law itself, it is both too late and devoid of merit. Without suggesting that no other 

1091

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHformulation of the new defence is imaginable, Parliament has given very close attention to 
the alternatives, and settled on something which, on any fair analysis, is fully capable of being 
made to work for the press.

2.92 

I am conscious that in recommending the activation of the amendments to the Data Protection 
Act created by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, this Report is dealing with an 
issue with considerable history, and not just as a matter of addressing the culture, practices 
and ethics of the press in relation the acquisition and use of private personal information. It is 
also addressing the operations of the press as powerful lobbyists on self-interested questions 
of media law and policy. On both of these grounds, I conclude that the public interest, taken 
in the round, favours there being no further delay in the implementation of this measure.

2.93  As  indicated  in  the  Government  consultation  paper,55  therefore,  I  recommend  that  the 
necessary  steps  are  taken  (by  statutory  instrument)  to  increase  the  sentence  maxima  on 
conviction for an offence under s55, to include, in addition to the current fines, custodial 
penalties  up  to  the  statutory  maximum  on  summary  conviction,  and,  on  conviction  on 
indictment, up to two years’ imprisonment. 

2.94 

It  is  important  to  underline  that  I  also  recommend  that  the  enhanced  defence  for  public 
interest journalism be activated at the same time. 

Prosecution powers of the ICO

2.95  Before concluding this part of the Report, a number of further aspects of the criminal law 
functions of the ICO in relation to the press fall to be considered. One particularly important 
piece of context to the s55 debate is the fact that this is the only offence in respect of which the 
ICO has prosecution powers. There are other criminal offences which are also contraventions 
of the data protection regime when committed in relation to personal information (which, 
incidentally, already attract the possibility of custodial sentences). There may be considerable 
overlap between these other offences and s55. Examples include:

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 

phone hacking contrary to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000;56
computer hacking contrary to the Computer Misuse Act 1990;57 
offences of corruption, bribery and aiding and abetting misconduct in public office; and
inchoate and accessory offences including attempt and conspiracy.

2.96  There is indeed an argument that, since the first data protection principle requires that all 
acquisition and use of personal information must be fair and lawful, all criminal offences in 
relation to personal information within the meaning of the data protection regime will also 
constitute a breach of that regime.58 In practice, in any case in which a breach of the data 
protection regime may also constitute a criminal offence other than under s55, the ICO will 
effectively hand the matter in its entirety, and defer wholly, to the police and the CPS. That 
is at least in part because all of the other offences comprehend, including by way of higher 
sentencing maxima, a much wider spectrum of seriousness. That is important context for 
the decision in Motorman itself which, effectively, was to stand back from the prosecution 
process while the police and CPS proceeded with corruption and conspiracy prosecutions. 
But it has two important practical consequences.

about the first data protection principle and civil torts

1092

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH2.97  The first consequence is that it effectively relegates s55 to a wholly residuary position, in 
practice only of real use in cases where all other criminal possibilities have been eliminated. 
But the process of elimination itself may, including by reason of delay, weaken the prospect 
in  the  end  of  bringing  s55  charges.  Secondly,  it  also  puts  the  ICO  at  a  disadvantage  in 
considering cases of breach of the data protection principles in the round, including giving 
full consideration to alternatives to prosecution. So in cases at the extreme end of breaches 
of the principles and rights of the regime, the expert regulator is in danger of being left out 
of the picture altogether.

2.98  Mr Graham explained the position in his witness statement to the Inquiry:59

“In some circumstances, such as an allegation of unlawful processing, I have to rely 
on the police and the CPS to indicate whether they consider that an offence under 
another relevant Act has been committed before I can properly assess whether there 
has also been an associated breach of the data protection principle on which I might 
act. On the other hand if my office comes into possession of evidence which suggests 
that an offence has been committed under other legislation, I would pass this directly 
to the police or suggest to a complainant that he or she does so…..
“It is possible that, in some circumstances, personal data could be obtained in a way 
that suggests the commission of offences under both another Act and under section 
55  of  the  Act.  The  investigation  of  offences  which  carry  a  custodial  penalty  takes 
precedence over the investigation of offences, such as those under the Act, which do 
not. Usually, the police will take the lead in investigating where penalties that carry 
a custodial penalty are suspected. They can consider the offence under section 55 of 
the Act as part of their investigation if they choose to do so. Whilst my office will pass 
relevant information on to the police to assist them in any investigation, it does not 
make good sense for us to run our own investigation in parallel.”

2.99  As considered at length above, this cannot stand as a full account of the operational inaction 
of the ICO in relation to the press and its involvement in Operation Motorman. But it does 
suggest a weakness in the scheme of the powers and functions of the ICO. It is a weakness 
which would be remedied in part by the activation of the higher sentence maxima for s55 
because,  at  least,  it  would  address  the  problem  of  its  role  as  an  offence  of  last  resort  by 
strengthening  the  ability  of  the  ICO  to  prosecute  s55  cases  which  also  constitute  other 
offences. But it would not address the position of the ICO as a prosecutor of last resort or the 
disabling effect of that on its consideration of the exercise of its other regulatory functions in 
relation to serious abuses of personal information.

2.100  This  is  a point of  considerable  importance for that strand  of  opinion  in  relation  to  phone 
hacking that urged that the primary response of this Inquiry should be to ensure that the 
existing law (and, in particular, the existing criminal law) is properly enforced. As fully set out 
above,60 the huge investment of the resources of the Metropolitan Police in their current 
Operations Weeting (phone hacking), Tuleta (computer hacking), and Elveden (corruption) 
is both unsustainable indefinitely and unrepeatable in the future. It is, however, noteworthy 
that all concern the possibility of the press committing crimes which involves the acquisition 
of personal information in breach of the data protection principles.

Graham.pdf
60  Part E, Chapter 5

1093

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkH2.101  Information crime in contexts involving neither national security issues nor the furtherance 
of other criminal purposes (that is to say, crime constituted wholly by the extreme violation 
of personal information privacy), is a matter which cannot hold a place at the top of the police 
agenda in competition with the many other priorities that the police face. Nor, in any event, 
can the police be expected to invest in the deep expertise in personal information privacy 
which the data protection regime envisages in for its own regulatory authority. Furthermore, 
the handling by the police of these cases is effectively binary: charges are either brought or 
dropped, without consideration of law enforcement issues falling short of criminal liability. 
The  present  disposition  of  prosecution  powers  therefore  presents  a  threat  to  the  proper 
enforcement of privacy crime in the future, including in relation to the press.

2.102  One possible way to address that problem would be to enable the ICO to prosecute breaches 
of the data protection regime which constituted criminal offences whether or not they did so 
as a result of s55. This would, in particular, enable the ICO to deal with cases of data abuse 
going beyond the processes of first acquisition of the information. It would have a number of 
specific advantages. It would:

(a) 

relieve  the  police  and  CPS  of  the  pressure  of  privacy  crime  on  their  priorities  and 
resources;

(b)  place  prosecution  in  the  hands  of  an  expert  regulator  who  would  be  well  placed  to 
investigate cases and if appropriate place their full criminality before the criminal courts;
enable cases to be dealt with within the rounded context of a regulatory regime which 
has a range of other operational options falling short of prosecution.

(c) 

Three matters would, however, have to be addressed in taking forward thinking in this context.

2.103  The first is the necessity of acknowledging, again, that this is not an issue of sole application 
to the press, and that it is beyond the purview of this Inquiry to address its implications in 
areas which have nothing to do with its terms of reference. As against that, however, it is 
necessary  to  note  the  very  close  association  of  the  issue  of  prosecution  powers  with  the 
s55 issue as discussed extensively above. And whereas it is to a degree speculative to reflect 
on the Motorman case itself from this perspective, there are genuine questions, including 
those raised at the time and since by the ICO itself, as to whether in the circumstance an 
information regulator, alive to the magnitude and nature of the breach of the law and good 
practice of the data protection regime and armed with a full range of responses up to and 
including prosecution for serious offences, would not have afforded the best prospects of 
effective law enforcement and of making the case a turning point for the good in the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press in the handling of personal information.

2.104  The second matter that would need to be addressed would be the capability and governance 
of the ICO itself in handling any enhanced prosecution functions. In so far as those questions 
have wider implications  they are addressed more generally  below. But it would  be highly 
desirable to ensure that in all of its prosecution functions there was excellent liaison between 
the ICO and the police and CPS. It might, for example, be desirable to make the exercise of 
any powers to prosecute s55 cases which also constitute or may constitute other criminal 
offences and criminal breaches of the data protection regime falling outside s55 formally the 
subject of a duty to consult with the CPS.

2.105  The  third  matter  concerns  the  position  of  the  press  as  the  potential  subjects  of  criminal 
investigation by the ICO. Under that heading two issues in particular present themselves. The 
first relates to the circumstances in which the ICO might bring a prosecution as opposed to 

1094

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHrelying on its civil regulatory powers. That is a question which would need to be addressed 
by reference to the public interest. At the invitation of the Inquiry and following consultation, 
the Director of Public Prosecutions has issued guidelines for prosecutors on assessing the 
public  interest  in  cases  affecting  the  media.61  The  ICO  would  be  expected  to  follow  these 
guidelines in the exercise of any enhanced prosecution powers and indeed in relation to its 
current powers. Mr Graham has already indicated that he is:62

“happy  to  give  an  assurance  that  I  will  not  seek  to  prosecute  journalists  who  are 
genuinely  pursuing  enquiries  in  the  public  interest,  even  if  those  enquiries  do  not 
ultimately bear fruit.”

2.106  Subject  to  the  point  of  generality  noted  above,  my  conclusion,  therefore,  is  that  proper 
and proportionate enforcement of the criminal law in relation to press abuse of personal 
information would be enhanced by extending the prosecution powers of the ICO to include 
offences  which  comprehend  a  breach  of  the  data  protection  principles  in  addition  to  the 
offence created by s55 of the DPA, coupled with a duty (whether formal or informal) to consult 
the CPS on such prosecutions, and the formal adoption by the ICO of the CPS guidelines on 
media prosecutions.

2.107  I recommend also that the ICO take immediate steps to engage with the Metropolitan Police 
on the preparation of a long-term strategy in relation to alleged media crime with a view to 
handling the issue in the aftermath of Operations Weeting, Tuleta and Elveden, on the basis 
that the priority currently being given by the police to addressing this form of alleged criminal 
behaviour is not sustainable indefinitely, and with a view to ensuring that the ICO is well 
placed to fulfil any necessary role in this respect in future.

2.108  The position of the ICO as prosecutor of last resort does not fully account for evident weaknesses 
in its handling of the question of criminal investigations in relation to the journalists involved 
in Operation Motorman. The ICO has prosecution powers at all because it is uniquely placed 
to view personal information privacy crime in the full context of its regulatory regime as a 
whole. This includes the perspective of the victim in such a context. That is a responsibility 
which it does not appear was fully engaged let alone discharged. I consider, however, that the 
enhancement of the prosecution powers of the ICO has a potential positively to support that 
position of overview and overall direction regarding information privacy breaches that are so 
serious as to enter the criminal spectrum. Further, it is reasonable to conclude that it could 
help to dissolve artificial boundaries, avoid confusion of accountabilities and support a better 
focus on the nature of the conduct and its impact on the individual.

2.109  A  final  issue  to  be  considered  within  the  framework  of  formal  criminal  law  enforcement 
is the matter of sentencing. When dealing with the criminal law generally,63 I recommend 
that the Sentencing Council of England and Wales be asked to prepare guidelines in relation 
to  information  privacy  and  misuse  offences  (including  computer  misuse):  for  the  sake  of 
completeness, it is sufficient simply to repeat the recommendation and refer to the reasons 
for it.

Chapter 5 | Issues About the Legal FrameworkHConclusions and recommendations on the legal framework

2.110  The recommendations set out above are not intended to do other than provide for more 
effective enforcement of the existing principles of law as they stand, and for a fairer, more 
even handed approach to the reconciliation of existing rights within those principles in cases 
in which they may conflict. They are also intended, importantly, substantially to simplify the 
law and make it more accessible to those, that is to say both press and the public, whom 
it is designed to serve. There are implications in these recommendations also for the legal 
system, the legal profession and the courts. Although the data protection regime is intended 
to sit lightly on businesses and not regularly to trouble the world of litigation, that is precisely 
because it is explicit in the provision it makes as a matter of law; in the rare cases where it 
does need to enter the legal system to resolve a disputed issue, the fundamental liberties 
with which it deals, and the sensitivity with which it deals with them need to be recognised 
for what they are.

2.111  As Mr Coppel has pointed out, the European Commission is currently considering replacing the 
existing Data Protection Directive with a directly applicable regulation. The present proposed 
Regulation would leave it to individual Member States to provide in detail for the exemptions 
or derogations it sets out. Those include provision relating to the processing of personal data 
for journalistic purposes. That means that it would be for Parliament in due course to come 
up with a suitable formulation, within the limits of what the regulation eventually requires. 
In other words, the expectation is that Parliament will have to revisit this topic in any event. 

2.112  It would be unfortunate if that were regarded as reason for legislative inaction in the meantime. 
Any new regulation would itself, of course, have to make general provision within the overall 
requirement of the ECHR for a balance between Articles 8 and 10, and indeed would any UK 
domestic legislation. The risk posed by the prospect of a new regulation that any legislation 
prompted by this Report would have to be revisited seems to me in this respect to be of 
modest proportions, and to be outweighed by the need to make progress on amendment to 
the 1998 Act, both as a matter of law and of policy.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHChapter 6 
the relationship: the iC o and the 
press

1.  “too big for us?”
1.1 

This section of the Report takes its title from the passage in Mr Owens’ evidence where he 
describes an exchange in a meeting he says took place with Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse in 
which he sought to explain the full extent of the Motorman ‘treasure trove’. Mr Owens said:1

“Well, it was at the end, I basically said what we have here, if we haven’t got any 
public defence we can go for everybody, from the blagger right up to the newspaper, 
at which point there was a look of horror on Mr Aldhouse’s face and he said, “We 
can’t take them on, they’re too big for us”, and Mr Thomas just sort of bemused, deep 
in  thought,  just  said,  “Fine,  thanks  very  much,  Alex,  pass  my  compliments  on  and 
congratulations to the team for me, job well done.” And that was basically it.”

Both Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse have said that they had no recollection of the meeting and 
disclaimed the language attributed to them by Mr Owens in any event. 

1.2  Mr Owens, however, amplified in his evidence that he had formed the clear impression that 
there was, if not an express instruction or even express language, a cultural understanding 
within the ICO that the press were too big for the office to take on:2

“The  decision  not  to  pursue  any  journalist  was  based  solely  on  fear  –  fear  of  the 
power,  wealth  and  influence  of  the  Press  and  the  fear  of  the  backlash  that  could 
follow if the press turned against ICO.” 

1.3  Mr Thomas specifically challenged Mr Owens’ reliability as a witness in this context, even 
suggesting  that  he  may  have  had  a  motive,  in  the  light  of  “a  number  of  performance, 
disciplinary and grievance issues between Mr Owens and the ICO”, to put the latter in a poor 
light3 this is an inference that Mr Owens, in turn, resisted.4 

1.4  Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse were also emphatic that there was not at any time in the ICO a 
deliberate or explicit policy of holding back from taking action in respect of the press, or from 
engaging directly with the press, whether from fear or otherwise. As we have seen, a number 
of operational rationales have been given in explanation of the ‘roads not taken’.

1.5 

It is not appropriate now for me to seek to resolve the evident dispute between Mr Owens 
and the ICO and, in particular, it is not necessary to determine whether the conversation 
as recounted by Mr Owens took place or not. It is not even necessary for me to determine

Hwhether there was a deliberate, explicit or promulgated policy in the ICO of not ‘taking on’ 
the  press  which  was  operative  during  the  course  of  the  Motorman  decision-making.  The 
question addressed in this part of the Report relates to something more fundamental, and at 
the same time less easy to pinpoint, which is the extent to which there may have underlying 
assumptions in the culture of the ICO and its leadership which instinctively held them back 
from an engagement with the press which their knowledge of the extent of the problem, and 
an objective assessment of their available powers, functions and options, might otherwise 
have suggested. Regardless of whether the words were ever uttered, it is legitimate to ask 
whether ‘the press are too big for us’ did, in fact, accurately identify some reluctance, or lack 
of confidence, in dealing with the press which goes some way to explaining events.

1.6  With the single (and, in the event, salutary) exception discussed  below, the ICO does not 
appear ever seriously to have tested its regulatory powers in relation to the press. Successive 
Information  Commissioners  have  taken  the  view  that  the  law  must  be  understood  to 
discourage them from doing so. Although it is clear that there are features of the current 
data protection regime which seem to make it unnecessarily difficult for the ICO to apply 
the law to the press, the conclusion that the press is not the business of the ICO is not one 
for which any authority in law can, in the end, be claimed. Moreover successive Information 
Commissioners have never sought to draw attention to problems in applying the current law 
to the press. If there was a case for political campaigning for changes to the law, it is legitimate 
to ask why it was not addressed to the impediments to mainstream civil law enforcement 
rather than the relatively more peripheral issue of criminal penalties.

1.7 

1.8 

1.9 

Even  more  notable  has  been  the  reluctance  of  the  ICO  to  engage  informally  with  the 
industry  (otherwise  than  by  way  of  the  PCC  or  other  intermediary  bodies),  whether  as  a 
matter of law enforcement, of promoting good practice or simply of business education and 
communication. Successive Information Commissioners assured the Inquiry that the press 
was simply not a priority for the ICO’s attention. And yet Operation Motorman was one of 
the biggest operational cases to confront the ICO and the basis for two reports to Parliament 
and years of campaigning with the PCC and successive Governments. This was a case with the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press at its heart. Furthermore, the current press issues 
relating to phone hacking have created one of the biggest crises of confidence in the integrity 
of private information to have been experienced in the UK.

On the face of it, this phenomenon is not straightforward to understand. The question before 
the Inquiry was whether there is evidence of a failure of regulatory will on the part of the ICO 
in relation to the press, going beyond the specifics of the Motorman case, and the technical 
imperfections of the legal regime, to a more general reluctance to discharge its functions in 
this area.

The ICO and The Sunday Times
In considering this question, it is interesting to turn first to a series of events which predate 
many  of  the  key  developments  in  the  Motorman  case.  It  was  put  to  Mr  Thomas  in  oral 
evidence that the ICO had invited the editor of The Sunday Times, Mr Witherow, to attend 
interview under caution in 2003 in respect of possible breaches of s55 of the DPA in relation 
to the tax affairs of Lord Levy. Mr Thomas said he had no knowledge of this whatever, but 
having been put on notice of the question earlier he had checked with Mr Aldhouse, with 
whom the account ‘rang a faint bell’. Mr Thomas offered this thought:5

Afternoon-Hearing-9-December-2011.pdf

1098

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH“If that had been the case – and can I speculate? If the Office had invited the editor and 
had been rebuffed, that might perhaps have influenced people at the investigatory 
level as to the problems of interviewing people from the press. I don’t know.”

He suggested that it might have been before his time.

1.10  The history appears to have been that The Sunday Times had published an article in 2000 
about the tax affairs of Lord Levy which the latter had sought to prevent by means of an 
application for an injunction which had come before the then Mr Justice Toulson. According 
to  Mr  Witherow,6  that  attempt  failed  “because  the  judge  decided  that  publication  of 
the  information  was  firmly  in  the  public  interest”;  Mr  Witherow  described  Mr  Thomas  as 
subsequently seeking to interview him under caution about the Lord Levy story but “again 
this was rebuffed because of our public interest defence”, in support of which the judgment 
of Toulson J was deployed. Mr Witherow thought the ICO had accepted that.7 Eventually, the 
Sunday Times ran a front page story on 29 October 2006 connecting Lord Levy with a ‘cash 
for honours’ scandal.

1.11  The matter was explored further with Mr Thomas by Mr Rhodri Davies QC on behalf of News 
International.8 Mr Thomas had taken up his post in November 2002 and it was in fact on 11 
December 2002 that the ICO wrote to Mr Witherow inviting him to attend an interview under 
caution. The signatory of the letter was an investigator in the ICO junior to Alex Owens. The 
proposition which, in effect, Mr Davies put to Mr Thomas was that the attempt to interview 
Mr Witherow was the direct result of powerful and well-connected pressure being applied 
to the ICO by Lord Levy rather than any independent operational consideration, and was in 
effect misconceived in the first place because it was plain that nothing other than investigative 
journalism in the public interest was in issue. Whether or not that was the case is not to 
the purpose of this Inquiry, although Mr Thomas accepted that Lord Levy had, around the 
relevant time, “expressed quite strong frustration that my office had not been much use at 
sorting out his complaints” and that this was not the first time the office had been subject to 
high profile criticism from a public figure who had gone to them with a problem. 

1.12  This  episode  is  of  interest  to  the  Inquiry  not  because  of  any  light  it  may  shed  on  the 
susceptibility of the ICO to operational pressure from high profile complainants, but because 
it stands out as the only occasion on which, so far as we have been able to establish, the 
ICO attempted to exert its functions directly in relation to the press. Mr Davies put it to Mr 
Thomas that this was, in fact, the only occasion upon which “the big stick of an interview 
under caution was wielded” by the ICO against the press; Mr Thomas confirmed that he was 
not aware of any other example in which the ICO “directly approached a journalist or editor”. 
Moreover, Mr Thomas sought to distance himself from the Witherow decision; he suggested 
that it was taken at a junior level and that it did not look entirely defensible. The contrast with 
the absence of any approach to a journalist or editor in the Motorman case was made by Mr 
Davies for a different purpose from that of the Inquiry, but is nevertheless memorable.

1.13  The  issue  of  the  impact  on  the  ICO  of  its  rebuff  at  the  hands  of  the  Mr  Witherow  is  not 
unimportant. The episode evidently remained in the memory of The Sunday Times, and it is 
interesting to note that the one or two subsequent occasions on which that title and the ICO 
had occasion to interact had a distinctively adversarial quality.

Chapter 6 | The relationship: the ICO and the pressH1.14  The first concerns the editorial published in The Sunday Times on 29 October 2006 which 
is the day the paper led on its front page with the Lord Levy ‘cash for honours’ story. The 
thrust of the editorial was in opposition to the campaign by Mr Thomas for an increase to 
the maximum penalty for breach of s55 of the DPA; it cast the proposition as offensive to 
democracy and free speech and it was not sparing in the aspersions cast on Mr Thomas’s 
intentions in this respect. A couple of brief excerpts will give a flavour:9

“…the role of the press in protecting the public by exposing the abuses of the powerful. 
Newspapers had already been doing this for centuries when he took up his post four 
years ago. This duty of the media is vital in the struggle to maintain an open society. 
Yet Mr Thomas would send reporters to prison for fulfilling it.”
“Mr Thomas is complicit in placing another brick in the wall that the state is building 
to  protect  itself  from  unwanted  scrutiny.  This  newspaper’s  front  page  story  today 
on cash for honours is precisely the sort of investigation that political parties would 
prefer not to happen. Mr Thomas is doing his bit to help them.”

The  editorial  also  alluded  to  What  Price  Privacy?  as  a  ‘little  noticed  report’.  Mr  Thomas 
wrote to the paper a couple of days later in response, but his letter does not appear to have 
been published.

1.15  Mr  Thomas  characterised  this  editorial  as  an  unfair  representation  of  his  campaign,  and 
accordingly  as  a  recognisable  part  of  the  concerted  press  campaign  to  oppose  it.10  More 
controversially, he said that he made a connection in his mind between the editorial and 
the meeting he had had with Les Hinton and others on the previous Friday as part of his PCC 
campaign, at which of course the difference of views on the s55 issue had played a prominent 
part. When he aired this thought in the Inquiry, it was subjected both to detailed rebuttal and 
to further challenge of his attitude to the press more generally. Mr Witherow made explicit the 
belief of The Sunday Times that, because the ICO had sought to interview him under caution 
in 2002, it was a matter of concern that Mr Thomas would not have adequately considered 
issues of the public interest in investigative journalism in running his s55 campaign.11 Further, 
Mr Davies, on behalf of News International, put it to Mr Thomas that it was relevant that, on 
the intervening Saturday, The Times had published an interview with Mr Thomas that he had 
given a few weeks previously in an effort to obtain some press coverage for an international 
data protection conference in London the following week.12 

1.16  Mr Thomas accepted the evidence that there was no connection between the meeting with 
Mr Hinton and the editorial, concluding: “It appears I’m even wrong to raise questions…”.13 
But it appears significant that, in rebutting the idea of a connection between the editorial 
and a meeting two days earlier, NI chose instead to make a connection between the editorial 
and the ICO attempt to interview the editor of the newspaper four years earlier. Whatever 
Mr Thomas and the ICO had learned from that attempt, the impact on The Sunday Times 
was manifest.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH1.17  A further exchange took place several weeks after the publication of the editorial. The managing 
editor  of  The  Sunday  Times,  then  Richard  Caseby,  wrote  to  Mr  Thomas  on  14  December 
2006,14 in the aftermath of the publication of What Price Privacy Now? (and after battle lines 
had effectively been drawn over the s55 policy issue) to express “grave concerns” over the 
publication  in  that  report  of  further  details  of  the  Motorman  information,  particularly  as 
it related to The Sunday Times. The tone of the letter can be described as confrontational; 
it alleges that the report was “clearly defamatory” of the publishers and managing editor 
(Mr Caseby himself), raises a number of points about the Motorman evidence and, before 
concluding with a request for an explanation and remedial steps as soon as possible, states 
that the writer did “not believe that your conduct in this matter can be described as fair, or 
that it meets the standards which one should be entitled to expect from a regulator”.

1.18  Mr Thomas’ response of 2 February 200715 was a measured explanation of why the ICO had 
been entitled, or to an extent required, by virtue of its role and functions to deal as it had 
with the information published in What Price Privacy Now? but indicated that, on revisiting 
the figures connected with The Sunday Times, it had discovered an error in the report. Rather 
than identifying the title with 52 alleged transactions involving 7 journalists, it should have 
identified  it  with  only  4  transactions  and  a  single  journalist.  For  this  the  letter  offered  an 
unqualified  apology,  and  Mr  Thomas  explained  that  the  error  was  corrected  in  letters  to 
Parliament and to all the recipients of the report.16

1.19  This account of interactions between the ICO and The Sunday Times is set out in detail here 

because it brings into focus the following issues:

(a) 

(b) 

It  raises  again  the  question  of  distance  between  the  senior  leadership  of  the  ICO 
and  operational  decision-making  with  very  high  profile  and  long  lasting  strategic 
consequences. Mr Thomas was apparently not involved in and had no foreknowledge 
of the decision to try to interview Mr Witherow, and accepted that the way the decision 
was taken was unsatisfactory. There were lessons to be learned in this about the vital 
need  for  the  senior  leadership  to  be  sighted  on  and  involved  in  major  operational 
decisions of this reputational nature.
It illustrates with some clarity what might be described as the ideological opposition of 
the press to the assertion of law enforcement powers, even in criminal matters, and the 
lack of objectivity and restraint with which that resistance is manifested; this is a matter 
considered extensively elsewhere in this Report.

(d) 

(c)  On  the  other  hand,  it  also  illustrates  the  dangers  to  the  operational  credibility  of  a 
regulator  such  as  the  ICO  in  investing  so  heavily,  prominently  and  persistently  in  a 
political campaign to which a regulated sector was obviously deeply antagonistic. 
It can hardly be doubted that the reverberations of these adversarial encounters (many 
of which were played out in public) would have been felt personally by Mr Thomas and 
by the staff of the ICO. Whether or not Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse felt or articulated 
the view that the press was ‘too big for us’, I consider it almost inevitable that Mr Owens 
and his small team (to whom operational decision-making was effectively consigned) 
learned that lesson from the experience of trying to utilise their powers on the press in 
the form of the editor of The Sunday Times.

1101

Chapter 6 | The relationship: the ICO and the pressHOperational ‘monkey tricks’

1.20  With that significant narrative thread in mind, it falls to consider what can be known or can be 
deduced about the thinking of the ICO more generally in relation to the press. Mr Aldhouse 
denied  being  party  to  any  “timorous  approach”  to  the  press17;  as  well  as  disclaiming  the 
attitude that ‘the press are too big to take on’ he cited his experience of discussions in 1996 
which was the run up to the passage of the 1998 Act. He said that:

“we were quite happy to stand up to the media and try to negotiate with them. I wish 
I still had the copies of the press gazette articles roundly attacking Elizabeth France 
[the then Data Protection Registrar - the ICO predecessor body] and myself. So I don’t 
fear the media…”

It might be observed, however, that these experiences were evidently not on the operational 
side of the business, and that, in any event, Mr Aldhouse evidently considered his role to be 
at some distance from the operational decisions where fear of the press might have played 
a material role.

1.21  The Inquiry pursued explicitly with Mr Thomas himself the question of whether the power or 
influence of the press, or his perception of it, in any way affected the operational decisions 
taken in the Motorman case. He said that it did not, nor did he have any fear himself of the 
press.18 As we have seen, both Mr Thomas and Mr Aldhouse rejected any suggestion that 
there had been a deliberate, explicit or promulgated policy of holding back from taking any 
proactive operational measures in respect of evidence of press contravention of the legal 
requirements of the data protection regime or in respect of promoting good practice in data 
protection matters within the industry. Again, it is not the concern of this Part of the Report 
to establish the existence or otherwise of a formal policy, but to explore the nature of any 
significant cultural or psychological predispositions within the ICO and its leadership not to 
assert itself with the press or at least not to do so in an adversarial or confrontational way.

1.22  Standing  back  to  consider  the  explanations  for  the  various  paths  not  taken  by  the  office 
in  the  Motorman  case,  the  following  reflections  presented  themselves.  The  explanation 
for  targeting  the  ‘middlemen’  (that  is  to  say,  the  investigation  agencies)  rather  than  the 
commissioning  journalists  proceeded  by  reference  to  an  analogy  with  drug  dealers  which 
I consider misconceived.19 This was not a market in which the private investigators were a 
dominant power, controlling supplies of standard goods and pushing them on a disadvantaged 
clientele.  It  was  a  market  in  which  the  press  were  the  dominant  power,  commissioning 
bespoke products from what must be assumed to be a limited number of investigators willing 
to obtain them at some risk to themselves. 

1.23 

Indeed, Mr Thomas himself, in explaining the stance taken in What Price Privacy?, stated that 
it was the journalists who were driving this market.20 He said the same thing in explaining his 
policy decision to proceed by engagement with the PCC: the focus there also was on stopping 
the  market.21  Accordingly,  it  is  difficult  to  accept  at  face  value  the  logic  of  concentrating

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHexclusively on the middlemen on the grounds that they were “organising the illegal trade”.22 
The middlemen were on the supply-side, but it was the power of the demand-side which 
must account to a large degree account for the existence of the trade. The conclusions of 
What Price Privacy? put the point rather well:23

“These offences occur because there is a market for this kind of information. At a 
time  when  senior  members  of  the  press  were  publicly  congratulating  themselves 
for having raised journalistic standards across the industry, many newspapers were 
continuing  to  subscribe  to  an  undercover  economy  devoted  to  obtaining  a  wealth 
of personal information forbidden to them by law. One remarkable fact is how well 
documented this underworld turned out to be.”

1.24  At least one operative reason why the ICO took no direct enforcement action against any 
journalist, editor or proprietor in response to Motorman (and, in particular, no prosecution 
action) was evident apprehension about the likely response of the press to any attempt to do 
so. Mr Thomas told the Inquiry that, in planning to wait and see how criminal proceedings 
against  the  investigators  and  public  officials  fared  before  actively  considering  any  further 
enforcement action:24

“I was also conscious that any action against journalists would be a major logistical, 
evidential and legal challenge, would almost certainly be strongly resisted and would 
be very expensive for an Office with very limited resources.”

1.25  The evidential and legal challenges in the way of prosecution (which including the protection 
afforded to journalistic materials and sources) may have been significant, but the prospects 
of facing combative defence litigation appeared to be a disincentive in its own right. Counsel 
instructed by the CPS in Operation Glade was reported to have described the experience of 
dealing with press defendants in these memorable terms:25

“London counsel indicated that the journalists were interviewed and were found to 
be tricky, well armed and well briefed, effectively a barrel of monkeys.”

1.26  Pressed as to whether this suggested an excessively circumspect approach on the part of the 
ICO in the face of potentially powerful prima facie evidence of criminality, Mr Thomas put it 
this way:26

“Well, I have to look at it from all points of view, I suppose, but I can see that the 
media  would  not  like  any  of  their  journalists  being  prosecuted  and  I  suspect  they 
would, for example, argue there’s a public interest in being able to ensure freedom 
of expression. Now, I don’t believe that, I don’t accept that, but I – it’s one thing as to 
whether or not that would be successful, but one can anticipate that that sort of point 
would have been raised and it would have engaged the office and bogged down the

In  other  words,  there  was  an  apprehension  of  the  unreasonable  or  unfair  deployment  of

Chapter 6 | The relationship: the ICO and the pressHcommenting on its justification in this context, this perception is noteworthy in its own right 
not  least  because  it  was  evidently  a  general  perception  within  the  ICO  team.  Mr  Thomas 
recalled a conversation within the office around 2007 along the lines:27

“Thank God we didn’t take the journalists to court. They’d have gone all the way to 
Strasbourg.” In other words, they would have challenged any action we would have 
taken, we would have gone right to Strasbourg, the Court of Human Rights, Article 
10 issues coming in. We’d seen all the material being thrown at us during What Price 
Privacy? and the Bill.”

1.28  There was a gut instinct that litigation against the press would present the ICO with enormous 
difficulties.28 These were evidently perceived to be difficulties over and above the normal 
litigation  issues  of  accessing  and  deploying  evidence,  navigating  the  law,  and  the  overall 
strengths and weaknesses of the case. It can be reasonably inferred from the evidence that 
the perception extended to:

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 

the likelihood of a generally aggressive stance;
the generalised deployment of the rhetoric of freedom of expression beyond the fair 
articulation of balance contained in the law; and
the expectation that that approach would extend beyond the confines of any single case 
of criminal litigation, and even beyond the bounds of any single attempt at regulatory 
action of whatever nature, to a generalised stance of hostility towards the function of 
the ICO as a regulator.

The evidence the Inquiry considered29 suggests that this apprehension was almost certainly 
justified on the basis that the press have a cultural inclination to be defensive and to utilise 
attack as the best form of defence. It was plainly operative. 

1.29  The press, in other words, as an object of regulatory contemplation, was seen as trouble. 
That  is  so  whether  it  was  actively  making  operational  mischief  in  response  to  regulatory 
attention  or impassively declining  to address its  culture, practices and  ethics  itself  (as Mr 
Graham memorably developed the metaphor, “if we’re talking monkeys, it’s see no evil, hear 
no evil.”)30

2.	 The	struggle	for	a	profile:	political	campaigning	and	

2.1 

the power of the press
At  the  beginning  of  this  section  of  the  Report,  reference  is  made  to  the  problematic 
reputation of the data protection regime. This is a burden with which successive Information 
Commissioners  and  their  predecessor  bodies  have  struggled  constantly.  Trying  to  get  the 
issues surrounding data protection to be better known and understood is a vital precursor 
to  improving  compliance  and  standards.  Communication  and  profile  are  in  turn  vital 
components of raising awareness. The ICO needs publicity for its functions. To a degree, it 
needs the press, and therefore has a motivation or predisposition to court it, or at least to 
view it as a potentially ally. To what may be a significantly greater degree, it is also vulnerable

1104

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHto press hostility and suppression or damage to its reputation which can translate directly 
into weakened operational capability.

2.2 

Raising the profile of data protection is an important part of the remit of the office and of 
the personal remit of its figurehead Commissioner. Both Mr Thomas and Mr Graham have 
clearly and commendably shown real commitment to, and significant leadership and personal 
investment in, that very challenging remit. Mr Thomas put it in this way:31

“When I started, data protection had quite a poor reputation. It was seen as a bit 
nerdy, not taken very seriously across many organisations. I think my office probably 
had some responsibility. I used to say that, you know, we were seen outside as the 
temple of data protection and being the high priests of data protection, and I wanted 
to destroy that sort of approach, and therefore I was trying to make us much less 
esoteric,  much  more  avoiding  the  technical  language.  I  mean,  a  data  subject  is  a 
man, a woman, a child, not a data subject. So I took a much more practical down to 
earth approach. Our slogan was that we are here to help organisations who want 
to get it right, but we’ll be tough on those organisations which don’t want to get it 
right…” 

2.3  Mr Thomas also explained his profile-raising function with particular reference to the wider 

role he saw for the two What Price Privacy? reports:32

“I was personally involved in this promotional activity to a very considerable extent. 
The Commissioner – as the personification and leader of the ICO - is obviously expected 
to be a visible part of all major activity. In this case, I attached particular priority to 
the issue and also viewed promoting the reports as a tangible way of fulfilling a wider 
ambition to get data protection taken more seriously.”

2.4 

The potential power of the press as a friend of data protection however, also confronted the 
ICO with an awareness of its potential power as an opponent. Mr Thomas was aware of the 
obvious risk inherent in his strategic response to Motorman by way of the publication of the 
What Price Privacy? reports and the s55 campaign:33

“We  were  aware  from  the  outset  that  the  media  would  probably  ignore  or  show 
hostility to our reports. This presented two problems:

•  The media usually play an important and influential role in any campaign by 
an independent body to secure legislative and other change. In this case we 
anticipated hostility through both editorial and proprietorial influence.

•  We had worked very hard to secure a “good press” for the ICO across a very 
wide range of other DPA and FOI functions and had been largely successful. 
There was a real fear that this could be jeopardised.”

That was a fear which proved to be entirely well-founded. Furthermore, if it was a fear which 
was clearly present in Mr Thomas mind in relation to his strategic and political response to 
Operation Motorman, it does not seem a large step to infer that that was a fear understood 
more generally in the office, not excluding its (more junior) operational staff.

Chapter 6 | The relationship: the ICO and the pressH2.5 

Although the risk of press hostility to the objectives of the ICO was present from the outset, 
it is evident that the sheer scale of the risk and its potential to affect not only the outcome of 
a particular political campaign but the fundamental nature of the relationship between the 
press and the regulator was only a gradual revelation over the months and years. Towards 
the end of his oral evidence to the Inquiry about the course of the s55 campaign, Mr Thomas 
said this:34

“I  think  there  was  a  general  feeling  that  people  at  the  head  of  newspapers  were 
very influential with the politicians and this perhaps was an example of that. And 
although  they rested their case, as I said  just now, on the threats to investigative 
journalism, I was surprised by how hard they were fighting, and it really left me with 
a message that we were challenging something which went to the heart of much of 
the - certainly the tabloid press activity. Someone once said to me: “You do realise 
that  you  are  actually  challenging  their  whole  business  model?”  Maybe  that’s  one 
reason they were fighting so hard, because on the one hand, they were not publicly 
accepting this sort of thing went on. On the other hand, they were fighting very hard 
to avoid the consequences of the law as we saw it.”

2.6  Mr  Thomas  mature  reflections  on  the  lessons  he  learned  from  the  experience  of  the  s55 

campaign are worth pondering in this context:35

“Whatever was precisely known about the nature and extent of press misconduct 
across the industry as a whole, it became increasingly clear that the press were able 
to assert very substantial influence on public policy and the political processes. I have, 
throughout my career, been involved in a wide range of activities where it has been 
essential to attract media attention and, better still, active media support. The ICO 
press team was very effective at giving strategic, tactical and practical advice and 
securing favourable media coverage on many occasions. But, in the matters covered 
by this Statement, the press had a direct interest and a hostile attitude which made it 
very difficult to achieve our objectives. The history of the campaign over the Criminal 
Justice and Immigration Bill … left me in no doubt about the power of the press. I can 
recall saying to my colleagues in 2007 and 2008 that, with hindsight, it may have 
been a mistake on our part to have highlighted press misconduct in our reports. We 
may have made better progress if we had concentrated more on breaches of s55 by 
other sectors.”

Independent	regulation	of	the	press:	lessons	learned
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the ICO did indeed consider itself disadvantaged in 
the task of discharging its functions in relation to the press. That was expressed in a number 
of dimensions which include insufficiency of legal powers, deference to other authorities, 
competing  operational  priorities,  practical  resourcing  and  capability  issues.  Having  said 
that, although each of those dimensions contains important truths, they do not give a full 
account. Despite the abundant evidence, both patent and latent, of problems in the culture, 
practices  and  ethics  of  the  press  in  handling  personal  information,  the  ICO  has  not  been

1106

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHkeen to exercise the powers and functions reposed in it by Parliament in the public interest 
to address the matter. That is not simply a historical matter; it is perceptible in its approach 
today. In a context in which public concern about press standards and respect for the law has 
reached sufficiently acute proportions to warrant the commissioning of a judicial inquiry, that 
must be seen as a regulatory failure within the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry. 

3.2 

It is an understandable failure. The lessons to be learned from the narrative of the ICO and 
the press are entirely congruent with the evidence to the Inquiry of the approach of the press 
more generally. That approach is too often characterised by:

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 

resistance to independent regulation of both law and standards;
a confrontational, aggressive and personal approach to its critics;
powerful behind the scenes political lobbying in its own interests; and
the deployment, through a very loud megaphone, of the rhetoric of the freedom of the 
press to stifle rational criticism and debate about where the public interest lies.

Although it is a failure to which the ICO may be considered to have contributed by reason of 
its own choices, for example by engaging in the political arena on contested policy matters 
to  a  degree  beyond  what  was  likely  to  be  constructive  and  productive,  and  in  relation  to 
operational decision making, I do not attribute it wholly or mainly to the individual leadership 
of the ICO. If, however, there is a perception of inequality of arms in the relationship between 
the ICO and the press, and if it is one which for understandable reasons the ICO has been 
reluctant to articulate or seek to remedy itself, then Mr Owens’ rhetorical question takes on 
certain urgency for the Inquiry:36 

“It’s our job to take them or indeed anyone else on, that’s what we are paid to do. If 
we do not do it then who does?”

The ICO has to be capable of performing its function in relation to the press, however balanced 
and light touch the exercise of that function should be. It keeps wicket in this respect, on 
behalf of the public and at public expense. It does not have an option simply to leave the field 
open. As was observed in recent High Court proceedings, which also took a wider view of the 
ICO’s functions in relation to journalism than it was minded to take itself:37

“there is a need for someone to protect the public.”

The  final  part  of  this  part  of  the  Report  therefore  briefly  identifies  the  structural  and 
governance issues which are likely to need to be addressed to put the ICO in a position in 
which it is capable of discharging its functions in relation to the press. This is at the margins 
of the Terms of Reference but, in the light of the analysis to which the ICO has been subject, 
I have no doubt that it is appropriate to identify the parameters of a solution before leaving 
the matter to the more detailed consideration both of the Ministry of Justice and the ICO 
itself.

reflections	for	the	future	
The legal structure of the ICO is such that the entirety of the functions of the office is devolved 
through the office and the person of the Information Commissioner. The organisation of the 
office (that is to say, the division of functions, decision-making processes, accountabilities, 
staff mix and so on) are matters within the personal discretion of the Commissioner.

In  looking  at  the  issues  raised  in  this  section  of  the  Report,  some  issues  of  governance 
appeared  to  be  raised  by  the  narrative.  In  particular,  the  importance  of  the  connection 
between the strategic leadership and the operational activities of the office, and the question 
of  the  circumspection  that  the  ICO  evidently  felt  and  feels  about  fulfilling  its  functions  in 
relation to the press raised questions about its organisational capability to act effectively in 
this area.

The data protection regime has specific application to journalism, as indeed it does to other 
sectors for which special provision is made in the law. To operate successfully in specialist 
areas, a regulator needs to have access to two forms of specialist knowledge. This includes 
legal expertise in the operation of the relevant statutory provisions, and business knowledge 
of  the  sector  concerned.  In  the  person  of  Mr  Graham,  of  course,  the  ICO  is  currently  led 
by a Commissioner with direct experience in the sector, but it is essential that the relevant 
expertise  is  also  accessible  at  operational  levels.  The  historic  lack  of  direct  engagement 
between the ICO and the industry may not only be a symptom of the ICO’s lack of operational 
familiarity with the press, but also a cause of it. I recommend that the opportunity should be 
taken by the ICO to review the availability of specialist legal and practical knowledge of the 
application of the data protection regime to the press, and to any extent necessary address it. 

A  fruitful  exchange  of  knowledge,  experience  and  perspective  between  the  strategic  and 
operational levels of a regulator such as the ICO is fundamental to the success of both. In 
the history of its engagement on matters relating to the press, I have some questions about 
whether the organisation and decision-making processes of the ICO have been such as to 
support the necessary exchange and that its success in discharging its functions has suffered 
as a result. I therefore recommend that the opportunity should be taken by the ICO to review 
its organisation and decision-making processes to ensure that large-scale issues, with both 
strategic and operational dimensions, such as the intersection between the culture, practices 
and ethics of the press in relation to personal information on the one hand, and the application 
of the data protection regime to the press on the other, can be satisfactorily considered and 
addressed in the round. 

The  model  of  a  single  post  holder  is  not  one  which  is  generally  encountered  in  modern 
regulatory  regimes,  especially  those  whose  responsibilities  extend  to  powerful  business 
sectors. There has in recent years been a fairly general trend away from individual decision-
makers to boards. The Director-General for Fair Trading was replaced several years ago by a 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Board. The DG for electricity and gas regulation was replaced in 
the late 1990s by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (a board in which non-executives 
form the majority), and subsequently the executive role was divided between Chairman and 
Chief Executive. With the creation of Ofcom, the DG for telecommunications was replaced 
with a full board (which spanned other areas); Ofwat made the same transition in the mid-
2000s; and the health regulator, Monitor, recently moved from a combined executive role 
(with board oversight) to separate chairman/CEO roles.

1108

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionH4.6 

There are a number of reasons why the single model has drawbacks: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

It  can  render  an  organisation  particularly  vulnerable  to  pressure  as  its  profile  and 
reputation are focused on an individual personality.
The absence of an effective senior executive board with non-executive input can expose 
the  office  to  a  presidential  style  of  leadership,  with  insufficient  internal  checks  and 
balances to ensure that its overall priorities remain congruent with its statutory functions.
The  absence  of  an  effective  senior  executive  board  can  also,  as  a  simple  matter  of 
business management, mean that priorities, business risks, resources and performance 
are not managed and monitored coherently.

4.7 

The merits by contrast of a formal Board constitution potentially include the following:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

The benefits of collective decision making. This includes being able to bring a range of 
different expertise, experience and mindset to issues of strategy, priority and direction, 
and an enrichment of analysis, debate and perspective as a result.
Firmer discipline can be maintained in decision-making, including the need to proceed 
by  means  of  structured  agendas,  formal  papers  and  recorded  minutes.  This  is  of 
particular importance in relation to decisions not to take action; when such decisions 
are taken individually or informally they are much more likely not to have been made 
from a structured position of strength.
There  are  formal  and  precisely  defined  delegations  and  it  is  beyond  doubt  where 
decisions are to be delegated to the executive as not requiring Board approval.

All of these have a potential to promote collective decision-making as much more transparent 
and  accountable.  Each  decision  will  thus  both  be  more  considered  in  itself  and  more 
susceptible to structured follow-through to specific outcomes.

4.8 

The evidence before the Inquiry suggested that the constitution of the ICO as a corporation 
sole may, in at least some of these dimensions, have risked its ability to discharge effectively 
its functions in relation to the press. Unresolved questions must remain, for example, as to 
whether:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

the informal approach adopted by the ICO to its regulatory functions (partly a matter, 
perhaps, of presiding over a regime struggling for a profile, also possibly a matter of 
personal  leadership  style)  has  contributed  to  a  reluctance  to  bring  issues  to  a  head 
through the use of regulatory powers, and has allowed inaction to be an unremarked 
default within its own structure;
the  tendencies  of  Information  Commissioners  to  see  themselves  as  having  a  major, 
even dominant, outward-facing role with a political or campaigning dimension has been 
at the expense of their ability to provide clear, engaged, understood and accountable 
leadership in the decisions made within their office, to the detriment of the quality 
of those decisions, and has posed some risk to the regulatory reputation of the ICO, 
including in relation to its quasi-judicial functions; and
its current constitution leaves the ICO with insufficient strength to match major business 
sectors with power and influence, such as the press.

4.9 

I recommend therefore that the opportunity be taken by the Ministry of Justice to consider 
amending the DPA formally to reconstitute the ICO as an Information Commission, led by a 
Board of Commissioners with suitable expertise drawn from the worlds of regulation, public 

1109

Chapter 6 | The relationship: the ICO and the pressHadministration, law and business, and that active consideration be given in that context to the 
desirability of including on the Board a Commissioner from the media sector. In making this 
recommendation I do not, however, consider that the recommendations directed to reflecting 
on the governance of the ICO as currently constituted should be delayed in the meantime.

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHChapter 7 
Summary of reCommendationS

1.1 

I  am  conscious  of  both  the  length  and  complexity  of  this  Part  of  the  Report.  For  ease  of 
reference, I have decided to place all my recommendations in summary form at the conclusion 
of this Part rather than to follow the approach I have pursued elsewhere.

I recommend to the Ministry of Justice that:

The exemption in section 32 of the Data Protection Act 1998 should be amended so 
as to make it available only where:1

(a)  the processing of data is necessary for publication, rather than simply being in 

fact undertaken with a view to publication;

(b)  the data controller reasonably believes that the relevant publication would be 
or is in the public interest, with no special weighting of the balance between the 
public interest in freedom of expression and in privacy; and

(c)  objectively, that the likely interference with privacy resulting from the processing 

of the data is outweighed by the public interest in publication.

The exemption in section 32 of the Data Protection Act 1998 should be narrowed in 
scope, so that it no longer allows, by itself, for exemption from:2

(a)  the requirement of the first data protection principle to process personal data 
fairly (except in relation to the provision of information to the data subject under 
paragraph 2(1)(a) of Part II Schedule 1 to the 1998 Act) and in accordance with 
statute law;

(b)  the  second  data  protection  principle  (personal  data  to  be  obtained  only  for 

specific purposes and not processed incompatibly with those purposes);

(c)  the fourth data protection principle (personal data to be accurate and kept up to 

date);

(d)  the sixth data protection principle (personal data to be processed in accordance 

with the rights of individuals under the Act);

(e)  the  eighth  data  protection  principle  (restrictions  on  exporting  personal  data); 

and

(f) 

the right of subject access.

The recommendation on the removal of the right of subject access from the scope 
of  section  32  is  subject  to  any  necessary  clarification  that  the  law  relating  to  the 
protection of journalists’ sources is not affected by the Act.

It  should  be  made  clear  that  the  right  to  compensation  for  distress  conferred  by 
section 13 of the Data Protection Act 1998 is not restricted to cases of pecuniary loss, 
but should include compensation for pure distress.3

1111

HThe procedural provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 with special application to 
journalism in:

(a)  section 32(4) and (5)

(b)  sections 44 to 46 inclusive

should be repealed.4

In conjunction with the repeal of those procedural provisions, consideration should 
be given to the desirability of including in the Data Protection Act 1998 a provision 
to the effect that, in considering the exercise of any powers in relation to the media 
or  other  publishers,  the  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  have  special 
regard to the obligation in law to balance the public interest in freedom of expression 
alongside the public interest in upholding the data protection regime.5

Specific  provision  should  be  made  to  the  effect  that,  in  considering  the  exercise 
of  any  of  its  powers  in  relation  to  the  media  or  other  publishers,  the  Information 
Commissioner’s  Office  must  have  regard  to  the  application  to  a  data  controller  of 
any relevant system of regulation or standards enforcement which is contained in or 
recognised by statute.6

The necessary steps should be taken to bring into force the amendments made to 
section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 by section 77 of the Criminal Justice and 
Immigration Act 2008 (increase of sentence maxima) to the extent of the maximum 
specified  period;  and  by  section  78  of  the  2008  Act  (enhanced  defence  for  public 
interest journalism).7

The  prosecution  powers  of  the  Information  Commissioner  should  be  extended  to 
include any offence which also constitutes a breach of the data protection principles.8

A new duty should be introduced (whether formal or informal) for the Information 
Commissioner’s Office to consult with the Crown Prosecution Service in relation to 
the exercise of its powers to undertake criminal proceedings.9

The opportunity should be taken to consider amending the Data Protection Act 1998 
formally  to  reconstitute  the  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  as  an  Information 
Commission,  led  by  a  Board  of  Commissioners  with  suitable  expertise  drawn 
from the worlds of regulation, public administration, law and business, and active 
consideration should be given in that context to the desirability of including on the 
Board a Commissioner from the media sector.10

PART H | The Press and Data ProtectionHI recommend to the Information Commissioner’s Office that:

The Information Commissioner’s Office should take immediate steps to prepare, adopt 
and publish a policy on the exercise of its formal regulatory functions in order to ensure 
that the press complies with the legal requirements of the data protection regime.11

In discharge of its functions and duties to promote good practice in areas of public 
concern,  the  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  take  immediate  steps,  in 
consultation  with  the  industry,  to  prepare  and  issue  comprehensive  good  practice 
guidelines and advice on appropriate principles and standards to be observed by the 
press in the processing of personal data. This should be prepared and implemented 
within six months from the date of this Report.12

The  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  take  steps  to  prepare  and  issue 
guidance to the public on their individual rights in relation to the obtaining and use 
by the press of their personal data, and how to exercise those rights.13

In particular, the Information Commissioner’s Office should take immediate steps to 
publish advice aimed at individuals (data subjects) concerned that their data have or 
may have been processed by the press unlawfully or otherwise than in accordance 
with good practice.14

The Information Commissioner’s Office, in the Annual Report to Parliament which 
it is required to make by virtue of section 52(1) of the Act, should include regular 
updates on the effectiveness of the foregoing measures, and on the culture, practices 
and ethics of the press in relation to the processing of personal data.15

The Information Commissioner’s Office should immediately adopt the Guidelines for 
Prosecutors on assessing the public interest in cases affecting the media, issued by 
the Director of Public Prosecutions in September 2012.16

The Information Commissioner’s Office should take immediate steps to engage with 
the  Metropolitan  Police  on  the  preparation  of  a  long-term  strategy  in  relation  to 
alleged media crime with a view to ensuring that the Office is well placed to fulfil 
any necessary role in this respect in the future, and in particular in the aftermath of 
Operations Weeting, Tuleta and Elveden.17

The  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  take  the  opportunity  to  review  the 
availability to it of specialist legal and practical knowledge of the application of the 
data protection regime to the press, and to any extent necessary address it.18

The  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  take  the  opportunity  to  review  its 
organisation and decision-making processes to ensure that large-scale issues, with 
both strategic and operational dimensions (including the relationship between the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press in relation to personal information on the 
one hand, and the application of the data protection regime to the press on the other)

1.2 

In  addition  to  addressing  other  concerns,  the  Terms  of  Reference  require  the  Inquiry  to 
examine the relationship between national newspapers and politicians and the conduct of 
each. That this issue should have been considered relevant to an Inquiry into the culture, 
practices  and  ethics  of  the  press  is  a  matter  of  considerable  significance.    It  implies  the 
existence  of  legitimate  questions  of  public  concern  about  the  nature  of  that  relationship 
and conduct, and about the connection between that relationship and the current state of 
press  standards  and  accountabilities.  It  asks,  in  other  words,  whether  anything  about  the 
relationship between the press and the politicians has amounted to ‘part of the problem’ of 
press standards.

In doing so, and in putting these questions before a judge-led inquiry, the Terms of Reference 
required  reflection  on  the  relationship  between  press  and  politicians  in  a  way  which  was 
relevant  to  and  directed  towards  the  issue  of  press  culture,  practices  and  ethics,  and  of 
course to do so in an objective, evidenced, analytical and politically neutral way. That too 
is significant. If there have been failures of public interest in the relationship between press 
and politicians, then our democracy provides ways in which politicians can account for that 
directly to the public. However, if there were failures of what might be called generic political 
culture (a pattern across time and across parties) and if there were failures in the democratic 
mechanisms  for  accountability,  then  the  ordinary  political  means  of  challenging  and 
investigating such matters might not have been effective. The politicians would themselves 
have been, or at least appeared, too close to the problem itself to address it in a way which 
would leave no doubts in the mind of the public.

1.3 

An issue of closeness is at the heart of this part of the Terms of Reference. More specifically, 
the  issue  is  whether  that  relationship  between  politicians  and  the  press  had  become  too 
close in respects which might not have best served the public interest. The Prime Minister 
himself said that he believed that to be the case, first in July 2011 and subsequently when 
interviewed by Andrew Marr on 29 April 2012 when he said this:

“Have we all got too close? Yes. Do we spend too much time on this short-term news 
management agenda? Yes, we do. Should we try and have a better relationship where 
we fight the daily fire fight with the media, but we focus on the long-term change our 
economy needs, our society needs? Yes. And if that comes out of Leveson, great.”

1.4 

To  put  the  matter  in  context  from  the  outset,  however,  it  is  essential  first  to  reflect  the 
overwhelming  evidence  that  relations  between  politicians  and  the  press  on  a  day  to  day 
basis are in robust good health and performing the vital public interest functions of a free 
press in a vigorous democracy, providing an open forum for public debate, enabling a free 
flow of information and challenge and holding power to account.  If there were any doubts 
about that they would have been dispelled by the perceptive insights of both politicians and 
political journalists and commentators among the Inquiry’s witnesses, and by the remarkable 
quantity and quality of contemporary coverage of this module of the Inquiry’s work.

1.5 

Political journalism is one of the most highly-prized aspects of a free press operating in a 
developed democracy. It has often been referred to as the ‘lifeblood of democracy’, invigorating 
the body politic and supporting the effectiveness of democratic accountabilities. It is in this 
area (although not just in this area) that the press performs some of the most essential public 

1117

I1.6 

1.7 

1.8 

interest functions on which we all depend. Some excellent examples were seen first-hand 
during the course of the Inquiry’s deliberations. I make very clear at the outset therefore that 
political journalism is not the focus of this Part of the Report, and indeed the Inquiry has had 
clearly in mind throughout the importance of ensuring that political journalism is fostered 
and encouraged to the greatest degree possible for the future.

This  Part  of  the  Report  is  not  therefore  directed  at  the  relationships  of  everyday  political 
journalism other than by way of background, nor particularly to the issue of press standards 
as they might apply to such journalism. Nor did the Inquiry pursue as a separate issue the 
status of individual politicians as actual or potential victims of media misconduct (although 
in the course of evidence there have been a number of accounts of the impact of personal 
attacks upon politicians by the press and concern about the potential for such attacks). 

The narrative of this Part of the Report explores instead a very different aspect of the closeness 
of the relationship between press and politicians, the one that is in my view most directly 
relevant to the public interest concerns that prompted the setting up of this Inquiry in the first 
place. That is the question of a closeness which may have, or appear to have, impacted on the 
willingness or ability of the politicians to decide matters of public policy about the media, and 
specifically of policy on press standards, fairly and impartially in the public interest.

As I have already said,1 this Inquiry takes its place in responding to the latest in a long sequence 
of spikes in public concern about press standards; this time it is phone hacking. That history 
is also a history of what has been described as failures by the politicians to make appropriate 
responses to those spikes in public concern. The Inquiry has taken a brief but informative look 
at what has happened in the past, with the invaluable privilege of access to the perspectives 
of  many  of  those  directly  involved.  In  doing  so,  it  has  considered  whether  there  was  any 
discernible pattern in that history, and if so whether it was a pattern which could be related 
to a relationship that was ‘too close’.  The historical approach, which is reflected in this Part 
of the Report, is not therefore academic (and certainly does not pretend to any degree of 
historical discipline or originality); but is, as should be expected of an Inquiry of this nature, 
thematic and inquisitorial.

1.9  Module Three of the Inquiry has focused on the more recent manifestations of this issue, but 
it is an issue which I recognise (as has been pointed out) goes back in time very much further 
than that. The fact that I have not heard oral evidence about relations between the national 
press  and  politicians  at  a  period  any  earlier  than  the  middle  of  the  last  century  certainly 
does not mean that I am blind to the very considerable influence which the press barons 
of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are generally agreed to have had on 
politicians. I am well aware from written evidence and other material in the public domain of 
the role in public life which Lords Northcliffe, Beaverbrook and Rothermere had in their day. 
The power wielded in the past by these proprietors, and their influential relationships with 
the politicians of their time, demonstrates that the issues which the Inquiry is now addressing 
are far from new. However, these earlier events are not sufficiently proximate to the current 
culture to merit detailed examination: the primary focus of the Inquiry has been on what 
should happen in the future in the light of what has happened more recently.

1.10  Chronologically,  the  Inquiry  began  its  focus  on  the  relationship  with  evidence  about  the 
acquisition in 1981 by Rupert Murdoch of The Times and The Sunday Times and it has reflected 
on events from then to the present.  To have gone back further would have demanded too 
much  of  any  witness  and  was  highly  unlikely  to  have  added  to  the  understanding  which 
emerged from the oral evidence which itself spanned a period of 31 years. That oral evidence 

1  Part D Chapter 1

1118

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIis, of course, supplemented by documentary evidence some of which goes back considerably 
before 1981.

1.11  From this, a clear pattern has in my view emerged about the relationship between the press 
and the politicians in recent years at the most senior levels of influence. There is of course no 
evidence at all of explicit, covert deals between senior politicians and newspaper proprietors 
or editors; no-one should seriously have expected that there would be. These very powerful 
relationships are more subtle than that, the extent to which interests coincide or diverge is 
more complicated, and the dialogue more sophisticated.  But there can be no doubt that 
within  these  relationships,  some  of  them  having  the  quality  of  personal  friendships  (and 
some of active hostility), there have been exchanges of influence on matters of public policy 
which have given rise to legitimate questions about the trust and confidence the public can 
have that they have been conducted scrupulously in the public interest.

1.12  Care has to be taken in talking about ‘influence’. It is the prerogative of a free and partisan 
press in a democracy to campaign, lobby and seek to influence both public opinion and public 
policy. Where the issues arise is in the nature, visibility and accountability of the politicians’ 
response.  Nor  is  the  existence  of  personal  relationships  and  friendships  at  senior  levels 
between press and politicians anything other than entirely natural and to be expected. The 
issues arise here in relation to the conduct of public affairs in the context of such relationships, 
and in the boundaries between public and private, accountable and unaccountable.

1.13  The pattern which emerges is one in which senior press/political relationships have been too 
close to give sufficient grounds for confidence that fear or favour have not been operative 
factors in the determination and implementation of media policy. That has been the position 
for some years at least. It is not a state of affairs confined to any one political party. 

1.14  This section examines in particular the decision to permit Mr Murdoch’s News Corporation 
to acquire The Times and The Sunday Times; the terms of the Broadcasting Act 1990 (insofar 
as they concerned foreign and cross media ownership) which were such as to permit Sky TV 
to continue in the ownership of News Corporation; the passage of the Communications Act 
2003, in particular the development of its provisions on foreign and cross media ownership, 
which in their final form would not have prevented News Corporation from acquiring Channel 
5; and finally, the bid by News Corporation for the remaining shares in BSkyB which came to 
an end shortly before the Inquiry was set up (and for connected reasons). Evidence on the 
last of these matters brought into sharp focus the pressures, from more than one direction, 
on governing politicians charged with making a decision of great importance to the media. 
In particular, it exposed a formidable and relentless lobbying operation which gave rise to 
serious legal and ethical issues. 

1.15  On more than one occasion during the period under consideration, concerns about the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press surfaced in public debate. However, on each occasion the 
political reaction was not such as to bring about a lasting solution to the problem. As outlined 
earlier in this Report, concern during the late 1980s reached such a level that the then Home 
Secretary commissioned Sir David Calcutt QC to lead a committee which inquired into and 
reported on press standards, highlighting significant areas of legitimate public concern. The 
political response to the first Calcutt Report purported to give the press a final chance to 
put its own house in order before addressing the matter further. The press failed by some 
margin  to  meet  the  challenge,  but  the  establishment  of  the  ‘self-regulatory’  PCC  was  the 
chief exception to a prevalent “do nothing” response from the Government. How and why 
that was so is examined.

1119

Chapter 1 | Introduction I1.16  The PCC was (or at least could have been) a step forward from its predecessor, the Press 
Council. However, it was never endowed by the industry with the full range of powers and 
resources advocated by the politicians by whom it was presented as a credible response to 
public concern. In practice, as is discussed more fully elsewhere in this Report2 irrespective 
of how it described itself or the powers (however limited) that it actually had, it functioned 
principally as a handler of complaints and latterly an advisory body. When concerns about 
press behaviour, and of paparazzi photographers in particular, resurfaced in 1997 with the 
tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, there was some tightening of the Editors’ Code but, 
as the then Prime Minister candidly accepted, he took a conscious decision to manage rather 
than to confront the media, taking the view that to have confronted the press would have 
been an all consuming task.

1.17  There was a further missed opportunity to address press misconduct when the Information 
Commissioner  published  his  findings  about  the  ways  in  which  private  investigators  had, 
in his view, unlawfully obtained confidential data which was then provided to the press in 
circumstances (including the extent of payments made for the data) which provided ample 
grounds  for  profound  public  concern.3  The  Information  Commissioner  recommended 
amendments  to  the  Data  Protection  Act  1998.  In  the  result,  the  political  response  was  a 
further compromise and no effective action. How that came about is also illuminating.

1.18  This  Part  of  the  Report  therefore  begins  by  considering  some  relevant  aspects  of  the 
relationships  between  our  last  five  Prime  Ministers  (including  the  present  holder  of  that 
office) and the press. Political leaders have their own approaches to and experiences of the 
press at a personal level. Personality and individual approach greatly influence the dynamic 
between a Prime Minister and the opinion-makers of the press. This Part reflects on these 
relationships for the insights they offer into what they might nevertheless have in common, 
and into whether any patterns can be said to emerge. 

1.19  This  search  for  patterns  is  an  exercise  which  was  fundamental  to  the  work  of  the  Inquiry 
in this Module. It would, however, be a mistake to think that the Inquiry can or should try 
to solve all of the unresolved questions about the relationship between the press and the 
politicians  at  the  highest  levels  over the  past  35 years.  What  follows, therefore, attempts 
simply and briefly to set out some of the narrative history which seemed to be particularly 
relevant to the Terms of Reference; there is no ambition to be comprehensive or to sit in 
judgment on political history whether past or contemporary, but only to identify the extent 
of the issues relevant to the Inquiry and to reflect on any pointers for the future. If the most 
recent past is considered in the greatest detail, that is, first, because some of these issues 
were prominent features of the context in which the Inquiry was set up and, second, because 
contemporary concerns are inevitably uppermost in the public mind, and have had the least 
benefit of the longer perspective. 

1.20  This  Part  then  canvasses  some  wider  contemporary  political  perspectives.  My  overall 

conclusions and recommendations follow.

1.21  The  Report  addresses  one  final  matter  in  this  Part.  The  public  concern  which  led  to  this 
Inquiry stands at the end of a long line of surges in public concern. Each has been followed 
by a political response which has not adequately addressed that concern. This all has to be 
viewed in the context of press/political relationships which themselves appear to have had 
problematic dimensions. Thus, the approach to this Inquiry also deserves consideration.

the Conservative Years

1.  prime Minister thatcher: 1979-1990
1.1  Margaret,  now  Baroness,  Thatcher  enjoyed  sustained,  substantial  though  not  unqualified 
support from a range of national newspaper titles throughout her tenure as Prime Minister, 
yet she is reputed to have spent little time herself actually reading newspapers:1

“Margaret Thatcher never read a newspaper from one week to the next.”

While titles with a consistent history of leaning to the left of centre were equally consistently 
critical,  those  sections  of  the  press  with  a  history  of  shifting  political  leanings  were  as 
supportive as traditionally Conservative newspapers. In that sense, at any rate, from Lord 
Mandelson’s perspective:2

“Mrs Thatcher was able to call on the virtually uncritical support of both publishers 
and editors.”

1.2 

1.3 

A particular feature of Baroness Thatcher’s era was the strong personal relationship which 
she enjoyed with a number of newspaper proprietors, characterised by mutual respect and 
shared  political  ideology.  Rupert  Murdoch  described  himself  to  be  a  “great  admirer”3  of 
Baroness Thatcher, agreeing that he was on the “same page politically”.4

The  Inquiry  heard  a  consistency  of  opinion  on  this  matter.  Mr  Murdoch’s  title,  The  Sun, 
was described to the Inquiry by Tony Blair as “a major part of supporting Mrs Thatcher”,5 
although  Mr  Murdoch  himself  put  it  more  modestly.6  David  Mellor  QC  observed  that: 
“[Rupert  Murdoch’s]  ...straightforward  right  wing  populist  opinions  made  him  a  soulmate 
for Mrs Thatcher”.7 Sir John Major attributed Baroness Thatcher’s rapport with newspaper 
proprietors to her political outlook:8

“Margaret was probably the most right of centre leader the Conservative Party had 
had for quite a long time, and I think that appealed to the natural instincts of many 
proprietors and editors at the time, and I think support was accordingly offered.”

Andrew Neil, the former editor of The Sunday Times, also described Baroness Thatcher and 
Mr Murdoch as “ideological soul mates”.9 Sir John interestingly connected the bond between 
Baroness  Thatcher  and  these  proprietors  with  their  common  commitment  to  trade  union

reform, to shared views about business (and buccaneering businessmen)10 and the European 
Union, and to popular admiration for Baroness Thatcher’s role in the Falklands War.

Baroness Thatcher’s relationship with many proprietors did not manifest itself in frequent 
meetings with them or their editors. Mr Murdoch firmly denied the suggestion that he had 
consulted  with  her  regularly  on  every  important  matter of  policy.11  Mr  Neil  saw  Baroness 
Thatcher  once  in  seven  years.12  Kelvin  MacKenzie  told  the  Inquiry  that  he  probably  saw 
Baroness Thatcher about twice a year but later confirmed that he did not doubt that she 
wanted his support.13

The  relatively  modest  number  of  meetings  does  not  necessarily  indicate  that  a  friendly 
proprietor did not have access to the Prime Minister. Mr Murdoch was readily received when 
he approached her whilst he was a bidder for Times Newspapers. The result was that he visited 
Chequers for lunch where he briefed her on his bid and his vision for Times Newspapers. The 
acquisition of Times Newspapers is described in detail elsewhere.14

It is easy to understand why Baroness Thatcher enjoyed a good relationship with a number 
of  proprietors  but  more  difficult  to  attribute  any  specific  benefit  for  either  party  to  the 
relationship  itself.  Baroness  Thatcher  enjoyed  a  good  deal  of  positive  media  coverage, 
although even generally supportive titles were sometimes critical (for example, Mr Murdoch 
preferred  to  support  President  Reagan  over  Baroness  Thatcher  when  the  United  States 
invaded Grenada).15 But the explanation for the positive coverage is readily attributable to 
editorial  approval  for  her  policies  and  disapproval  of  those  of  the  Opposition.  There  was 
straightforward  political  alignment  and  an  element  of  straightforward  mutual  personal 
rapport (not to say admiration).

Importantly, it is clear from Mr Murdoch’s evidence, which is corroborated by contemporary 
notes, that he neither expressly asked for nor was expressly offered any favourable policy 
decisions by Baroness Thatcher.16 He was indeed permitted to buy Times Newspapers without 
a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) but this does not appear to 
me to be directly attributable to personal influence. The Prime Minister was not in any event 
the decision maker.17

1.8  Mr Neil suggested that in late 1985, in the run up to the major industrial dispute at Wapping, 
Mr Murdoch went to “square Thatcher”, by which he meant seek an assurance that there would 
be sufficient policing of the dispute to enable him to continue to do business at Wapping.18 
That was indeed the result, but the Government’s stance during the Wapping dispute was in 
accordance with its approach to other industrial disputes (not least the miners’ strike).

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI1.9 

An indication of the influence of Mr Murdoch towards the end of Baroness Thatcher’s tenure 
was provided by Mr Mellor in these terms:19

“By the time Murdoch came to establish Sky, a brave entrepreneurial investment that 
deserved to succeed, and a process I was happy to help along in the Broadcasting Act 
1990, he was used to Ministers doing his bidding, rather than the other way around. 
He was personally charming to deal with, but he was one of the few people, apart 
from  Heads  of  State,  I,  as  a  minister,  had  to  visit  at  his  premises  rather  than  him 
having to schlepp over to the Home Office.”

1.10  There were nevertheless decisions on media policy taken by the Government which went 
against supportive proprietors. News International was not granted a domestic broadcasting 
licence and had to launch Sky, its satellite television service, using a foreign satellite.20 On 
this, the Sunday Times, under Mr Neil, supported Lord Heseltine against Baroness Thatcher.21

1.11  More than one witness suggested that the prospect of honours played a part in Baroness 

Thatcher’s relationship with senior media figures. Alastair Campbell put it bluntly:22

“Margaret Thatcher had much more press support, partly for political and ideological 
reasons,  in  that  most  owners and  editors  are right  wing  and  genuinely  supported 
her, but also because she operated what today would be seen as a corrupt system of 
patronage using the honours system to reward supportive owners and editors”.

1.12  Lord Mandelson did not put it so high:23

“She cultivated and honoured and nurtured editors and journalists very successfully. 
The  relationship  was,  I  think,  relatively  calm  during  her  period.  It  might  not  have 
seemed so calm to her on all occasions ...”

1.13  Lord Grade offered these thoughts on the question of patronage:24

“...we  are  happily  past  the  days  when  the  politicians  of  the  day  used  to  pack  the 
boards  of  the  regulators  with  their  friends  and  supporters,  such  as  my  time  as  a 
controller of BBC One when in the days of then Mrs Thatcher’s government when the 
board of the BBC were packed with her friends. We’ve moved on from then, we have 
a Nolan process ...”

1.14  An issue of interest to the Inquiry was the question of the perception amongst politicians of 
the extent to which newspaper endorsement assists election prospects. Andrew Marr said:25

“There is always a hierarchy of media contacts. For a Conservative minister, contacts 
at The Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, The Spectator and blogs like Conservative home 
are particularly valuable, and likely to be closer; Liberal Democrats will more likely 
turn to papers and blogs read by their activists, and Labour, ditto. Throughout the

Chapter 2 | The Conservative Years IThatcher, Major and Blair governments, the Murdoch stable was always perceived by 
its rivals to have a privileged position.
“This was because of its spread and power as a publishing group, and Mr Murdoch’s 
readiness to use papers such as the Sun to intervene aggressively. But it made close 
social  relationships,  at  Murdoch  parties  or  Oxfordshire  get-togethers,  peculiarly 
disheartening for press rivals” (emphasis added)

1.15  As notable as the active support of much of the press for Baroness Thatcher was its hostile 
attitude to the Opposition. Throughout Baroness Thatcher’s time in office, successive Leaders 
of the Opposition, first Michael Foot and then Neil Kinnock, were the subject of considerable 
adverse press coverage. Writing from the Labour Party’s perspective, Mr Campbell described 
the period as follows:26

“What we do know is that the press [Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock] received was 
hugely biased against them, and in favour of Mrs Thatcher and her Party. Michael 
Foot  had  long  been  derided  by  the  right  wing  media  for  perceived  political  and 
personal shortcomings, the most famous being the alleged disrespect he showed in 
attending  the  1981  Remembrance  Sunday  Service  in  what  was  mythologised  as  a 
“donkey jacket”. But that was but part of a long campaign during which in several 
papers Mr Foot could only be defined negatively. According to the book, Stick it up 
your Punter, the Sun and the Express told freelance photographers covering a Foot 
visit not to bother sending pictures of the Labour leader “unless falling over, shot or 
talking to Militants.” The Daily Mail, under a pre-knighted David English, led a front 
page with a disputed claim that Nissan would “scrap plans for a £50m car plant” 
if Labour won the election. “35,000 jobs lost if Foot wins” screamed the headline. 
I cite this as a typical rather than exceptional example. Labour’s defeat in 1979, and 
a seeming shift to the left, ignited not so much political debate as focus on sinister 
Marxist forces, wrongly ensuring that at times in the public debate Labour’s political 
doctrine was indistinguishable from the Communists’. The Express earned top marks 
from Tory Central Office with a “Spot the Trots” feature of 70 “extremist” candidates, 
among them Neil Kinnock and Robin Cook”.

1.16  Lord Mandelson put it this way:27

“I think what I meant by [horrible and bloody] is that, you know, there has been a 
longer standing trend in the press to mix reporting with comment, and it didn’t simply 
revolve around that period in the 1980s and the 1992 election. I think that what took 
this sort of merging of comment and reporting to a higher level was the more lethal 
cocktail, which I believe that the Labour Party was exposed to, and that was a sort of 
mixture of aggression and inaccuracy, and I think that the Labour Party generally and 
its leader, Mr Kinnock, in particular were the victims of that.
“I think that the press took their gloves off, I think there was a sort of lack of scruple 
or restraint in the reporting of the Labour Party in those years.
“Now I also quite honestly observe in my witness statement that, you know, a lot of 
the damage the Labour Party had done to itself in the early part of the 1980s. We 
weren’t exactly making it easy for people to report us positively or warmly given the 
vote-losing policies, the divisions, the entries into the Labour Party by the far left.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“But by the end of the 1980s, by the time we got to the 1992 General Election, a great 
deal, I would say the bulk of that swamp had been emptied, and that the Labour 
Party had changed and I don’t think we were given the credit for those changes and 
I think Mr Kinnock in particular was on the receiving end of treatment by the media, 
notably but not only News International titles, that was not warranted and was not 
fair”.

1.17  Peter Oborne felt that there had been: “a poisonously unfair media towards Mr Kinnock at 
that time. He didn’t get a fair crack of the whip, and therefore if he tried to sell a policy, 
it tended to get misrepresented.”28 Headlines from this era included: “Glenys the Menace” 
(Daily Mail) and “Kinnock – I back loonies” (The Sun).29

1.18  The  relationship  between  the  Labour  Party  and  News  International  was  particularly  poor 
during this period for another reason: the dispute at Wapping. Labour sought to mark its 
disapproval of Mr Murdoch’s handling of the dispute by cutting off the supply of political 
news to his reporters. As Andrew Grice, formerly the political editor of the Sunday Times, 
put  it:30

“There  was  a  major  industrial  dispute  at  Wapping  in  1986/7.  During  that  period, 
officially at least, the Labour party was not even talking to the Murdoch papers and 
Murdoch paper journalists were banned from any briefings or press conferences the 
Labour party held. So the back cloth was not just difficult relations but no official 
relationships at all”.

1.19  Mr Campbell said that after the Wapping dispute the Labour Party wanted nothing to do with 

the Murdoch papers.31

1.20  A similarly confrontational line was also taken by the Labour Party with TV AM when it was 
involved in an industrial dispute. Adam Boulton explained to the Inquiry how he was unable 
to take cameras with him into the Labour Party conference:32

“...I report that in the context of having been through the TV AM dispute when, at 
the urging of the ACTT, the Labour Party had done precisely that. They had blacked, 
as it was then called, TV AM so we could not take our cameras, for example, into the 
Labour Party Conference of that year so that we – their spokesmen would not appear 
on our programmes. And of course, the immediate effect of that is that it means that 
your offering is weaker than the offering of your competitors, who have full access to 
all the political parties”.

Chapter 2 | The Conservative Years I2.  prime Minister Major: 1990-1997
2.1 

In November 1990 Sir John Major took up office with what he himself described as a quixotic 
approach to the national press.33 He was keen to win their support and closely followed political 
coverage. But he did not seek a close relationship with proprietors and editors. Instead, he 
kept his distance, leaving contact primarily to others, especially his Press Secretary, a post 
held throughout his tenure by a civil servant.

2.2 

2.3 

2.4 

Sir John fared well, initially, so far as newspaper coverage was concerned. The 1992 election 
was  marked  by  fiercely  hostile  coverage  towards  Sir  John’s  political  rival  Lord  Kinnock. 
However,  it  was  not  long  before  sections  of  the  press  turned  their  hostility  towards  him. 
By the time of the 1997 election, The Sun and The News of the World had unequivocally 
transferred their support to New Labour.

The Major years are undoubtedly important for the work of the Inquiry in relation to media 
policy because it fell to Sir John’s Government to consider and respond to the recommendations 
of Sir David Calcutt QC’s reports.34 Many, including Sir John and Mr Cameron, now consider 
that the response of the time amounted to a missed opportunity.

As Prime Minister, Sir John made a conscious choice not to seek a close relationship with any 
part of the media. He did not think it appropriate and, in any event, he did not share a closely-
aligned political ideology or personal affinity with any of the media proprietors of the time. 
In his own words:35

“As Prime Minister, I did not inherit – or seek – a close relationship with any part of 
the media. I did not go out of my way to engage with the press. This was my own 
choice, made in part by natural instinct, and in part because the Black and Murdoch 
press were wedded to a more ideological type of Conservatism than my own. Nor 
did I engage closely with the Maxwell press or other centre or centrist left titles. This 
decision was, to an extent, quixotic, since the press are a daily route to the electorate. 
Nonetheless, a close engagement did not feel comfortable or proper to me and I left 
relationships with the media largely to the No 10 Press Office – then staffed exclusively 
by civil servants – and, where appropriate, the Party machine...I did not offer any 
peerages or knighthoods to any national newspaper proprietors or editors ...”

2.5 

Sir  John  explained  to  the  Inquiry  his  view  that  in  terms  of  democratic  accountability,  the 
best relationship between the media and senior politicians is one of ‘constructive tension’. It 
should be neither too friendly nor too oppositional. In particular, if the relationship becomes 
too close it can become the context for exchanges of self-interest: leaks and stories in return 
for favourable coverage, as Sir John told the Inquiry had happened to an unnamed politician 
during the passage of the Maastricht Bill.36

2.6 

In practice, Sir John did not often meet national newspaper proprietors. He met Mr Murdoch 
on  three  occasions  (in  1992,  1993  and  1997  respectively),  Lord  (Conrad)  Black  on  seven 
occasions and Lord Stevens twice (and attended four social events at his invitation). He did

1126

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansInot meet Robert Maxwell at all, although Mr Maxwell did on occasion telephone No 10.37 
Strikingly, he not only turned down an invitation from Mr Murdoch in August 1993 to attend 
a “special celebration” to mark the launch of new Sky TV channels but also discouraged other 
Cabinet members from attending.38 He met editors and political editors occasionally, typically 
in the presence of his Press Secretary, and usually for the purposes of explaining a particular 
policy.39 He could recall hosting only one press lunch at Chequers, on 3 December 1995.40 
Unlike his immediate predecessor, he did not confer any peerages or honours on national 
newspaper proprietors and editors (although the position was different in relation to regional 
and magazine editors).41

2.7 

The difference of approach was put into this context by Mr Campbell:42

“You see, I think a lot of this started under Margaret Thatcher, because I think that 
newspapers were given a sense of power. The numbers that received the peerages 
and the knighthoods and the sense that they were almost part of her team. I think it 
changed under John Major, and then I think when we were in power, I think that we 
– I think we maybe did give the media too much of a sense of their own place within 
the political firmament when we should have challenged it more”.

2.8 

Lord  O’Donnell  (as  he  now  is),  a  career  civil  servant,  served  as  Sir  John’s  Press  Secretary 
between  1990  and  1994  before  being  succeeded  by  another  civil  servant,  Sir  Christopher 
Meyer. Lord O’Donnell’s brief was to present Government policy on an even-handed basis to 
all members of the media. This approach marked a change from the higher profile approach 
of his predecessor, Sir Bernard Ingham, and was associated with the return of the Guardian 
and The Independent to the lobby. In Lord O’Donnell’s own words:43

“Well, I was told by the then cabinet secretary, Robin Butler, that what he wanted me 
to do in the role as press secretary was to lower the profile of the press secretary – 
as you mentioned, Mr Ingham, now Sir Bernard, had a higher public profile – and to 
establish very clearly the impartiality of the process. Its relationship with the media 
needed to change. At the time when I took over as Press Secretary, the lobby briefings 
had got to a stage where two newspapers, the Guardian and the Independent, had 
exited  the  lobby,  and  my  job  really  was  to  try  and  get  back  to  a  situation  where 
all newspapers could be represented there and felt able to attend, and indeed the 
Guardian and the Independent did come back in to the lobby.
“So it was trying to establish general principles of the Prime Minister’s press secretary 
being there clearly to present, in an impartial fashion, government policy, and to do 
that equally to all members of the media, both broadcast and newspapers.”

Chapter 2 | The Conservative Years I2.9 

The distance which Sir John put between himself and the national press did not prevent his 
Government from paying close attention to the press or from seeking to get their message 
across to the press through briefings. Sir Christopher put it in these terms:44

“...Enormous attention was paid to editors of national newspapers – this extended, 
to a degree, to regional editors, but not much – and so a considerable effort went 
into  courting  them,  bringing  them  around  for  privileged  one-on-one  briefings  for 
example. This was in the early 1990s. I believe that that practice has now expanded 
phenomenally over the years.
“So what it came down to was an exaggerated belief in the influence of the front 
page headline and commentary columns within. There was an absolute belief that 
newspapers  and  their  editors  could  win  or  lose  elections  depending  on  how  they 
reported the stories.
“I personally believe that that influence is gigantically exaggerated.
“So the result was we did pay – we, in Downing Street, did pay a lot of attention, more 
than I thought was necessary, to trying to pull people on board. And of course the 
more you do that, the more demanding the editors and proprietors, in some cases, 
become. So I was always a bit sceptical about that.”

2.10  As  Philip  Webster,  the  editor  of  The  Times  website  and  a  former  political  editor  with  the 
paper, observed in his evidence, Sir John built good relations with the press on his way to 
Downing Street.45 Once in office, between 1990 and 1992, Sir John received press which he 
himself thought was appropriate, and regarded as neither especially supportive nor hostile.46 
That, of course, falls to be contrasted with the extremely negative political coverage that was 
accorded to the Leader of the Opposition during the same period.

2.11  By 1993, the evidence clearly shows that Mr Murdoch’s British titles were writing some very 
hostile, and sometimes very personal, articles about Sir John. A selection of such articles was 
attached to a briefing note which Lord O’Donnell produced for the then Prime Minister on 
18 August 1993.47 Lord O’Donnell suggested in the note that Sir John took the opportunity of 
a forthcoming meeting with Mr Murdoch to communicate to him the matters quoted below. 
In the result Sir John did not consider it appropriate to do so, not least because of the implied 
threat, but the document nevertheless gives a flavour of the level of concern generated by 
the adverse press coverage:48

“Your papers have made matters worse. They have ceased to make rational criticisms 
of policy. They are now simply anti everything and anti me in particular. (see attached 
cuttings.) This is bad for economic confidence and hence, bad for business. Longer 
term political repercussions difficult to assess. Conservative MPs now see no reason 
to  be  helpful  to  media.  [Pressure  growing  over  privacy  rules,  VAT  on  newspapers,

becoming increasingly attracted to them.]“

2.12  Peter Riddell described the coverage of the Major Government as becoming “very hostile”.49 

Mr Webster said this:50

“Well, there were occasions I think where the treatment of certain leaders got a little 
bit – was over the top, I think. I recall newspaper treatment of Neil Kinnock, John 
Major, latterly of Gordon Brown, where it got too personal and in a sense I felt that 
was going a little bit too far. But I don’t regret the passing of the age of deference at 
all. I remember in the late 1960s, when I joined the Times, there was a much more 
deferential attitude of reporters towards politicians. I am rather glad that is all gone.
It’s just in some cases I think the treatment has been just a little bit too personal at 
times.”

2.13  There were probably many reasons for the change in coverage and the maintenance of its 
changed course. Antipathy to the Government’s policies and, in due course, the rise of New 
Labour were probably amongst them. But Sir John’s personal relationship, or rather lack of it, 
with influential media figures of the time was probably also a factor. Mr Murdoch said this:51

“Q.  So  the  support  the  Sun  gave  to  the  Tory  Party.  not  that  it  was  the  strongest 
support, because you, to put it bluntly, weren’t that appreciative of Sir John Major”
“A.  Or his government. Well, we were reading in all the papers of cabinet divisions”.

2.14  Kelvin MacKenzie, then editor of The Sun, said something similar:52

“Q.  First of all, were your relations with or respect for Mr John Major as good as they 
were with Baroness Thatcher?
A.  No, they were – no, we didn’t have a – no, we did not have a particularly good 
relationship. He was no Thatcher, John Major.”

2.15  There was a conflict in the evidence of Mr MacKenzie and Sir John in relation to the content 
of a telephone conversation which both men recalled took place late on Black Wednesday.53 
Whatever the precise course of the conversation, however, it is noteworthy that the editor 
of The Sun was amongst those, including HM The Queen and senior ministers, to have been 
telephoned by the then Prime Minister.

2.16  Sir John put it to the Inquiry that there had developed something of a culture of press hostility 
to his administration, and personal ridicule of him, which resulted in coverage which went 
beyond  vigorous  partisanship,  and  was  not  only  unfair  but  inaccurate  and  misleading.  He 
cited what he considered to be the mischaracterisation of his Back to Basics initiative as a 
moral crusade, certainly a depiction which had serious repercussions for his Government,

the sexual behaviour of a number of Conservative politicians.54

2.17  He also pointed to the caricaturing of the Citizens’ Charter:55

“Similarly, a policy to improve the culture of public services was launched under the 
title “Citizens’ Charter”. This policy was aimed at improving public services, ensuring 
courtesy to the taxpayer who paid for them, and improving the esteem in which public 
servants and public services were held. The press undermined this campaign from the 
outset, through a total misrepresentation of the facts behind it – led by journalists 
who seemed to have no experience of public service and little care for it.” (emphasis 
added).

2.18  Sir John also pointed to a number of examples of unwarranted press intrusion into his private 

and family life. These included the following:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

intrusion by a tabloid title into the family’s holiday home in Portugal to rearrange the 
furniture, take photographs and publish a story; Dame Norma Major telephoned the 
editor to seek an explanation but was told that she and her husband had “no right to 
any privacy”;56
an attempt to blag personal information about his son’s then girlfriend:57
“on another occasion, my office received a telephone call purporting to be from the A&E 
Department of a hospital. The caller explained that my son’s then girlfriend had been 
involved in an accident and that emergency surgery was necessary. However, before 
this could be carried out, it was vital to know whether she was pregnant. Even though, 
on the face of it, this enquiry was clearly an urgent one, before giving any response my 
office made immediate contact with my son’s girlfriend, who was entirely well and in a 
meeting. For the record, she was not pregnant”;
speculative surveillance of his son:58
“In circa 1996/7, my son was followed repeatedly by an individual on a motorbike, with 
a long piece of equipment attached to his bike. My son became very alarmed, since this 
was at a time when Northern Ireland was a much larger security concern than it is today 
and – through his rear view mirror – he believed the equipment might be a rifle. My son 
followed the security procedures he’d been taught to follow, in order to “shake off” his 
pursuer, but to no avail. He therefore continued to drive, and requested assistance from 
the Cambridgeshire Armed Response Unit who flagged down the motorcycle and pulled 
it over. It turned out that the rider was a photographer for the News of the World, and 
the equipment was a telephoto lens. The motorcyclist had been instructed to follow my 
son “day and night”, in the hope of providing a story.”; and

(d)  picture manipulation:59

“Following the General Election of 1997, I was on a private holiday. Following a picnic 
on the beach, I tossed an empty bottle to my wife, who was immediately beside me, 
tidying up. The following day, a series of photographs appeared in one of the British

bottle onto an empty beach, and thus being a ’litter lout’.”

2.19  There was also this from Paul McMullan, the former News of the World journalist:60

“Yeah, I was sent to France – because I’d lived there and worked for an agency for a 
while – to try and track down the woman who took John Major’s virginity. This was a 
while ago. We found her but we couldn’t get a picture of her with her new boyfriend. 
So the idea was she traded in John Major, the Prime Minister, for this French wrinkly. 
I think the cleaner was in the house, so I blagged my way in and pinched it off the 
mantle piece and copied it. I remember at the time Rebekah Brooks said, “No, put 
it back, we’re not allowed to nick stuff!” And Piers said, “No, who cares? Well done. 
We’ll put it in the paper.” Which is what we did.”

2.20  Sir John nevertheless fairly also said this about his personal coverage:61

“Q.  You refer to your disengagement in the first sentence of paragraph 7. Would it 
be fair to say, though, Sir John, that you were very sensitive about what was written 
about you by the press?
“A.  It certainly would be, yes. I wouldn’t deny that at all in retrospect. It’s certainly 
true. I was much too sensitive from time to time about what the press wrote. God 
knows, in retrospect, why I was, but I was...I woke up each morning and I opened the 
morning papers and I learned what I thought that I didn’t think, what I said that I 
hadn’t said, what I was about to do that I wasn’t about to do.”
“So there was a practical need to know what was going on but did I read them too 
much? Yes, I did. Was it hurtful sometimes? Yes, it was. Did I think, it was malicious? 
I think that’s for others to make a judgment about.”

2.21  There  was  a  significant  exchange  between  Mr  Murdoch  and  Sir  John  shortly  before  the 
election. Sir John invited Mr Murdoch and his wife to dinner because he had been urged by 
party officials to “woo” newspaper proprietors. Sir John said this about the occasion:62

“...In  the  run-up  to  the  1997  election,  in  my  third  and  last  meeting  with  him  on 
2 February 1997, he made it clear that he disliked my European policies which he wished 
me to change. If not, his papers could not and would not support the Conservative 
Government. So far as I recall, he made no mention of editorial independence but 
referred to all his papers as “we”. Both Mr Murdoch and I kept our word. I made no 
change in policy, and Mr Murdoch’s titles did indeed oppose the Conservative Party...”

2.22  As Sir John observed:63

“It is not very often someone sits in front of a prime minister and says to a prime 
minister: “I would like you to change your policy, and if you don’t change your policy, 
my organisation cannot support you”. People may often think that, they may often

so it’s unlikely to have been something I would have forgotten.”

2.23  When Counsel to the Inquiry explored the nature of the opposition of Mr Murdoch’s papers 

to his Government at the 1997 election, Sir John said:64

“Q  ...the Sunday Times continued to support the Conservative Party and the Times’ 
position was more equivocal, supporting anybody who happened to be anti-Europe”
A  “Well, may I please have a definition of “support”? If you mean, did they perhaps 
write an editorial saying, “On balance, the least of all evils is the Conservative and 
you had better vote for them”, I think the answer is probably that they did. If you 
mean: was there news coverage day in, day out, morning after morning, weekend 
after weekend, hostile, then I would have to say to you that I think it was. So I think I 
would have preferred to have less of the editorial support and more of the equitable 
news coverage”.

2.24  He did also acknowledge:65

“...After all, they had written about the Conservative Party between 1992 and 1997, 
how could they, in all credibility, have then said, “Despite all we have written over 
the past five years, we actually invite you to vote for these people we’ve been telling 
you are useless for five years”? I think that would have been quite a difficult editorial 
position to take”.

2.25  More than one commentator has perceived a cyclical nature in the relationship between the 

press and Prime Ministers, starting well and finishing badly. Mr Riddell suggested:66

“Recent prime ministers – John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron 
–have all sought close relations with the media, at various levels, from proprietors, 
through editors to political correspondents, during their rise to the top. But, when 
they have been in office for some time, the relationship has soured as media criticism 
has increased, and each PM has complained about the stridency, intrusiveness and 
unfairness  of  the  media.  Both  the  initial  closeness  and  later  disillusion  have  been 
detrimental to the public interest. It would have healthier to have a more distant, 
workmanlike, relationship throughout.”

2.26  Mr Webster agreed:67

“Q.  You describe, rather like Mr Riddell, a circle whereby recent prime ministers and 
you name John Major and Tony Blair as initially having very good relations with the 
press but eventually becoming disillusioned; would you add Gordon Brown to that 
list?

“A.  Yes, I would, yes. I think in all cases they began with good relations. John Major 
built good relations with the press on his way to Downing Street. But he became very 
quickly disillusioned with the press afterwards”.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.27 

It would be perverse to suggest that Sir John’s relationship with the press was ‘too close’ in the 
sense of too friendly, or such as to give rise to perceptions of mutual favour. It was, however, 
certainly  personal.  The  lesson  many  subsequent  politicians  took  from  observation  of  the 
personal destructiveness of the press towards political leaders such as Mr Foot, Lord Kinnock 
and  Sir  John  was  a  complex  one.  In  part,  it  had  to  involve  scrupulous  reassessment  of 
unpopular policy positions. That in itself contained its own complexities: was unpopularity 
with the press the same as unpopularity with the public? How far did the press themselves 
convince the public to dislike a policy, and was that fair or unfair? How should the personal 
dimension of a political leadership position be considered integral to the political? And, most 
of all, what could be done about any of it? For some at least, one of the lessons taken from 
these experiences was that previous relations between politicians and the press had been 
‘not close enough’.

Chapter 2 | The Conservative Years IChapter 3 
New Labour

1.	 The	1992	general	election
1.1 

The  Labour  Party’s  media  strategy  going  into  the  1992  election  campaign  did  not  aim  to 
win  over  hostile  sections  of  the  media  and  was  positively  averse  to  engaging  with  News 
International  (NI)  in  particular.  It  included  some  manifesto  pledges  on  media  policies  to 
which elements of the press were explicitly opposed, including on implementation of the 
recommendations in the Calcutt Report and the establishment of an urgent inquiry by the 
Monopolies and Mergers Commissions into the concentration of media ownership.1

1.2 

There was, in the event, significant negative coverage of both the Labour Party in general and 
its Leader, now Lord Kinnock, in particular throughout the election campaign. Even the victor 
of that election, Sir John Major, described it as both “a pretty crude campaign” against Lord 
Kinnock and “over the top”.2 The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP, a Labour candidate at the election, 
described the experience in his evidence in these terms:3

“Now, what the Sun was doing in the 1992 election was working over each senior 
member of the Labour front bench and this had an effect, and if you were on the 
receiving end of it, it felt like power. It had an effect in my constituency. I remember 
doing an open-air meeting that Wednesday and you could feel support falling away, 
and my majority scarcely moved, although it did not reflect the national swing”.

1.3 

1.4 

At  the  climax  of  The  Sun’s  election  coverage  were  two  particularly  negative  and  personal 
headlines directed against Lord Kinnock. “Nightmare on Kinnock Street” was followed, on 
election day itself, by the headline: “If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain 
please  turn  out  the  lights”.4  As  is  well  known,  Labour  lost  the  1992  election  but  tabloid 
coverage in the years running up to election, and in particular The Sun’s coverage during the 
campaign, has remained the subject of controversy ever since.

Kelvin MacKenzie, then the editor of The Sun, famously proclaimed through a headline after 
the Conservative victory that: “It’s the Sun Wot Won It”.5 Rupert Murdoch distanced himself 
from that; in his own words, he gave Mr MacKenzie “a hell of a bollocking”.6 Mr Murdoch 
said this:7

“I just thought it was tasteless and wrong for us. It was wrong in fact. We don’t have 
that sort of power. I think if you – well, you can’t do it now, but if you go after an 
election  and  you  see  a  newspaper  that’s  taken  a  very  strong  line,  particularly  the

ISun, and ask their readers how did they vote, there would be no unanimity. It may be 
60/40 one way...”

1.5 

Lord  Kinnock,  in  his  resignation  speech  delivered  on  13  April  1992,  blamed  his  defeat  on 
the newspapers which had supported the Conservatives, quoting the former Conservative 
Treasurer who had said that: “The heroes of this campaign were Sir David English, Sir Nicholas 
Lloyd, Kelvin MacKenzie and the other editors of the grand Tory press”. Lord Kinnock warned: 
“This was how the election was won and if the politicians, elated in their hour of victory, are 
tempted to believe otherwise, they are in very real trouble next time”.

1.6 

None of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Inquiry suggested that The Sun’s support 
for the Conservatives had in fact been decisive, although many, especially in other parties, 
thought that it was very influential. Alastair Campbell put it this way:8

“I am not sure if it can be claimed, as the Sun did after the Tories won in 1992, that 
“it was the Sun wot won it,” but there is no doubt in my mind that the systematic 
undermining  of  Labour  and  its  leader  and  policies  through  these  papers,  actively 
encouraged and fed with lines of attack by Tory HQ, was a factor in Labour’s inability 
properly to connect with the public, and ultimate defeat.”

1.7 

The Rt Hon Harriet Harman MP’s analysis was similar: “The Labour Party went on to receive 
extremely hostile coverage from newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch. We then lost the 
1992  General  Election”.9  During  the  course  of  her  oral  evidence  she  made  clear  that  she 
thought that there were also other factors at play: “... I’m sure there were many things which 
contributed to us not getting elected in 1992 over and above the bombardment that we’d 
received from the Murdoch press ...”10

1.8  Mr Straw observed: “Few of us who took part, for example, in the 1992 General Election are in 
any doubt that the Sun’s approach lost us seats. That was their purpose, and it is disingenuous 
for any now to deny this”.11 Even more succinctly: “It did contribute to our defeat. I took that 
as power”.12

1.9 

Sir  John  Major,  whilst  critical  of  the  treatment  of  Lord  Kinnock,  did  not  think  that  it  was 
actually so influential:13

“How much did that affect the election? Labour Party mythology has it that it made a 
huge difference. I don’t actually think so. I think the news coverage in 1992 and 1997 
accelerated a trend that existed. I do not think it changed the result of either of those 
General Elections. I think we would have won in 1992; we would have lost in 1997.”

1.10  Whether  or  not  press  coverage  affected  the  outcome  of  the  election,  it  is  clear  that  the 
experience had an impact on the perceptions of politicians as to the importance of political

Chapter 3 | New Labour Ipress coverage; and those perceptions have subsequently been a key factor in the media 
strategies of political parties. The Rt Hon Tony Blair put it this way:14

“Q.  I return to the issue of spin. I think we agreed that it was borne out of the unfair 
treatment, in your eyes, of Mr Kinnock’s Labour Party, which required a disciplined 
and possibly a ruthless handling of the press. Is that right?
“A.  Yeah, but you see I draw a very clear distinction between what I would say is a 
very tough professional media operation and ruthless handling of the press in the 
sense  of  –  when  I  read  this  stuff  about  how  people  felt  bullied  and  harassed  and 
intimidated and so on ...”

1.11  Mr  Campbell  recounted  an  active  choice  to  change  the  Labour  Party’s  approach  to  what 
he  described  as  the  Murdoch  papers.15  He  described  Rupert  Murdoch  as  the  single  most 
important media figure and said that “it would have been foolish on our part not to have 
sought to build some sort of relationship with him.”16

1.12  Mr Straw said:17

“...once  Mr  Blair  had  come  into  office  in  1994,  we  all  shared  the  same  view,  that 
if humanly possible, without completely compromising ourselves, we should do our 
best to get the papers on side. It was better than the alternative. This was because I’d 
been through 18 years of opposition.”

1.13  Ms Harman, questioned at the Inquiry, offered this perspective:18

“Q.  May  I  sort  of  turn  that  around  and  say,  well,  those  manifesto  commitments 
which we saw in 1992 were singularly absent in 1997, and there was a reason for 
their being absent, which was not to estrange or inflame or otherwise discourage the 
Murdoch press. Is there force in that observation?
“A.  Well, I think it goes back to what Tony Blair said in what became known as his 
2007 “feral beast” speech, is that we, after all those years in opposition and believing 
that we wanted to get into government to do things on the health service and on 
unemployment  and  on  whole  range  of  things,  that  it  felt  necessary  to  do  more 
assuaging, neutralising, courting, that was the decision that was taken, and that did 
feel like it was necessary.”

1.14  Mr Blair put it slightly differently:19

“Between 1994-1997, we did change Labour’s policy on media ownership. However 
it should be remembered that this policy was itself partly a product of the terrible 
relations between the Labour Party and the Murdoch press and the unions and that 
press. My view was and remains that there should be no presumption in favour of 
any media organisation or against it; that foreign ownership should not be regarded

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIdifferently  from  ownership  by  British  nationals;  and  that  the  best  way  of  dealing 
with undue interference through size whether within one medium or across media, is 
through competition policy. So it would be fair to say that had we kept that policy, it 
would have been a problem with the Murdoch press. But there were sound objective 
reasons for changing it. I can’t recall any conversations on it with anyone from the 
Murdoch media.”

1.15  Mr Blair rejected the suggestion, made by Lance Price, who worked first as Mr Campbell’s 
deputy from 1998, and then as New Labour’s Director of Communications between 2000 
and 2001, that the old media policy was quietly dropped within six months of his (Mr Blair’s) 
trip to Hayman Island in 1995, where he met Mr Murdoch, although he readily accepted that 
had he maintained the old policy then: “it would definitely have been a problem with the 
Murdoch media group in particular ...”.20

1.16  He made very clear that he had not wanted media policy to distract him from his agenda of 

wider political reform:21

“...I mean, I’d taken the view I was not going to have the Labour Party coming back 
into power after 18 years with a programme of change for the country and having the 
centrepiece of the programme being issues to do with media ownership. I thought 
that would have been a distraction and wrong”.

1.17  The scale of the distraction which Mr Blair believed would have resulted had he made media 

reform a central plank of his agenda was forcefully put:22

“My view, rightly or wrongly, was that if, in those circumstances, I had said, “Right, 
I’ve decided what I’m going to do is take on the media and change the law in relation 
to the media”, my view is – and I think it’s still my view, actually – that you would have 
had to clear the decks. This would have been an absolute confrontation. You would 
have had virtually every part of the media against you in doing it, and I felt the price 
you would pay for that would actually push out a lot of the things I cared about, and 
although, you know – I think I say towards the end of my statement: although I think 
this is an immensely important question , I mean, I don’t, in the end – not for me at 
any rate, as the Prime Minister, was it more important than the health service or 
schools or law and order.
“...If you take this on, do not think for a single moment you are not in a long, protracted 
battle that will shove everything else to one side whilst it’s going on”.

1.18  Speaking directly about the lessons and experience of 1992, Mr Blair said: “...I went through 
that 1992 election. I remember it. It was etched on my memory, and yes, I was absolutely 
determined that we should not be subject to the same onslaught”.23

1.19  Andrew Grice gave a similar sense of the impact which tabloid treatment of Lord Kinnock had 

and the Labour Party’s strong wish to avoid it happening again:24

1137

Chapter 3 | New Labour I“The Labour party was haunted by the treatment Neil Kinnock received as Labour 
leader  and  they  were  absolutely  determined  not  to  go  through  that  again.  They 
wanted a fair hearing. If they couldn’t get the endorsement they wanted a more level 
playing field; as you know, in the end they got the endorsement”.

1.20  Adam Boulton noted not only the Labour Party’s close attention to the media after 1992 but 
also that the Conservatives later adopted a similar closeness to the press. Asked whether he 
agreed with the words of Mr Blair: “...We paid inordinate attention in the early days of New 
Labour in courting, assuaging and persuading the media...” he said:25

“Yes, I would. As I also say, there was a reason for it, as has been cited elsewhere in 
the Inquiry. The soreness which Labour felt about the 1992 treatment of Neil Kinnock 
and the feeling that they needed to turn the media around if they were going to have 
a chance of getting their message across in 1997, but it struck me reading that again 
how remarkably close that is to some of the remarks that the current Prime Minister 
made last summer”.

1.21  There  was  open  hostility  between  sections  of  the  press  and  the  Labour  Party  during  the 
1980s, most acutely in the Labour Party’s refusal to deal with NI as a result of the Wapping 
dispute. It was to a degree personal. Sections of the press used the power of personal attack 
and deployed both a sustained campaign of negative and aggressive personal coverage over 
a long period as well as a more concentrated burst during the 1992 General Election.

1.22  Labour’s  1992  election  manifesto  contained  policies  which  reflected  (on  Mr  Blair’s  own 
analysis) the poor relationship between Labour and sections of the press, especially NI. The 
pledge to implement Sir David Calcutt’s proposals if self-regulation failed put the party at 
odds with much of the press, and the promise to call for an urgent inquiry by the MMC into 
media ownership were, however principled, consciously oppositional.

1.23 

It  is  worth  repeating  the  real  difficulty  in  determining  precisely what  impact  the  negative 
coverage  of  Labour  politicians  had  on  the  outcome  of  the  1992  election.  People  do  not 
necessarily agree with the opinions which they read in their newspapers, or they may already 
be  of  the  same  view  and  need  no  persuasion.  However,  it  would  be  idle  to  suppose  that 
sustained negative coverage had no effect. It is reasonable to conclude that political coverage 
can influence voting, although it is important not to overstate the degree to which it can or 
does do so.

1.24  Perhaps of even greater importance, and certainly easier to discern, is the impact of the 1992 
election on perceptions about the power of the press to influence the fortunes of political 
parties. A belief that improved relations with the press were vital to future election prospects 
is agreed to have been a cornerstone of New Labour’s approach, a lesson learned from Lord 
Kinnock’s treatment by sections of the press.

1.25  The  impact  of  personally  hostile  media  coverage  is  not  exclusively  a  Labour  Party  issue. 
Conservative politicians also bear in mind the fate of Sir John Major’s Government which, in 
time, came to attract coverage every bit as negative and personal as that which Lord Kinnock 
had endured.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.	 The	1997	general	election
2.1 

On 21 July 1994, Mr Blair was elected as Leader of the Labour Party, heralding a new era in the 
relationship between the Labour Party and the media.26 Mr Blair himself told the Inquiry:27

“... by the time I took over the leadership of the Labour Party, we’d lost four elections 
in a row, We’d actually never won two consecutive full elections in our history ... I 
went through that 1992 election. I remember it. It was etched on my memory and ... 
I was absolutely determined that we should not be subject to the same onslaught ... 
We paid inordinate attention in the early days of New Labour to courting, assuaging 
and persuading the media”.

2.2 

2.3 

2.4 

He described this new era as one of “courting, assuaging and persuading the media”.28 Mr 
Blair confirmed that he met Rupert Murdoch on at least one occasion before becoming leader; 
this was on 15 September 1994 at a private dinner at a restaurant.29 Although Mr Murdoch 
could not recall the dinner, he accepted in evidence that much of what was attributed to him 
by a number of sources sounded plausible.30 From this it may be possible to infer that Mr 
Blair took the opportunity to explain that the Labour Party would not undertake an inquiry 
into cross-media ownership, and also the state of policy on the statutory recognition of Trade 
Unions.31

The new strategy appears to have had almost immediate effect. Within just a few days of 
his election as Labour Party Leader, it was being reported that Rupert Murdoch had stated 
publicly that he ‘could imagine’ backing Blair32 (Mr Murdoch’s evidence was that although he 
did not remember saying this, it was quite possible that he had).33

On  27  July  1994,34  Mr  Blair  appointed  Mr  Campbell  (then  assistant  editor  at  Today,  a  NI 
newspaper)35  as  part  of  his  political  and  election  strategy  team.  Mr  Campbell  played  a 
prominent  role  in  repositioning  the  relationship  of  the  Labour  Party  with  the  press.36  He 
became in due course the Prime Minister’s Chief Press Secretary in May 1997 and on 15 July 
2000 was appointed Director of Communications and Strategy at No 10.

2.5  Mr Campbell himself stated in evidence that, as soon as he was appointed in 1994, he set 
himself the objective of ensuring that Mr Blair did not suffer the same fate as Lord Kinnock.

Chapter 3 | New Labour IThat  this  meant  taking  a  more  strategic  and  proactive  approach  to  communication  and 
relationships with the media.37 He said this about it:38

“In addition to the historic bias against Labour, the Wapping dispute had given rise to 
real bitterness between parts of the media and the Labour Party, to the extent that 
the Party did not communicate with, for example, some of the Murdoch titles. Also 
other titles like the Mail and the Express were so supportive of the Tories, and hostile 
to Labour, that our people tended to avoid them. We changed that approach very 
deliberately. Part of our message was that there was no part of public opinion we 
were afraid of and where we would not take the basic arguments of Labour”.

2.6  Mr Blair appointed Lord Mandelson (then MP for Hartlepool) to manage the Labour Party’s 

general election campaign. Lord Mandelson described his role as follows:39

“Now, part of that was to reassure the media that we weren’t the same Labour Party, 
and that, in a sense, trying to persuade them that we were no longer the toxic brand 
of the 1980s you could describe as an attempt to sort of neutralise, to sort of take the 
roughest edges off their hostility to us”.

2.7 

On 17 July 1995, Mr Blair accepted the invitation of Mr Murdoch and News Corp to attend 
their conference at Hayman Island and to deliver a speech. In evidence to the Inquiry, Mr 
Blair said:40

“...  I  would  strongly  defend  that  decision.  It  is  important  to  understand  that  the 
Murdoch  press  (a)  represented  a  large  part  of  the  media  with  large  numbers  of 
readers i.e. voters and (b) had been viscerally hostile to the Labour Party. The fact is 
I was changing the Labour Party to become New Labour ... The continued hostilities 
between the Murdoch Group and Labour had no rationale to it given our changes and 
the fact that the Conservative Government was running out of steam. Actually, my 
speech held closely to all the policies I believed in”.

2.8 

He added:41

“I had a minimum and maximum objective. The minimum objective was to stop them 
tearing us to pieces and the maximum objective was, if possible, to open the way 
to support. Now, actually, the speech I gave – yes, of course you had to balance it 
very carefully. There’s no policy I changed, and actually in the speech I went out of 
my way – and we were very careful about this – to make sure I emphasised support 
for  minimum  wage,  union  recognition,  pro-European  position,  increases  in  public 
investment, all of which may not have been what they wanted to hear. On the other 
hand, what I felt perfectly comfortable in doing was saying – and this I was perfectly 
comfortable with saying – “This Labour Party is going to be a party of aspiration, not 
merely redistribution. It’s going to be a party that’s going to appeal to the emerging 
aspirant working class. It’s going to be a party that is essentially about creating a 
meritocratic society and expanding opportunity and it’s not going to go back to the 
old ways”. But that was a message I was determined to give to the country.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI...
But what is important, I think, to emphasise ... I actually did have in all the things that 
we were committed to they wouldn’t like. I was also – because I was having to watch 
my other audience as well”.

2.9  Mr Murdoch put it this way:42

“I distinctly recall Mr Blair’s address at our conference on Hayman Island. He spoke 
convincingly of the ability of a new Labour Party to energise Britain. I do recall believing 
that Mr Blair and the policies he advocated could help revitalise Britain, and sharing 
that view with newspaper editors at the conference, who were also impressed by Mr 
Blair’s speech”.

2.10  He also confirmed that he may well have said the following when thanking Mr Blair for his 

speech:43

“If our flirtation is ever consummated, Tony, then I suspect we will end up making love 
like porcupines, very, very carefully”.

2.11  The  different  perceptions  and  perspectives  on  the  dynamics  of  this  interaction  interested 
the Inquiry. Mr Murdoch was keen to impress on the Inquiry a view that all the power and 
influence lay with politicians, but Mr Blair’s evidence and autobiography were very different.44 
He spoke of feeling ‘this pretty intense power’ in the relationship (although Mr Murdoch was 
not mentioned by name in this context).45

2.12  This contrast was particularly striking. Mr Murdoch:46

“As for the ‘value’ to me of these meetings, my view is that if an editor or publisher 
is  invited  or  otherwise  has  an  opportunity  to  meet  with  a  head  of  government  or 
political leader, you go...”

Mr Blair:47

“Again, now, it seems obvious: the country’s most powerful newspaper proprietor, 
whose publications have hitherto been rancorous in their opposition to the Labour 
Party, invites us into the lion’s den. You go, don’t you?”

2.13  Shortly after the Hayman Island speech, on 17 and 21 July 1995, editorials were published in 
The Sun which were broadly supportive; Mr Blair, it was said, “has vision, he has purpose and 
he speaks our language on morality and family life”.48 But Mr Murdoch’s evidence recalled

Chapter 3 | New Labour Ithat the editorials also noted that a number of questions about Mr Blair’s policies remained 
unanswered at that stage.

2.14  Shortly before the 1997 election, Mr Blair wrote two articles in The Sun about the Labour 
Party’s commitment to a referendum on the Euro: “I’m a British Patriot” on 17 March 1997 
and “My Love for the Pound” on 17 April 1997. Mr Campbell recalled that it had been made 
clear to him by the editor of The Sun that, if Mr Blair were to emphasise the point in these 
articles that there would be no entry into the Euro without a specific referendum on the 
issue, and that he understood people’s fears about a so-called European super-state, this was 
likely to be the final piece of the jigsaw before Mr Murdoch agreed that the paper would back 
the Labour Party at the election.49

2.15  Mr  Campbell  and  Mr  Blair  both  emphasised  to  the  Inquiry  that  they  did  not  tailor  their 
policies to seek favour from the proprietor of The Sun. Instead, they sought to highlight those 
parts of Labour Party policies which might appeal to Sun readers.50 Mr Campbell noted, as 
an example, that holding a referendum on the Euro was already official policy long before 
The Sun made the request it did.51 In other words, there was alignment. There were also 
‘concessions in rhetoric’.52

2.16  The landslide victory of New Labour in 1997, and the decisive defeat of Sir John Major, have 
been widely analysed. Policies, personalities and the public mood on the one hand, and the 
press on the other, were all in the same place. The press no doubt both reflected and affected 
public opinion, in immeasurable proportions. Mr Murdoch generally backed the winning side 
(although he also stated that he sought to judge the candidates on the issues, not on whether 
they were likely to win).53 Mr Campbell put it this way:54

“Again,  I  do  not  believe  that  the  papers  swung  the  result,  though  they  may  have 
helped increase the majority because of the sense of momentum we were able to 
gather. I believe the Sun backed us because they knew we were going to win: we did 
not win because they backed us. But it is certainly the case that we very deliberately 
set out to get our voice and our arguments heard in papers normally hostile to us, and 
that this had the positive political impact we sought.”

2.17  Mr Blair was asked to comment on a passage from Chris Mullin’s diaries dealing with the 

dinner between him and Mr Murdoch on 15 September 1994:55

Q.  “If he thinks we’re going to win, he’ll go easy on us, but if he thought we could 
lose, he would turn on us.” He [Mr Blair] added: “If the press misbehave badly during

about what they’re up to, who owns them, the lot.” Then Mr Mullin: “Did you say that 
to Murdoch?” And your answer: “Not in so many words.” Is that an accurate gist then 
of your conversation with Mr Mullin?
A.  I think it is. I mean, as I say, this is going back 18 years or 17½ years now, but 
certainly that was my attitude. I think now, by the way, I would have a slightly different 
view. In other words, I think – there was a view of Rupert Murdoch, which I think Paul 
Keating speaks to the same effect, which is that he just backs the winner. My view 
now is it’s not as simple as that actually. There are very strong political views and 
those actually do come first, I think, or put it like this: they’re equal first, let’s say, with 
whatever interests he feels in being on the winning side or the losing side, and – you 
know, so I’m not – my view of this now is if he’d been persuaded – I mean, it looked 
as if we were going to win, so you didn’t have to be a genius to think we had a good 
chance of winning, although when you’ve lost four a row, by the way, you never think 
it’s that clear. So I’m not sure I would have the same view now about that, but that 
may well have been what I said to Chris and to – and yes, look, if I’d ended up in a 
situation where they turned on me, I would have had to fight back. You know, there’s 
no – that would have been the only recourse. And we weren’t – in 1992, we weren’t 
really in a position where we were able to fight back, but this time we would have”.

3.  prime Minister blair: 1997 – 2007
3.1  Mr Blair took an early step, by way of the Civil Service Amendment Order in Council 1997, to 
appoint Mr Campbell to an unprecedented position, a political or Special Advisor role with the 
power to instruct permanent civil servants.56 An indication of the considerable importance 
attached to news management strategies in the early years of the administration, it proved in 
the end to have been a highly controversial step, which has not been subsequently repeated. 
Lord O’Donnell viewed the matter in this way:57

“... [this amendment] blurred those lines between what a special adviser does and 
what civil servants do, and I think, with the benefit of hindsight, it didn’t work as well 
as it should have done because it created the idea that the civil servants were obeying 
some rules by someone who was politically appointed, which meant that they also 
would be politically biased, and so it ... I don’t think it was a good idea. I was very 
pleased when it was abandoned, and I did advise that it should be abandoned, and 
that’s very good. I don’t think it’s an experiment we will try again, I hope”.

3.2  Mr Blair himself observed with the benefit of hindsight: “in the event, apparently, we didn’t 

need [it]”.58

3.3  Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that many of the other changes relevant to relations between 
Government and the media made by Mr Blair during his time as Prime Minister were designed 
to ensure that politics, and media coverage of it, was more ‘on the record’, in an effort to 
make politics more accessible to the public.59 These included ‘lobby’ briefings both being put 
on the record and made available online, monthly Prime Ministerial press conferences, and 
the agreement that Mr Blair would attend select committees in addition to answering Prime 

56 In the result, only two such Special Advisors were appointed

Chapter 3 | New Labour IMinister’s Questions. These changes addressed the more formal aspects of the relationship 
between the press and politicians; not all of them were popular on the press side. Adam 
Boulton said:60

“After 2003 Tony Blair attempted to restore media relations by establishing regular 
monthly news conferences. He honoured these punctually even when the chosen date 
coincided with a ’crisis’. However, they were never popular with the press who felt the 
electronic media benefitted disproportionately and neither Brown nor Cameron have 
continued with regular extended news conferences.”

3.4  Mr Blair articulated his overall strategy in this way:61

“My view was this: I, as say, took a strategic decision that this was not an issue that 
I was going to take on ... when I came to office ... there was a whole set of things we 
wanted to do. My view, rightly or wrongly, was that if in those circumstances, I had 
said ‘Right, I’ve decided what I’m going to do is take on the media and change the 
law in relation to the media”, my view is that – and I think it’s still my view actually 
– that you would have had to clear the decks. This would have been an absolutely 
major confrontation. You would have had virtually every part of the media against 
you doing it, and I felt that the price you would pay for that would actually push out 
a lot of the things I cared more about”.

3.5 

He added:62

“We’d ... been out of power for 18 years. We got into a rhythm which is very much the 
rhythm of opposition. So we were still, as it were, campaigning, you know, in the first 
few months, possibly the first year of government, but frankly after that time, you got 
into a proper rhythm of government and we had a very strong media operation...”.

3.6  Mr Campbell said:63

“I don’t make any apology for the changes we made in opposition because they helped 
us to win. I don’t make apologies for the changes we made in government because 
they helped us to communicate more effectively and I think that helped the Prime 
Minister to govern more effectively. What I do accept is that at times, we probably 
were  too  controlling,  that  at  times  we  did  hang  on  to  some  of  the  techniques  of 
opposition when we should have dumped them at the door of Number 10, but I’d also 
ask you to bear in mind the sheer volume of issues we were expected to deal with, be 
on top of. 24/7 media means just that. You are dealing with this 24 hours a day at a 
time when, in my case, also trying to be in charge of overall strategy as well”.

3.7 

The issue which has been much analysed subsequently is the extent to which the transition 
from  Opposition  to  Government  ought  properly,  in  the  public  interest,  to  be  reflected  in

1144

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIdistinctive and observable differences in the conduct of relations between politicians and the 
press. As Lord Mandelson put it:64

“Because of the particular and specific public duties of a minister, and the requirement 
for these to be carried out in a transparent and accountable manner, my strictures 
would apply more to government than opposition politicians, but not exclusively. And, 
of course, the circumstances of a minister’s job are very different from opposition. 
The intensely scrutinised fishbowl world of government places incredible demands 
on the time, energy and focus of those who inhabit it. Ministers have less and less 
time in the day for policy deliberation and formulation because of media (as well as 
parliamentary) demands. On the other hand, politicians – ministers in particular – 
have greater opportunities than ever to communicate directly with electorates.”

3.8  Mr  Blair’s  Government  enjoyed  a  ‘honeymoon  period’  with  the  press;  Mr  Campbell 

summarised the trajectory in this way:65

“Though the press largely turned against him at various stages of his premiership, 
and some continue to campaign relentlessly against him even now, we did have a 
fairly benign media environment for some years, and by the time they turned, most 
of the public knew him well enough to have a fairly settled view”.

3.9 

And, in Lord Mandelson’s view:66

“I think Mr Blair ... rescued and made good Labour’s relations with the media. I think 
he was two or three years into government and they started taking a further dive, 
and climaxed, in a way when they became their worst at the time of the Iraq War”.

3.10  The personal dimension of the relationship is, again, an interesting one. Mr Blair took the 
view that, as time wore on, he, and more particularly his family, were often unfairly subjected 
to personal intrusion and attack. Although the Blairs were friendly with the Rothermeres, he 
cited the Daily Mail as being, from his perspective, particularly personal in this respect. He 
said:67 68

“The fact is, if you fall out with the controlling element of the [newspaper] ... you are 
then going to be subject to a huge and sustained attack. The [newspaper] for me – 
they’ve attacked me, my family, my children, those people associated with me, day 
in, day out, not merely when I was in office but subsequent to it as well. So that is – 
and they do it very well, very effectively, and it’s very powerful ... With any of these 
big media groups, you fall out with them and you watch out, because it is literally 
relentless and unremitting once that happens and my view is that what creates this 
situation in which these media people get a power in the system that is unhealthy and 
which I have felt, throughout my time, uncomfortable with”.

Chapter 3 | New Labour I3.11 

In May 1997, the relationship between Mr Blair and Mr Murdoch was not close; they had 
only met on a handful of occasions and there were references in Mr Campbell’s diaries to 
Mr Blair’s ambivalence about such meetings (“...he felt that there was something unpleasant 
about  newspaper  power  and  influence”),  although  he  recognised  their  importance  and 
value.69 The relationship grew closer although, on Mr Blair’s account, did not develop into 
personal friendship until after 2007 by which time he had left office.70

3.12  Lord Mandelson’s evidence was along these lines:71

‘It is also arguably the case, however, that personal relationships between Mr Blair, 
Mr Brown and Rupert Murdoch became closer than was wise in view of the adverse 
inference drawn from the number of meetings and contacts they had.’

3.13  Mr Blair did not accept that his relationship with Mr Murdoch was too close in that sense. He 

spoke more generally of the danger of relationships which were ‘unhealthy’; he said:72

‘...but the relationship is one in which you feel this – this pretty intense power and the 
need to try to deal with that...’

that is to say by managing rather than confronting it,73 by building a relationship with Mr 
Murdoch and others within NI. This entailed meetings and contact in private as well as in an 
official context.

3.14  Mr  Blair’s  relationship  with  Rebekah  Brooks  may  well  have  been  warmer,  when  he  was 
in  power,  than  his  relationship  with  Mr  Murdoch.  Although  Mr  Blair  was  careful  to  point 
out that Mrs Brooks was not a key decision maker within the company,74 he accepted her 
characterisation of him being ‘a constant presence’ in her life.75 Mr Blair also accepted that, 
after his third election victory in 2005, both Mrs Brooks and Mr Murdoch were a sympathetic 
pair of ears in an increasingly hostile media landscape.76 As with Mr Murdoch, Mr Blair said 
his personal friendship with Mrs Brooks did not really develop until after he left office: as he 
put it, when free from the constraints of power.77

3.15  Both Mr Blair and Mr Campbell emphasised to the Inquiry that, viewed objectively, there 
were many aspects of the Government’s media policies which ran contrary to the interests 
of NI:78

‘I mean, if you just look at the big policy decisions we took, the biggest in the media 
sphere is probably the rise of the BBC licence fee. They weren’t terribly happy about

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIthat. Ofcom, I think Mr Murdoch said in his evidence, not terribly happy about that. 
He tried to take over Manchester United and was blocked. The digital switch, there 
were  differences.  ITV,  Channel  5  –  there  were  lots  of  areas  where  you’d  be  hard-
pressed to say that the Murdochs and the Murdoch businesses were getting a good 
deal out of the Labour government.’

3.16  Again, although the party changed its policy in relation to the Euro notwithstanding Mr Blair’s 
sympathy in principle with the idea of entering the single currency, the fact that the eventual 
Government  position  aligned  with  Mr  Murdoch’s  is  explicable  by  reference  to  very  many 
objective factors.

3.17  The  perception  of  influence  has,  however,  been  a  persistent  point  of  debate.  In  March 
1998, Mr Murdoch confirmed to The Times that he had requested Mr Blair to ask the Italian 
Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, whether the Italian Government would allow Mr Murdoch to 
acquire Mediaset, Italy’s leading commercial television network. It should be noted that Mr 
Murdoch’s intention was not that Mr Blair seek to persuade his Italian counterpart to waive 
the bid through, in obvious contravention of EU and domestic law, but rather that Mr Blair 
ascertain whether it was worth his making a formal bid, given that he was not an Italian or EU 
national. The acquisition did not in the event proceed.

3.18  Mr Blair confirmed that he did speak to Mr Prodi about Mr Murdoch’s proposed acquisition of 
Mediaset, but that the call had come from Mr Prodi himself and had not been initiated by Mr 
Blair. He said he had asked about the proposed acquisition, and Mr Prodi had communicated 
to him that he wanted an Italian purchaser for Mediaset. Mr Blair explained that he would 
have done the same for anyone with substantial British interests:79

“...  the  call  was  initiated  from  Romani  Prodi,  and  basically  I  ...  raised  the  issue  of 
whether the idea of having someone from the outside come and own part of Mediaset 
would be resented or not. He gave me an answer and I can’t remember how it was 
relayed back, but I’m sure it was. But my point is that I would have done that for 
anyone with substantial British interests. I would have done that if another media 
group had asked me to do it.”

3.19 

In his evidence, Mr Campbell quoted a contemporaneous No 10 briefing he had given on the 
issue, and added:80

“The  call  from  Prodi  was  not  about  [the  proposed  acquisition]  ...  It  was  about 
something completely different, and Prodi had asked for us not to brief on it... Rupert 
Murdoch had mentioned this company to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister, 
as I recall – we did have a discussion about whether there was anything wrong in him 
raising it. In the end he didn’t raise it until this phone call came along on something 
else and he mentioned it and Prodi said words to the effect that Murdoch’s wasting 
his time and I don’t think it went any further”.

3.20  Whether Mr Blair would have telephoned Mr Prodi to intervene on Mr Murdoch’s behalf 
had the latter not telephoned him first on another matter is unclear. In any event, taking full

Chapter 3 | New Labour Iwhat may be more important is what can be inferred from the fact that Mr Murdoch was able 
to ask the Prime Minister to make the enquiry in the first place.81

3.21  The war in Iraq was a landmark event in Mr Blair’s political fortunes. Some commentators82 
have argued that Mr Blair’s decision to go to war in Iraq was influenced by Mr Murdoch’s firm 
and enthusiastic views on the subject. Mr Blair rejected that suggestion:83

“I disagree completely with Paul Dacre’s assertion over Iraq. I had a view about this 
issue. I was prepared to lose a vote and resign over it. I had taken a position since 
9/11 to stand with the US. I strongly believed it was right to remove Saddam Hussein. 
It is correct I spoke to Rupert Murdoch in the days leading up to the vote. I can’t recall 
at whose instigation. I would have obviously wanted to explain what I was doing and 
why to the Head of Media Group that was most disposed to support the action; but 
I had long since made up my mind on it and the notion that I required “lobbying” by 
him or anyone else is plain wrong. And I have no doubt that the Mail would have 
attacked me whichever course I took”.

3.22  Mr Blair was asked by the Inquiry about three telephone calls made on 11, 13 and 19 March 

2003 in the run up to the Iraq War. He said this:84

“Look, this is a huge issue, obviously. I mean, my recollection is that I initiated one 
of those calls. I actually remember only two, but the records show there were three, 
although I think they were no more than 45 minutes in total for all three. But you 
know, I would have been wanting to explain what we were doing, and I did this – I 
think I had similar calls with the Observer and the Telegraph, and indeed I had a lunch 
later with the Guardian. So you know, I think that’s – it’s not – I wouldn’t say there’s 
anything particularly unusual or odd about that when you’re facing such a huge issue.
Now none of these calls was particularly long, but they were important... I think with 
him, probably, I would also have been asking him what the situation was in the US, for 
example, in Australia, which were also major parts of the coalition. But no, it would 
not have been about the tone of the coverage. I mean, look, they were supportive of 
it and that was that”.

3.23  Although Mr Blair did not have a clear recollection of the precise content of these calls (and 
nor did Mr Murdoch when asked about them), it is interesting that he made time to discuss 
these issues with a newspaper proprietor speaking from the USA. It is also interesting that Mr 
Murdoch’s 173 newspapers worldwide all supported the war.

3.24 

In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Blair explained that although he had considered throughout 
his period of office that, while he had views about press conduct and standards, addressing 
them was not a priority, by the time he had come to the end of his term as Prime Minister he 
had concluded that the issue had become far more pressing.85 On 12 June 2007, approximately 
two weeks before leaving office, Mr Blair gave a speech on Public Life to the Reuters Institute 

81 It may not be an uninteresting parallel that Mr Murdoch felt able to contact Mrs Thatcher, the then Prime Minister, 
at the time that he was seeking to acquire The Times and The Sunday Times

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIof Journalism, in which he made some trenchant criticisms of the press, famously describing 
at least sections of the industry as ‘feral beasts’.

3.25  He made four specific points:86

“The  media  is  increasingly  and  to  a  dangerous  degree  driven  by  ‘impact’...  First, 
scandal or controversy beats ordinary reporting hands down. News is rarely news 
unless it generates heat as much as or more than light. Second, attacking motive 
is far more potent than attacking judgment. It is not enough for someone to have 
made an error of judgment. It has to be venal. Conspiratorial ... But misconduct is 
what has impact. Third, the fear of missing out means today’s media, more than ever 
before, hunts in a pack. In these modes it is like a feral beast, just tearing people and 
reputations to bits. But no one dares miss out. Fourth, rather than just report news, 
even if sensational or controversial, the new technique is commentary on the news 
being as, if not more important, than the news itself”.

3.26  He suggested that the “relationship between public life and media [was] ... now damaged in 
a manner which [required] repair”, that “a way needed to be found” to ensure that the press 
remained  accountable,  and  that  serious  concerns  about  unbalanced  reporting  would  be 
addressed in the future. He noted that broadcasting, for example, was regulated by Ofcom.87

3.27  The speech was almost universally criticised by the press itself. The Daily Telegraph on 13 
June  2007,88  carried  a  headline  “Blair’s  Last  Enemy:  Freedom  of  Speech”  above  an  article 
which, while accepting that some of the points that Mr Blair had made were valid, considered 
his call for reform would “impair freedom of speech and the liberties of the subject...[and] 
eventually make them obedient to the government of the day”, and concluded that “... we do 
find his argument deeply disturbing, founded on false premises and worthy of the strongest 
refutation”.89

3.28  A Mail Online article of the same date was headlined “The Magnificent Self-Delusion of Mr 
Blair”.90 It also rejected the idea of statutory regulation, describing such thoughts as “decidedly 
sinister” and suggested that it was odd for Mr Blair to ‘attack’ the press in this way, as he had 
“enjoyed for most of his years as Prime Minister a more approving and more docile press than 
any British leader in living memory”. It went on to assert that “for the most part, the media 
acted like a great sloppy Labrador which repeatedly bestowed its affections on Mr Blair”.91

3.29  A  Guardian  leader  of  13  June  2007  was  headed  “Right  Sermon,  Wrong  Preacher”.92  It 
considered the speech to be a “heartfelt homily” which “deserved a serious response”, but 
noted that “it is pretty rich to be lectured on such matters by this prime minister who, more 
than  any  other,  has  marginalised  parliament  through  a  combination  of  sofa  government, 
selective leaking and sophisticated media manipulation”. The article concluded:93

Chapter 3 | New Labour I“It has been a consistent pattern – witness terror briefings to the Sunday newspapers. 
Truly, he helped feed the animal he now wants to chain”.

3.30  Mr Campbell confirmed that the issue of addressing press standards had been discussed in 
2002 and 2003 but not pursued.94 In an article in the Guardian published in July 2011,95 Lord 
Mandelson reflected that ‘we were cowed from reforming the media’.

4.	 Prime	Minister	Brown:	2007	–	2010
4.1 

The Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP was Prime Minister between 27 June 2007 and 11 May 2010. 
Mr Brown was asked to comment on the strategy New Labour adopted in the mid-1990s; he 
said:96

“My efforts were to persuade every media group that what we were doing was serious. 
Look, we were trying to rebuild the National Health Service, improve our education 
system, get more police onto the street, legislate for freedom of information. We had 
agendas on civil liberties, on issues like gay partnerships. All these issues, you needed 
to have an understanding, at least, on the part of the media, and you needed to talk 
to them. As for any particular media group, I don’t think I was involved in any sort of 
way that I would feel uncomfortable about now with any particular media group at 
all.”

4.2  Mr Brown said that he had few dealings with Rupert Murdoch at this stage, and by implication 
that  close  engagement  with  the  press  was  left  to  others.97  He  also  stated  that  he  had  no 
involvement in  what he called  the ‘particular issue’ of winning  the support  of The Sun  in 
March 1997.98

4.3  Mr Brown said that he had intended from the start of his premiership to set a new tone in the 
Government’s relationship with the press. He explained that he was concerned to ensure fair 
access to Government, including by meeting regularly with all media groups without giving 
preferential treatment to anyone.

4.4  Mr Brown’s evidence, however, was that he faced a hostile press almost from the very outset, 

and that the hostility came to be of a very personal nature. Lord Mandelson said:99

“Mr. Brown comes in and he has good, rather easy relations with the media. It didn’t 
last, as we know. It took a very significant dive”.

4.5  Mr Brown described his initial approach:100

“When I came in in 2007, we had no mandate in our manifesto to propose reform 
of the media. I did want to make a change, and I did try to move away from what I

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIthought was the excessive dominance of what is called the lobby system, and what 
really has led to these allegations of spin … I tried to move away from that.
One, we moved away from having a political chief of communications to having a 
civil servant doing the job. That was to send a message that we were not trying to 
politicise government information; we were trying to give the information that was 
necessary for the public to understand what was happening.
We  then  tried  to  move  back  to  a  system  where  announcements  were  made  in 
Parliament. They were not pre-briefed, they were made in Parliament, and therefore 
that moved away from a system where, to be honest, there were a selected group 
of people who previously could expect to get early access to information, and I think 
that’s been a problem with the way the media system has worked, but I’m afraid it 
was wholly unsuccessful, and I see that the current government have moved back to 
having a political appointee … and the lobby system remains intact. It’s not the lobby 
system per se that’s the problem, it’s this small group of insiders who get the benefit 
of early access to information, and I think that is one of the problems that prevents 
the greater openness that we have to see.
… The changes that eventually we tried to make we didn’t make successfully I’m afraid 
because  there  was  a  huge  resistance  to  them,  and  to  be  honest,  if  you  announce 
something  in  Parliament  or  announced  it  in  a  speech,  it  was  not  being  reported. 
Unless it had been given as an exclusive to a newspaper, they tended to put in on 
page 6, rather than page 1.”

4.6 

In relation to changes to the lobby system, Mr Boulton commented:101

“... Under the Brown and Cameron governments there has been a concerted attempt 
by  press  colleagues  to  use  the  Lobby  system  to  constrain  their  competitors  in  the 
electronic media by imposing  artificial  embargos on information given in order to 
benefit print deadlines. This practice is particularly irksome on foreign trips in different 
time zones and has resulted in several calls to ban Sky News for allegedly breaking 
the rules. Downing Street habitually takes the side of print on the pathetic ground 
that ‘we’ve got to give the hacks something to justify the cost of the trip.’”

4.7 

In June 2007 the personal relationship between Mr Brown and Mr Murdoch was said to be 
close,  and  appears  to  have  become  so  over  the  preceding  years.  However,  by  September 
2009 it had cooled, associated with a shift in political support in The Sun. As Lord Mandelson 
explained:102

“Q:  You  presumably  detected  that  shift  in  support,  which  was  gradual,  from  Mr. 
Brown to Mr. Cameron; is that right?
A:  Yes. That was during 2009. Yes, during the course of that year.
Q:  Had you seen signs of it the previous year in 2008?
A:  It was hard not to get Rebekah Wade, or Brooks, as she became, to wax eloquent 
about the inequities of Gordon Brown and the so-called coup against Tony Blair. She 
had strong views. I remember on one occasion ... she tipped into this great tirade 
against Gordon and these others who had brought Tony down and whatever, and

1151

Chapter 3 | New Labour IMr. Murdoch said ‘For goodness sake Rebekah, can’t you let history be history? Let 
bygones be bygones. Let’s not go into that anymore.’”

4.8 

Lord Mandelson’s focus was on the personalities involved, but Mr Brown chose to emphasise 
what he called NI’s public agenda:103

“News International had a public agenda. What’s remarkable about what happened 
in the period of 2009 and 2010 is that News International moved away from being 
–  I  think  it  was  under  James  Murdoch’s  influence,  not  so  much  Rupert  Murdoch’s 
influence, if I may say so – to having an aggressive public agenda ... I don’t think I 
had a conversation with Mrs. Brooks in the last – I think I had one conversation in 
the last nine months of our government. It became very clear in the summer of 2009, 
when Mr. Murdoch junior gave the MacTaggart lecture, that News International had 
a highly politicised agenda for changes that were in the media policy of this country, 
and there seemed to me to be very little point in talking to them about this”.

4.9 

In terms of his personal relationship with Mr Brown, Mr Murdoch expressed the matter in 
this way:104

“I felt a personal connection with Gordon Brown. He is Scottish, as was my grandfather, 
and we spent time discussing the fact that we are both descended from a long line of 
Presbyterian ministers. He gave me a lovely gift, a book of his father’s sermons. My 
wife and his also developed a friendship, and my children and his played together... I 
certainly thought we had a warm personal relationship.
...
My personal feelings about Mr. Brown did not change my view that, just as I had 
earlier concluded that the Conservative Party had grown tired in its approach in 1995, 
I concluded in 2010 after 13 years of Labour Party rule the country needed a change. 
I am afraid that my personal relationship with Mr. Brown suffered after The Sun no 
longer supported him politically. I continue to hold him in high personal esteem.”

4.10  Mr Brown’s evidence was as follows:105

“Q:  Mr. Murdoch himself describes a warm relationship he had with you. Is this a fair 
characterisation?
A:  Yeah, I think the similar background made it interesting because I think I understood 
where many of his views came from, and I do also think he’s been, as I said ... a very 
successful businessman, and his ability to build up a newspaper and media empire, 
not just in Australia but in two other continents, in America and Europe, is something 
that is not going to be surpassed easily by any other individual. But I think you have 
to distinguish again between the views that you have about him as an individual and 
the red line that I would draw, the line in the sand I talked about, between that and 
any support for commercial interests ...”
Q:  Were  you  not  concerned  at  ...  the  signs  of  The  Sun  moving  away  from  you  to 
support the Tory Party?

1152

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIA:  I  think  that  happened  from  the  time  I  became  Prime  Minister.  I’ll  be  honest.  I 
think they had severe reservations that were expressed in the European campaign, 
the Broken Britain campaign, their Afghanistan campaign, and I think, as I said, also 
there was a new agenda that Mr. James Murdoch was promoting about the future 
of the media policy in Britain. So I was not surprised at all when The Sun – I was 
perhaps surprised about the way they did it ... but the act of deciding to go with the 
Conservatives, I think, had been planned over many, many months.”

4.11  On a personal level, Mr Brown was also quite close to Mrs Brooks and his wife, Sarah, was 
described as a good friend. In the context of coverage of his son’s medical condition, which is 
considered above,106 Mrs Brooks explained:107

“You have to remember that the – this is 2006. This is only five years later that Mr Brown 
had ever said anything – that he was in any way concerned about my behaviour, the 
behaviour of the Sun, how we handled it. Indeed, after 2006, I continued to see them 
both regularly. They held a 40th birthday celebration party for me. They attended my 
wedding. I have many letters and kind notes. Sarah and I were good friends...”

4.12  Neither  Mr  Brown  nor  Mr  Murdoch  accepted  that  their  relationship  had  been  ‘too  close’ 
during Mr Brown’s time as Prime Minister, nor that NI had provided support for Mr Brown 
or  his  Government  in  its  newspapers  on  the  express  or  implied  basis  that  the  company’s 
commercial  interests  would  be  safeguarded  or  wider  political  agendas  espoused.  Asked 
about this, and whether there could even have been legitimate concerns about perception, 
Mr Brown told the Inquiry:108

“No, because the implication is that I would be influenced by Mr. Murdoch was saying 
about these big issues. I mean, I thought that it was wrong to join the euro ... but I 
didn’t agree with him on most of these other issues, and the idea that Mr. Murdoch 
and  I  had  a  common  bond  in  policy  is,  I’m  afraid,  not  correct.  Mr.  Murdoch  was 
probably more on the flat tax school of policy than in the school of policy that was 
identified with what we were doing.
...
I have never asked a newspaper for their support directly and I’ve never complained 
when they haven’t given us their support. I don’t think you should be dependent on 
people by begging them to support you in this way, and perhaps it’s a failing on my 
part  that  I  never  asked  them  directly,  but  I  never  asked  them  directly  and  I  never 
complained to them directly when they withdrew support from the Labour Party”.

4.13  The issue of the so-called ‘pyjama party’ held at Chequers to mark Mrs Murdoch’s fortieth 
birthday has, however, been cited as evidence of a legitimate cause of concern about the 
blurring of relationship boundaries between the personal and the conduct of public affairs. 
Commentators such as Mr Boulton spoke of this in extremely critical terms:109

“Well, I think you can be blamed with hindsight if a lot of people think it looks wrong, 
and  –  you  know,  the  famous  Wendi  Deng  pyjama  party,  for  example.  I  remember

Chapter 3 | New Labour Ia then member of the cabinet telling me about that at the time and I just thought: 
“This is completely bonkers that this sort of intimacy is being indulged in between 
the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Prime  Minister’s  wife  and  a  senior  proprietor’s  wife”, 
and I thought at the time, you know, it will end in tears. But we all find ourselves in 
social circumstances or awkward social circumstances which we perhaps have been 
recruited for, which we didn’t seek out but we’ve ended up in.”

4.14  Mr Brown described himself as having been unfairly and personally hurt by an attack in The 
Sun following the publication of a handwritten letter he had sent to the mother of a soldier 
killed in Afghanistan. Email correspondence between Mr Brown and Mr Murdoch ensued,110 
following a telephone conversation which took place on or about 10 November 2009.111

4.15  A number of commentators have suggested that Mr Brown had enjoyed a close relationship 
with Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre and that, although their political perspectives differed, they 
shared similar values. About that he said this:112

“A.  I didn’t see Mr Dacre that much, as you can see from the records. Mr Dacre and 
I  disagreed  about  many  things  on  politics.  I  think  he,  like  me,  believes  that  there 
should be an ethical basis for any political system and that that is an issue that is not 
properly addressed both in our media and in our politics, so there is sort of common 
ground on that, even though we may disagree about what that means in practice. 
He was personally very kind, as Rupert Murdoch could be personally very kind, when 
we had difficulties with our child, our first child, and I have not forgotten that. But to 
be honest, I got no support from the Daily Mail. The Daily Mail was totally against 
the Labour Party, and when it came to the election, you may see that I had a meeting 
with Lord Rothermere, as I talked to Paul Dacre, and I said, “Look, you’re entering a 
situation where you have a party that’s got a relationship with the Murdoch empire 
and their commercial interests and you should be very wary of it”, and I did warn 
them that that was one of the problems that was going to happen.
Q.  Some  have  said,  including  Mr  Alastair  Campbell,  that  the  Daily  Mail  was  less 
hostile to you personally when you were chancellor, owing in part to your position on 
the euro. Do you think that’s a fair comment or not?
A.  I don’t know whether it was. Look, one of the huge dividing lines in British politics 
over the past 10 years has been the euro. Most of the newspapers, of course, were 
against it. I was in a minority within our government for a very long period of time of 
being sceptical about the euro. My colleague, Ed Balls, who was the economic adviser 
to the Treasury at the time and was later a Member of Parliament, did this enormous 
amount of work that proved to my satisfaction that the euro couldn’t work, but it 
was a hugely divisive issue. But if the Daily Mail supported the objections that I had 
to the euro, then that’s absolutely understandable, but I’m afraid to say on just about 
every other issue they were wholly against us and they wanted to see a Conservative 
government, as you know.”

4.16 

In his oral evidence Lord Mandelson explained his perspective in this way:113

1154

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Q:  Did he become an ally of Mr. Dacre or vice versa?
A:  He was, much to our astonishment, incredibly close to Mr. Dacre. I’m not saying 
that  it’s  wrong  to  be  a  friend  of  Mr.  Dacre;  I  too  sometimes  enjoyed  Mr.  Dacre’s 
company. I enjoyed his company more than his treatment of me in his newspapers. 
But he – Gordon and Paul Dacre had a great friendship and I remember Paul Dacre 
describing to me the virtues of Mr. Brown in contrast to Mr. Blair in fairly graphic 
terms. And that continued, actually. Even when Gordon, as Prime Minister was, you 
know, having a really tough time, you know, following the financial crash and what 
happened to our economy as a result of the financial crash, and the Mail and the 
Mail on Sunday would be laying into the Labour government left, right and centre, 
there was always an element, an element, of laying off Mr. Brown and so I think that 
friendship continued.
Q:  Did that friendship, in your view, have any influence on Mr. Brown’s political and 
policy thinking, particularly in the context of Europe?
A:  I think Mr. Dacre’s influence in their friendship would have accentuated his cooling 
on Europe and the single currency, but that was by no means the only influence. A far 
greater influence would have been his economic adviser and minister throughout the 
period, Ed Balls...
Q:  Do you think Mr. Brown had an eye on the Daily Mail, Mr. Dacre’s view, in terms 
of policies for which he was responsible?
A:  As Prime Minister, he was responsible, in a sense, for all policies. I’m not sure. 
In  mean,  the  only  thing  I  can  vaguely  remember  was  something  to  do  with  data 
protection. There was an issue to do with data protection.”

4.17  Mr Brown was asked a number of questions about alleged anonymous briefings to journalists 
which it was put to him were in fact given by Charles Whelan and Damian McBride, who 
worked for him as his special advisors, the former until 1999 and the latter until April 2009. 
Mr Brown denied that they gave any such briefings, or that if they did so it was without his 
knowledge or sanction.114

4.18  Many political commentators have expressed surprise at this evidence. The current Leader of 
the Opposition has said that the reason Mr Whelan left his position was ‘because of the style 
of his operation’, and that he had raised a specific concern with Mr Brown about some of Mr 
McBride’s activities.115

5.4 

A thread running through a quantity of the evidence to the Inquiry about the relationship 
between politicians and the press was the issue of the extent to which politicians attempted 
to affect (or, put less neutrally, to manipulate) press coverage in their favour, not this time 
at  the  level  of  personal  interactions  or  potential  interchanges  of  influence,  but  simply  by 
seeking to control what information is released about their thoughts and plans, when, how 
and to whom.

This is an issue of interest to the Inquiry, first because it offers the prospect of insight into 
the dynamics of the relationship and, in particular, where power lies. To the extent that a 
politician can control the news agenda he or she is in a position of relative dominance in 
the relationship. It is also of wider interest from the viewpoint of the general public interest 
because it has a potential to affect the clarity with which the public can understand what is 
going on and the ability of political journalists to do their job of promoting free debate and 
holding power to account. It has a potential to have results which are partial, misleading, 
distorted or placed out of context. On the other hand, it also has the opposite potential, 
namely  to  counteract  whatever  tendencies  might  exist  in  the  press  to  drive  the  political 
agenda, if not public opinion, in any particular direction.

It is an issue which is accordingly very hard to deal with objectively. It largely comes down 
to a matter of standpoint. It is therefore dealt with relatively briefly in this Report. I have 
nevertheless concluded that there are some interesting patterns which can be picked out, 
and perhaps one or two lessons which can be drawn.

The issue probably owes its contemporary prominence to the critique of ‘spin’ associated 
with the news management techniques of Lord Mandelson and Mr Campbell.117 Both, when 
invited by the Inquiry to do so, painted a picture instead of a need to counteract unfair press 
hostility.

5.5  Mr Campbell’s role was certainly one that trod new ground in the history of relations between 
politicians  in  Government  and  the  press.  Some  commentators  described  it  as  a  wholly 
different  approach  to  the  imparting  and  presentation  of  information  from  Government. 
Others  take  a  longer  view.  The  Rt  Hon  Michael  Gove  MP  was  able  to  remind  the  Inquiry 
of historical parallels with the Roman Republic.118 Lord Mandelson suggested that the first 
‘spin doctor’ was appointed by Clement Atlee, and that Baroness Thatcher’s press spokesman 
when she was Prime Minister, Sir Bernard Ingham, was as high profile and controversial as 
Mr Campbell.119

5.6 

Sir John Major provided the Inquiry with an illuminating perspective on these issues:120

“Now, we’ve had political spin forever. Every politician since the dawn of time will 
put  a  gloss  on  something  to  ensure  that  it  is  presented  in  the  best  possible  light. 
We’ve all done it. Everyone does that. But I think there is a distinction between a gloss 
and a deliberate attempt to deceive in the way in which the news is presented, and 
my concern was that once you move towards the politicisation of the government 
information services, which is what it was, you did move into a sphere where the

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansInews could be perverted rather than presented accurately and without spin to the 
media at large.
I think you also saw some other things which journalists are better able to talk about 
than I, but that they’ve certainly mentioned to me: people being given stories when 
other people weren’t and presenting them with a particular tilt, so that when the 
story hit the public news, immediately it had a favourable tilt for the government 
rather than a neutral or perhaps even a deservedly unfavourable tilt. A whole range 
of things like that, which I’m sure this Inquiry has heard about, so I won’t tediously 
run through them all. But in short, I think the straightforward, clear cut certainty of 
an honest presentation of policy from the information service that was there when 
you had civil servants presenting it on behalf of the government was lost when you 
moved to a political information service.

5.7 

The New Labour perspective
As  indicated  above,  on  27  July  1994,  Mr  Blair  appointed  Mr  Campbell  to  be  his  press 
spokesman and jointly responsible with Lord Mandelson for election strategy.121 It was put 
to Mr Campbell that Mr Blair’s memoirs had referred in terms to the value of appointing a 
tabloid editor,122 an assessment which he only partly accepted:123

“No,  what  he  said  to  me  when  [he]  finally  approached  me  was  that  he  wanted 
somebody that was strategic, that understood the press and that would be able to 
do  the  job  that  he  wanted  done.  So  I  don’t  recall  it  being  particularly  he  wanted 
somebody who was from the tabloids, but he wanted somebody that kind of knew 
that world.”

5.8  Mr Blair’s own perspective was as follows:124

“I cannot believe we are the first and only government that has ever wanted to put 
the best possible gloss on what you’re doing. I would be surprised if governments 
hadn’t done that throughout the ages. That is a completely different thing from saying 
that you go out to say that things that are deliberately untrue or you bully or harass 
journalists and so on. I read a lot of things we are supposed to have done. I actually 
dispute we did those things, very, very strongly. My view is this: I totally understand 
why there’s a kind of symmetry in being able to say, “Oh, well, the government was 
spinning and so the media had to react to that”. In my view – but you can take a 
different one – that’s not what happened.
I mean, the truth is, in 1992 Alastair Campbell wasn’t heard of. If you look at the way 
that election was covered – and by the time I took over the leadership of the Labour 
Party, we’d lost four elections in a row. We’d actually never won two consecutive full 
elections in our history. The longest we’d ever been in power was six years at one go. 
So – I went through that election. I remember it. It was etched on my memory and yes, 
I was absolutely determined that we should not be subject to the same onslaught.”

Chapter 3 | New Labour I5.9 

Lord Mandelson was asked directly about his news management strategy and the label of 
‘spin’. His explanation was as follows:125

“I think ‘spin’ is a derogatory term. I mean, what we determined to do, really from 
the time that Tony Blair became leader of the Labour Party in 1994, was to speak as 
far as possible with a consistent voice, and to – perhaps to go back to your earlier 
question, to try to ensure that the media understood what it was that we were trying 
to achieve. So yes, I mean, there was more discipline about what we said, how we 
said it, who we said it to, than there certainly had been through the many years of 
Labour in opposition.
Q:  Did it lead to a breakdown of trust between the public on the one hand and the 
politicians on the other?
A:  I don’t think it was – I don’t think it was that that led to a breakdown of trust in 
the public. I do think that we were always too reliant on the support of newspapers, 
and I think that in the context of everything I’ve said earlier ... our expectations were 
too high of the degree to which the government’s story could be conveyed through 
the newspapers.”

5.10  Mr Campbell’s personal, retrospective evaluation was that the critique of ‘spin’ was itself a 
symptom of the problem which he thought he faced, and that suggestions that the quality of 
public discourse was corroded were rarely supported by evidence:126

“I can remember, for example, one briefing where, at the end of yet another frenzy 
and journalists accusing me of lying and the politicians then getting roped in saying 
I  should  resign  –  I  can  remember  saying  to  all  the  journalists  there  in  the  room: 
“Right, come on, just say what the lie is and then provide any evidence whatsoever”. 
And  they  never  could!  So  just  –  that  in  itself  is  a  form  of  spin.  You  sent  me  Peter 
Oborne’s essay that he did for the British Journalism Review. “Most lobby journalists 
[he said] have been deliberately misled or lied to by Downing Street”. Followed by 
zero  evidence  whatsoever.  “New  Labour’s  culture  of  deception  or  manipulation  of 
statistics, secretive smear campaigns....” No evidence whatsoever.”

5.11  Mr Campbell was also asked about Lord Mandelson’s views:127

“Q:  Lord Mandelson, one of his concluding observations – ...
“There was a great emphasis on managing the media at the expense of managing 
policy. There was a sense that if you’d got the story right, you’d achieved something 
and that’s not how government is.” Do you think there’s any validity in that comment?
A:  No. I think the policy process was always taken more seriously, but I think we all 
spent far too much time focussed on – and I speak as the guy who was in charge if 
this. The politicians spent way too much time worrying about this stuff.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.12 

Interestingly, there are perhaps echoes of this in Mr Cameron’s public statements in April 
2012 about wider failings in politics: the concentration on presentation over the content of 
the message itself.128

5.13  Mr Blair’s evidence was along similar lines. He accepted that there were problems in the 
carrying over of the techniques of Opposition into Government. He also accepted that Mr 
Campbell was somewhat of a ‘combative figure’. Asked about whether there had in fact been 
bullying or intimidating of journalists, or alternatively the favouring of certain journalists, Mr 
Blair stated:129

“If you take someone like Andrew Marr, who is a very good journalist, I would be 
astonished if he felt that he’d been bullied or intimidated. If he did feel that, then I’m 
sorry about it, and I certainly wouldn’t have known about it. .... But I suspect he is 
feeding back this thing that has grown up. You know – and also, some of these issues 
are different. For example, there will always be an interaction with the newspapers. If 
you’re going to launch a major campaign, and let’s say there’s a particular newspaper 
that’s been interested in this type of campaign – let’s say you were going to do a 
big  thing  on  anti-social  behaviour.  It  would  make  sense  to  talk  to  the  Mirror,  the 
Sun, maybe, about that. We probably, in the later part, would have hesitated before 
talking to some of the papers that were utterly hostile for fear of the fact that you 
would simply have the story distorted in some way, so maybe that gives rise to that.
Briefing against people – I just want to make this clear: I couldn’t abide that. If I ever 
thought anyone was doing it, I would be absolutely down on them like a ton of bricks. 
I remember, for example, stories – I remember there were a lot of prominent stories 
at a certain point in time in relation to the late Mo Mowlam, and how I was very 
angry because she got a standing ovation at a party conference and we were briefing 
against her ... It was completely untrue.
...
Q:  I think the thesis being advanced is that the masters of the dark arts, whether 
they be Lord Mandelson or Alastair Campbell, tended to pick on junior reporters or 
producers... and let off people like Mr. Marr himself.
A:  No, that’s my point, really, that in the end they receive this as sort of second-hand 
– look, I have no doubt that we used to complain strongly if we thought that stories 
were wrong. You know, I think that’s perfectly legitimate. But I always felt – and I’m 
probably not the right person to be objective about this at all – but I always felt that 
their actual pushback against us was because for the first time, the Labour Party ran 
a really effective media operation, where we were able – and also, by the way, we 
were in circumstances where, for the first time politically, the Labour Party was able 
to go on and win successive elections. As I said earlier, we’d never won two successive 
first terms, never mind three, and I felt you had to have a strong media operation, but 
I completely dispute that it was part of that to go and brief against ministers”.

5.14  Towards the end of his evidence was this interesting series of answers from Mr Blair:130

Chapter 3 | New Labour I“Q.  If, as I think you are not, you are not accepting even a kernel of truth in a thesis 
which may be exaggerated, how is it that this mythology has built up around you that 
people like Lord Mandelson, Mr Campbell, at your instigation, were the masters of 
these so-called dark arts?
A.  It’s got to the point where I almost hesitate to dispute it with you, because I know 
these people just say, “Oh, how dare he dispute the fact that actually they were out 
using black arts and briefing against this person and that person?” The fact is, you 
know,  I  never  authorised  or  said  to  someone:  “Go  out  and  brief  against”  –  I  hate 
that type of stuff. It’s the lowest form of politics. It’s just a complete diversion from 
everything that is important. Now, I don’t doubt, by the way – look, in any system you 
will have people that will say things or do things or brief things that they shouldn’t be 
doing, but I simply say to you my view is that the – what I think a part of the media 
felt – and this is the odd thing, and I used to comment on this sometimes – is that 
to the outside world, when you’re Prime Minister, you seem as if you’re all powerful, 
and for that first period of our time in government, it looked as if we were carrying in 
everything. You know, the opposition were very poor, we didn’t just win one landslide, 
we then went on to win two, and I think part of the media frankly felt we were far 
too powerful, we had to be taken on and curbed and so on. But, you know, in relation 
to this stuff with black arts, look, I don’t – I don’t know whether Peter was doing it 
or Alastair was doing it, but if they – all I know is that my interactions with them, 
we were aware that you start doing all that stuff, all it does is blow back on you. I’m 
a real believer in this regard that what goes around comes around. So for me, the 
important thing was to have a strong effective media operation. I think that what 
Alastair produced for us in Downing Street was that, but I think it was a perfectly 
proper media operation.
Q.  I’m really coming back to the point about the draining of the poison, and perhaps 
who is responsible for the implantation of the poison. If one focuses too much on the 
press, it might be said that one is arguably missing the wrong target. How about this 
as a possibility: we might have now a poisonous state of affairs which is a contribution 
really of both sides to this equation – the press on the one hand, the political classes 
on the other – and accidentally or unwittingly, they’ve created something which has 
grown beyond either of their contributions. Is that a possible analysis?
A.  Look,  it’s  certainly  a  possible  analysis,  and  I’m  not  saying  we  don’t  bear  any 
responsibility for this situation – don’t misunderstand me – as a political class, but I 
think if I’m frank about it, the primary responsibility is not having confronted it and 
dealt with it.”

5.15  Mr Brown offered this perspective on his personal approach:131

“I did want to make a change, and I did try to move away from what I thought was 
the excessive dominance of what is called the lobby system, and what really has led 
to those allegations of spin – by the way, spin assumes that you got success in getting 
your message across, even if it’s superficial and I don’t think anybody could accuse 
me of having a great success in getting my message across. But I tried to move away 
from that.
One, we moved away from having a political chief of communications to having a 
civil servant doing the job. That was to send the message that we were not trying to

1160

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIpoliticise government information; we were trying to give the information that was 
necessary for the public to understand what was happening”.

5.16  Mr  Brown  did  suggest  that  there  had  been  risks  to  the  public  interest  in  New  Labour’s 
approach to news management. Asked if there were any lessons to be learnt from the period 
1997 to 2010, he indicated:132

“Yes. We should have ... changed the system where people relied on exclusive briefings 
and had a far more transparent system of addressing the country through the press 
than we have even today, and I obviously have to take some responsibility for this ... 
So yes, there needed to be more openness. We inherited a system which was based 
on, if you like, exclusivity. It was also based on insiders winning over outsiders, so a 
lot of people were excluded from that system”.

5.17  From one standpoint, then, the priority of the politicians learning the lessons administered 
to  them  by  the  press  in  the  ‘wilderness  years’  of  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  was  both  to 
persuade  the  press  that  they  had  nothing  to  fear  from  a  change  of  Government  and  to 
reach the public in a less adversely mediated way. From another standpoint, this was at the 
expense of a breakdown of public trust engineered by political self-interest. For politicians 
trying to manage the agenda, it was about getting a fair hearing; for journalists resisting the 
management of the agenda, it was about manipulation and favouritism. Neither standpoint 
is  neutral  or  objective.  In  the  relationship  between  press  and  politician,  in  circumstances 
where political positions are not aligned there is a contest of wits (or megaphones) in which 
each viewpoint seeks to outmanoeuvre the other in a contest to dominate the public debate. 
Sometimes that can benefit and enrich the public debate and a balanced perspective can 
emerge.  Sometimes  it  can  have  the  opposite  effect: the  public  is  so  overwhelmed  by  the 
messages delivered by competing megaphones, it does not have the chance to sort the wheat 
from the chaff or to discern the true kernel of the issue.

5.18 

If New Labour did not invent ‘spin’, it nevertheless found itself in an unprecedented place 
in relation to news management as an agenda item in its own right. On the one hand, its 
election-winning strategy in 1997 explicitly had in mind the lessons to be learned from the 
recent past. On the other, there is an obvious question about the extent to which a media 
strategy of ‘neutralising’ those sections of the press which had been hostile to the party in 
the 1980s and in the run-up to the 1992 general election became a victim of its own success, 
and resulted in diminishing public confidence in political communications.

The perspective of journalists and commentators

5.19  Andrew  Marr  offered  this  overview  in  his  book  “My  Trade”,  from  his  long  perspective  of 

political journalism in the print media and more recently working for the BBC:133

“... As trust crumbled, so did reporters’ willingness to defer to the government. Tales of 
how New Labour had bullied junior reporters or producers spread through the warren 
of press gallery offices and between broadcasters’ headquarters. The backlash was 
slow,  but  it  came.  By  the  end  of  Blair’s  first  two  years,  it  was  a  badge  of  honour 
to be ‘bollocked’ by Campbell or Mandelson, and to shout back just as loudly. The 
persistent attempts to dictate what should appear on a front page, or at the top of a 
running order, became infuriating and hardened journalistic hearts.

1161

Chapter 3 | New Labour IEven before the 1997 election it was obvious that Labour had spies tipping it off about 
running orders, script lines and correspondents being used for news programmes and 
was  attempting  to  ambush  them  before  they  went  on  air  to  get  more  favourable 
coverage.  In  lobby  meetings,  Alastair  Campbell  and  others  would  single  out  and 
ridicule the correspondents of editorially hostile newspapers ... Favoured reporters 
were given special treatment, just as their editors were made much of in Downing 
Street and invited to weekends at Chequers.
But political correspondents have a certain esprit de corps alongside their professional 
rivalry, and the cynical way in which some were favoured because they worked for 
Rupert Murdoch, while others were sneered at because they worked for Conrad Black, 
disgusted many who worked for neither.”

5.20 

In oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Marr was asked to expand on this final paragraph. He said 
this:134

“I think that a decision was taken that it was very important to keep the Murdoch 
papers, so far as was possible – it wasn’t always possible – on side and to have a 
close  relationship  with  their  leading  journalists  and  their  leading  reporters.  They 
were inside of the tent, if you like, as were some Labour friendly newspapers too, 
while papers like the Daily Telegraph were indeed kept at arm’s length, made to feel 
unwelcome. From time to time their correspondents like George Owens [sic] would be 
mocked during lobby briefings. There was very much an attempt, I felt, to divide this 
core – this group of journalists into the favoured ones, the ones who were sort of part 
of the project, almost, and the ones who were off in the wilderness.”

5.21  Peter Oborne, chief political commentator at the Daily Telegraph, also commented on this 

issue from his own perspective. He observed as follows:135

“Q:  I’m going to read the opening quotation of chapter 7 of your book ... The Quotation 
is from Robert Shrimsley, who is the news editor of the Financial Times, and it reads: 
“When I joined the lobby in 1992, I would abandon a story if Number 10 denied it. By 
the time I left, I sometimes felt justified in merely recording the denial at the bottom.”
A:  Yes.
Q:  How accurate a summary is that of the change in government communications 
during that period?
A:  I completely agree with Mr. Shrimpley136 ... I felt that what was true – I think what 
we had when New Labour emerged in power in 1997 was really a – what I’d call a 
new epistemology, which was that truth was really seen as something which served 
the purposes of government or the party in power. It wasn’t – the rigorously testable, 
empirical truth was of no interest – of a kind which would be of interest to this Inquiry 
– was not of interest to New Labour spokesmen. They were interested in the truth as 
it served their political purposes, and so that was a different definition of truth. That, 
I think, is what Mr. Shrimpley137 is referring to there that denials or assertions became 
really an instrument of government rather than an instrument of telling the truth.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.22  Simon  Walters  is  the  political  editor  of  the  Mail  on  Sunday,  a  position  which  he  has  held 
since 1999. He has been a journalist since 1974 and a member of the lobby since 1983. In his 
written evidence, Mr Walters noted that: 138

“During Mr. Blair’s government, much energy was devoted to ensuring all departments 
were ‘on message’ – repeating the Downing Street line on any given issue. From the 
point of view of the Government, this greater degree of political control makes sense. 
But it can be argued that this is not in the public interest or that of the media. For 
example, if Number 10 is trying to cover up a politically embarrassing story, it is easier 
to do so if there is central control over the entire Whitehall media machine”.

Reflections

5.23  This Chapter has focused on aspects of news management during the 13 years of the New 
Labour: insofar as it has become relevant to the Conservative Party and the Coalition, this 
will be analysed in the course of Chapter 4. But precisely because more than one view is 
possible about the advantages and risks of news management techniques, particular care 
must be exercised to ensure that the message – an encapsulation of the facts and policies 
which politicians of whichever party wish to share with the public – is not lost in distractions 
about the packaging.

5.24  Once  again,  the  substantive  issues  which  remain  are  to  do  with  public  perception.  If  the 
public do not have confidence in the politicians to provide a straight message even, where 
necessary, warts and all and the public do not have confidence in the press to provide a fair 
(although not necessarily balanced or impartial) account, everybody in our democracy loses. 
Holding  power  to  account  can  be  partisan,  but  if  the  public  detect  that  it  is  not  fair,  one 
way or the other, the consequent loss of faith will damage both politicians and the press. 
Furthermore, if ‘favoured’ relationships and the transaction of exclusives play a prominent 
role in the presentation of issues or, on the other side, simple error is always portrayed as 
venal,  corrupt  or  wanting  in  integrity,  public  trust  will  be  lost  and  the  currency  of  public 
debate devalued.

the Conservative revival and the Coalition 1

1.	
1.1 

Introduction	and	background
In common with a number of politicians of his generation, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP 
has  spent  most  of  his  adult  life  in  politics.  He  began  his  political  career  working  for  the 
Conservative Party Research Department, before becoming a general political SpAd, first to 
Norman Lamont at the Treasury (1992-1993) and then later to Michael Howard at the Home 
Office (1993-1994).2 During this period he witnessed first-hand the national press’ treatment 
of both Lord Kinnock and Sir John Major. He also forged numerous professional relationships 
with political journalists:3 “…probably in terms of political journalists I got to know, I would 
have said  that was more related to the time when I was a special  adviser, because I was 
dealing with political journalists then and some of them are still around today.” In some cases, 
these became personal friendships.4

1.2 

The working life of Mr Cameron which was beyond politics was spent in the media. Between 
1994 and 2001 he worked for Carlton Communications Plc (Carlton). There, his role involved 
public affairs, Government relations, investor relations and communicating with the financial 
press.5 By his own account this was a period formative of his views on media policy and, in 
particular, about television:6

“I would say my time at Carlton probably taught me more about the television industry, 
about how it was regulated, and maybe we’ll come on to this, a lot of the views I 
formed about media, media policy, media regulation, the BBC – Carlton was quite 
a formative period because I was working for a big part of the British broadcasting 
industry, ITV effectively, and I formed a lot of views and opinions there which I still 
hold today”.

1.3  Mr Cameron retained his interest in politics whilst at Carlton and was elected to Parliament 
as the member for Witney on 7 June 2001.7 This was the period of New Labour’s potent new 
media strategy. His close political ally and near contemporary, George Osborne, put it this 
way: “…we came of political age – myself, David Cameron and others –during that political

period  …”.8  As  a  backbencher,  Mr  Cameron  wrote  a  column  for  the  Guardian  Online.9  His 
perspective has therefore been informed by more than twenty years of political activity and 
wide contact with national newspaper journalists, covering most of the period considered by 
the Inquiry in Module Three.

This subsection of the Report concentrates upon the relationship between Mr Cameron with 
national newspapers during the periods in which he was Leader of the Opposition and then 
Prime Minister. It considers how his media strategy developed in Opposition, including the 
recruitment of Mr Coulson, and the gradual winning of widespread support in the national 
newspapers, most notably The Sun’s dramatic abandonment of Gordon Brown in September 
2009. Was the switch in allegiance the product of a ‘deal’ or did it have other origins? The 
diminution in Mr Cameron’s contacts with the media which followed the general election of 
2010 is explored, as are Mr Cameron’s own contacts with the national newspapers, especially 
their  proprietors  and  senior  executives.  The  emergence  of  the  phone  hacking  scandal  is 
traced, both as it affected Mr Coulson’s position as Director of Communications, and in the 
way that it led to the setting up of this Inquiry. Finally, Mr Cameron’s well known view that 
politicians have become “too close” to the media is assessed.

2.	 Mr	Cameron’s	relations	with	the	press	whilst	Leader	

of	the	Opposition

2.1  Mr Cameron was elected Leader of the Conservative Party on 6 December 2005 and thereby 
became  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition.10  He  explained  the  inherent  disadvantage  which 
Opposition parties face in getting their message across to a media which usually accords more 
priority to covering the Government of the country than it does to reporting the prospective 
policies of the Opposition. Consequently, he saw a particular need for Opposition politicians 
carefully to develop their relations with the media:11

“All politicians are keen to have the opportunity to explain the policies they advocate 
but the media generally considers comments made by Ministers as more newsworthy. 
In  Opposition,  political  parties  operate  on  a  much  smaller  scale  and  sometimes 
struggle to gain media coverage. It is much more difficult to make the public aware 
of the relevance and impact of Opposition policies. For obvious reasons, attention 
and focus is directed on the party or parties in power. Senior politicians in Opposition 
therefore  tend  to  have  to  focus  even  more  on  developing  their  relations  with  the 
media in order to get their message across. As I said in the Commons on 13 July 2011:
“As  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  you  spend  quite  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  persuade 
newspapers and others to support you, because you want to explain your policies, 
your vision and what you are doing for the country.”

2.2 

The practical product of this analysis was a considerable effort on his part to engage with the 
media whilst in Opposition. In terms of scale, the effort was reflected in the sheer number 
of  meetings  and  interviews  with  the  media  which  Mr  Cameron  had  in  Opposition:  1,404 
in  the  four  year,  five  month  period  from  December  2005  to  May  2010:  an  average  of  26

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Imeetings  or  interviews  per  month.12  These  meetings  and  interviews  encompassed  a  very 
wide  range  of  media  contacts  in  both  broadcast  and  print  media,  which  resulted  from  a 
strategy of building “...a relationship with all the relevant media, including political editors, 
editors  and  proprietors”.13  The  volume  and  breadth  of  these  contacts  did  not  prevent  a 
careful and deliberate focus on “...those with the biggest audiences and those best placed 
to get my message across...”14 which was no doubt intended to maximise the return on the 
investment of  time and  effort.  In  practice, for Mr Cameron  that meant the BBC  and  “...in 
terms of newspapers, my focus has been on those who either already held and supported 
Conservative views, or could be persuaded to do so”.15

2.3 

There was some evidence that Mr Cameron’s approach to the media in the period between 
December 2005 and 2007 differed significantly from the period that followed. It was said that 
Mr Cameron sought to establish a relationship with more distance and less deference to the 
media, with reference to Rupert Murdoch in particular. Recalling and interpreting the period, 
Andrew Neil wrote in his evidence that:16

“It is one of the ironies of the current state of relations between press and politicians 
that Mr Cameron did not set out to replicate a Blair/Brown style relationship with 
the  Murdoch  press.  He  told  me  not  long  after  becoming  Tory  leader  in  2005  that 
he would not go cap-in-hand seeking Mr Murdoch’s blessing, denigrating Mr Blair’s 
decision to fly to the other side of the world in 1995 to parade before Mr Murdoch 
and his lieutenants. Rather he would transform the Tory party as he saw fit and, if 
Mr Murdoch liked what he saw, would happily accept his endorsement. But he would 
not seek to ingratiate himself with the media tycoon or recreate the extensive and 
close nexus that existed between the Murdoch Empire and New Labour. This strategy 
lasted until the summer of 2007, by which time Mr Brown was the new Prime Minister 
and enjoying an (albeit brief) honeymoon with the British people so advantageous 
that  there  was  a  widespread  expectation  that  he  would  go  to  the  country  in  the 
autumn and win. Mr Cameron, for his part, found himself friendless: the left-leaning 
press  were  rallying  to  Mr  Brown  while  right-leaning  newspapers  were  becoming 
increasingly  critical  of  the  Tory  leader  and  his  modernising  agenda.  It  was  in  this 
predicament – with a fourth defeat for the Tories staring them in the face – that Mr 
Cameron reached out for Mr Murdoch and his newspapers, with consequences that 
are now being revealed and documented.”

2.4 

George Eustice MP served as David Cameron’s Press Secretary for almost two and half years 
between May 2005 and October 2007. Not inconsistently with parts of Mr Neil’s evidence, he 
has said of his work for Mr Cameron:17

“When  I  was  his  press  secretary,  we  pursued  a  strategy  of  quietly  puncturing  the 
arrogance of both editors and proprietors and raising the status of what I term real 
journalism.”

1166

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.5  Mr Cameron recognised that early on he had not enjoyed much personal support from the 

press:18

“...I’d won the leadership of the Conservative Party without the support of I think any 
newspapers frankly. I had a pretty rocky time with them during the leadership election, 
and I think I’d won the leadership basically through what I’d said at Conservative Party 
Conference and it was television that had helped me to get my message across.”

2.6 

He also acknowledged that initially there were different views about how best the Conservative 
Party could get its message across. For his part, he placed emphasis on television, which he 
believed had been so instrumental in his successful bid for the leadership of the Conservative 
Party:19

“I wanted us to have a good relationship with newspapers. I knew we needed to win 
over more support, but to start with there were certainly some in my office who were 
very keen on trying to do things completely differently and communicate much more 
through the Internet and what have you. I would say I was more cautious about that, 
thinking we wanted to work very hard on television, we should do what we could with 
the newspapers, but I think that’s the way it was...”

2.7 

It  is  worth  pausing  to  note  the  early  emphasis  on  television  which  has  been  retained 
throughout Mr Cameron’s leadership of the Conservative Party. The importance accorded 
to  television  reflects  the  enormous  reach  which  television  has  to  mass  audiences  and  its 
power to communicate political messages notwithstanding the duty of impartiality to which 
broadcasters are subject. It is one of a number of indicators that, whilst the support of national 
newspapers remains very important to modern politicians, that importance has to be seen in 
perspective relative to television and increasingly also to the internet.

2.8  Mr Cameron confirmed that he had wanted more distance and a different approach to the 
media. Significantly though, he recalled them as eliding into one another rather than being 
tried  sequentially.  Given  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  Mr  Eustice’s  observation,  quoted 
above, he said:20

“I think parts of it are right, in that we did want to have this – we didn’t want to go 
down the same route as everything Labour had done. We did want to have a bit more 
distance, but if you look at the record of the sort of meetings I was having and the 
rest of it, I was still, you know, flying off to meet proprietors and trying to win people 
over, so I don’t think it totally squares up that there was one approach that was tried 
and failed and then another approach. There’s slightly more elision between the two, 
my reflection on it.”

2.9  Mr Cameron’s evidence that he had been trying to “win people over” (that is to say, build 
political support) from the time of his appointment is amply borne out by the record of his 
meetings with the media. The record shows a modest increase in the frequency of meetings 
from 2007 onwards, but nothing like a step change.21 His entry in the Register of Members’ 
Interests  dated  27  September  2006  records  a  helicopter  flight  from  London  to  Brecqhou, 
provided by Aidan Barclay. The entry was made the day after he met Sir David and Sir Frederick

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition IBarclay, owners of the Telegraph Media Group for a general discussion, thus showing that Mr 
Cameron was indeed meeting with media proprietors as early as 2006.22

2007: The appointment of Andy Coulson

2.10  Whether  or  not  the  strategies  employed  by  Mr  Cameron  merged  or  were  distinct  and 
sequential,  it  is  clear  that  by  2007  he  was  looking  significantly  to  strengthen  his  media 
operation. He explained that:23

“After my first year or so as Leader of the Party, it became increasingly clear that 
the  Conservative  Party  needed  a  heavyweight  media  operator,  someone  who  had 
operated at the highest levels and who knew how a newsroom was run...”

2.11  The need to recruit a media heavyweight was attributed to the huge pressures upon modern 

political media operations:24

“...I was looking for someone who was a big hitter, and I was looking for someone 
who could really cope with the huge media pressure that you’re under, and tabloid 
editors and leading executives on a tabloid newspaper I think do have – they bring 
something that others wouldn’t, and so there wasn’t a particular wish list, but it was 
trying to get the right person with the right skills.”

2.12  The object was not simply to absorb the pressures but to change and improve the Conservative 

Party’s media operation:25

“I had this very good guy, George Eustice, who was doing a good job. If I was going 
to  bring  someone  in  above  him,  I  wanted  somebody  who  really  would  be  able  to 
materially alter and improve the way we did things, particularly in the face of this 
massive pressure you face.”

2.13  Self evidently, the appointee would need to be sympathetic to Conservative views as well 
as have very considerable experience in the media and particularly of operating successfully 
in  an  intensely  pressured  media  environment.  In  practice  there  was  a  very  small  pool  of 
potential  recruits.  Yet  Mr  Coulson  was  not  the  only  person  considered  for  the  post.  Mr 
Cameron recalled seeing at least four people personally about the position:26

“How many people did I see? Obviously Guto Harri, who’s outed himself or been outed, 
I  did  have  conversations  with  him.  There  was  someone  senior  from  a  broadsheet 
newspaper. There was someone else very senior in the BBC. There was this tabloid 
journalist...”

2.14 

It was Mr Osborne who proposed that Mr Coulson should be approached. At first glance, it 
might be thought surprising that Mr Osborne should have made this particular suggestion. 
As  the  editor  of  the  News  of  the  World  (NoTW),  Mr  Coulson  had  been  responsible  for  a 
damaging front page headline about Mr Osborne: “TOP TORY, COKE AND THE HOOKER”.27

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIWhilst it is true that the story also ran in the Sunday Mirror with a leader far less kind than 
that contributed to by Mr Coulson, a reflection perhaps of the differing political perspectives 
of the two titles, it is certainly impossible to regard the NoTW’s headline as helpful to Mr 
Osborne.28 As the author of the headline “HUG A HOODIE”, Mr Coulson had not helped Mr 
Cameron’s popular profile either.29 The Prime Minister described it as “...the most effective 
and destructive headline about me that anyone’s managed...”30

2.15  The  most  that  could  be said  about  the stance of  the  NoTW on  Mr Cameron’s  bid  for  the 
leadership of the Conservative Party was that it had not been against him. More generally, 
although the paper had engaged William Hague as a columnist between December 2003 and 
2005, when he returned to the Shadow Cabinet, the NoTW under Mr Coulson had supported 
New Labour, backing Mr Blair at the 2005 general election.31 The importance of Mr Coulson 
to the Labour Party is well illustrated by the fact that when Mr Coulson resigned from his 
position as editor of the NoTW in 2007 both Mr Blair and Gordon Brown contacted him to 
commiserate with him on the turn of events.32

2.16  That Mr Coulson had resigned in response to the conviction and imprisonment of one of his 
journalists added yet another reason to question why it was that Mr Coulson’s name came to 
Mr Osborne’s mind.

2.17  Mr Osborne’s explanation for suggesting Mr Coulson to Mr Cameron was that he sensed that 

Mr Coulson was in fact instinctively sympathetic to Conservative views:33

“...I had met Mr Coulson on a handful of previous occasions when he was editor of the 
News of the Word, although we had not met privately before. Under his editorship the 
newspaper had supported the Labour Party in the previous general election. However, 
in my conversations with him, I had sensed that his personal view of political issues 
was more closely aligned with the Conservatives – although I had never asked him as 
editor whether he was someone who had voted Conservative.”

2.18  On this point Mr Osborne’s intuition proved to be correct.34 The circumstances in which Mr 
Coulson had come to resign did not deter Mr Osborne from advocating an approach to Mr 
Coulson because he assumed that the matter had been fully investigated by the police and, 
in any event, he could ask Mr Coulson about it:35

“I was, of course, aware from media reports that Mr Coulson had resigned as editor 
of the News of the World following the convictions of the paper’s Royal correspondent 
Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking. I assumed 
that since the matter had been subject to a police investigation and a criminal trial

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Ithat all the relevant facts had come to light. I also intended to ask Mr Coulson himself 
about the issue – and later did (as set out below).” (emphasis added)

2.19  He  thought  that  as  a  recently  resigned  editor  of  the  NoTW,  Mr  Coulson  would  be  a  very 

strong candidate for the task which was envisaged, explaining:36

“... First of all, he had been the editor of a major national newspaper, so he had an 
enormous amount of professional experience, and what we needed was someone 
who  was  going  to  be  able  to  handle  the  communications  of  a  large  organisation, 
the Conservative Party, and develop a media strategy, but also be able to handle, on 
an hour by hour basis, the problems that were thrown at us ... I thought that Andy 
Coulson had that experience, as someone who had run a large newsroom, was used 
to the pressure of dealing with fast-changing stories.”

2.20  Mr Osborne denied that Mr Coulson’s associations with or contacts with News International 
were relevant factors, whilst emphasising that his experience as the editor of a big newspaper 
and prospects of succeeding in the new role were:37

“Q.  Are you saying that his associations with or contacts with News International 
were not relevant factors at all?
They were not relevant as far as I was concerned, or certainly, as far as I’m aware, 
David Cameron was concerned. The fact that he had edited a big newspaper was the 
relevant fact, and as I say, the other candidates we considered were not people who 
were working for News International. I think if Mr Coulson had, for example, been 
editing the Mail on Sunday, then we would have also hired him. So I think it wasn’t 
relevant that he was a News International ex-employee.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But relevant that he was very experienced in the ways of the 
press?
A.  That was the relevance, sir. I mean, I have seen people suggest that the reason we 
hired him was because of his connections with the Murdochs or Rebekah Brooks or 
his knowledge of the internal workings of News International. I can tell you that was 
not a consideration. What we were interested in hiring is someone who was going to 
do the job going forward ...”

2.21  Mr Cameron had a similar, although not identical, view about the relevance of Mr Coulson’s 
News International background. He was at pains to say that there was no calculation that a 
former News International editor would facilitate winning over the NoTW:38

“Q.  Is it your evidence that his News International background was irrelevant to the 
decision, in other words it was a factor.
A.  No, it wasn’t irrelevant, clearly. As I said, his contacts, his knowledge, his work 
at a newspaper, all of that mattered. But if what lies behind the question [is] were 
you after a News International executive because this was going to make it easier 
to win over the News of the World or whatever, no, that wasn’t the calculation. The 
calculation was: who is going to be good enough, tough enough, to deal with what is 
a very difficult job?”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.22  The right person for the job, to Mr Cameron’s mind, regardless of whether or not he or she 
had a News International background, was someone who was going to be able to “...handle 
tough stories and meet fast deadlines, particularly for tabloid newspapers...” whilst at the 
same  time  engaging  “...more  systematically  with  the  broadcast  media  who  ...have  huge 
influence in terms of political coverage and discussion”.39

2.23  Mr  Osborne  took  forward  his  suggestion  by  arranging  to  meet  Mr  Coulson  for  a  drink 
at  a  central  London  bar,  on  15  March  2007,  two  months  after  he  had  resigned  from  the 
NoTW. Mr Coulson recalled discussing what the Conservative Party should do to organise 
its communications in readiness for a general election. He expressed views which are very 
similar  to  those  held  by  Mr  Cameron,  placing  an  emphasis  on  television  and  the  need  to 
promote good relations over the whole spectrum of the media:40

“I  told  him  that  my  view  of  communications  was  that  it  needed  to  be  first  and 
foremost  professional,  that  we  needed  to  have  good  relationships  with  as  many 
media representatives as possible right across the spectrum, and I also told him in 
that conversation and again later in a conversation with Mr Cameron that my firm 
belief was that television would play a crucial part in any General Election campaign. 
My view was more so than it had done previously.” (emphasis added)

2.24  Mr Coulson felt that it was: “...clear from the off that they were interested in hiring me” and 
did not feel as if he was being interviewed at all.41 He confided in Rebekah Brooks about the 
Conservative Party’s approach.42

2.25  Mr Osborne recalled asking Mr Coulson at the meeting whether he would be interested in 
being considered for the post of the Conservative Party’s Director of Communications. In his 
witness statement he described Mr Coulson saying that he would think about it and calling, 
some days later, to say that he was indeed interested, an answer which Mr Osborne passed 
on to Mr Cameron.43 Mr Coulson’s recollection was slightly different. He believed that Mr 
Cameron had called him later the same night: “...to say that Mr Osborne had told him of our 
conversation and that he would like to meet”.44 In his oral evidence, Mr Osborne’s account 
was consistent with Mr Coulson’s:45

“Q.  And then in paragraph 8.1, after Mr Coulson, a few days later, confirmed that he 
was interested in the job, you had a conversation with Mr Cameron about it; is that 
correct?
A.  Yes. I think I spoke to him pretty soon, actually, David Cameron. My recollection is 
that I probably spoke to him on the way back from the drink I’d had with Mr Coulson

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I2.26  Nothing  turns  upon  which  recollection  is  correct;  both  men  were  trying  to  recall  a  minor 

detail some five years ago.

2.27  Whatever  the  precise  mechanics  were,  the  initial  meeting  was  certainly  followed  up.  A 
meeting with Mr Cameron was arranged at his office in the Norman Shaw Building, probably 
later  in  March  2007.  Mr  Cameron  described  this  meeting  as  having  been  significant:  “...
the key meeting about deciding whether or not to employ him...”.46 Having met Mr Coulson 
and  discussed  his  possible  appointment  with  Mr  Osborne  and  Steve  Hilton,  Mr  Cameron 
decided  in  principle  that  he  wanted  to  appoint  Mr  Coulson  as  the  Conservative  Party’s 
Director of Communications and Planning. He asked the Party Chairman, the Rt Hon Francis 
Maude MP, and his Chief of Staff, Ed Llewellyn, to meet with Mr Coulson to discuss practical 
arrangements.47

2.28  These discussions occurred, and at some stage in the process Mr Coulson also spoke to Mr 
Hilton.48 Final acceptance of the job appears to have occurred in May 2007 after that year’s 
local elections, during the course of a telephone call between Mr Cameron and Mr Coulson.49 
Mr Coulson commenced his employment with the Conservative Party on 9 July 2007.50

2.29  An issue on which all the witnesses were agreed is that during the recruitment process Mr 
Coulson  was  asked  about  phone  hacking.  However,  recollections  differed  as  to  precisely 
who asked what and when they did so. Mr Osborne recalled asking at his very first meeting 
whether there was anything more on phone hacking that he should know about that was not 
already public. He stated that he received a reply in the negative.51 Mr Cameron could not 
recall being told about this but had no reason to doubt Mr Osborne.52 Mr Cameron’s own 
recollection was that not only did he personally raise the matter with Mr Coulson but also 
that it was raised when Mr Coulson met with Mr Maude and Mr Llewellyn:53

“I believe that three such meetings took place: one with both Francis Maude and Ed 
Llewellyn.  These  were  about  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  appointment.  In  the 
meeting they held together, they also asked him specifically about his involvement in 
the well-publicised hacking that had taken place while he was editor of the News of 
the World and which had led to the convictions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. 
He denied any knowledge of the hacking but said that he took responsibility for what 
had  happened  on  his  watch  and  had  therefore  resigned.  This  was  consistent  with 
what he had said at the time of his resignation as Editor” (emphasis added).

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.30  So far as his own investigation of the issue was concerned, in his oral evidence Mr Cameron 
described  raising  the  issue  at  the  face-to-face  meeting  which  he  had  with  Mr  Coulson  in 
March 2007. He said:54

“My recollection is that I raised the issue of phone hacking and sought the assurance 
in  the  face  to  face  meeting  we  had  in  my  office.  That’s  my  recollection.  I  vaguely 
remember the further telephone call, but that’s – I’ve obviously racked my brains to 
try and remember exactly the sequencing, but my recollection is that I knew it was 
very important that I needed to ask him that question, and therefore did so, as it says 
in my evidence”.

and,  in  response  to  the  suggestion  that  the  issue  was  raised  only  during  the  May  2007 
conversation, he said:55

“That’s not my recollection. My recollection is that the assurances I sought were in 
the face-to-face meeting, but it may be there was a further specific question I needed 
to ask in the phone call, I can’t remember.
What I’m absolutely sure about is I remember the conversation with Ed Llewellyn was 
how important it was to see the assurance, and I remember very clearly seeking that 
assurance and getting the assurance...”

2.31  The suggestion  that the issue  had  been raised only  once by Mr Cameron  was put  to him 
because that was how his witness statement appeared to read. Having dealt with the March 
face-to-face meeting without mentioning the issue, and the subsequent meetings with Mr 
Maude  and  Mr  Llewellyn  to  discuss  practical  arrangements,  at  which  they  had  asked  Mr 
Coulson about phone hacking, the witness statement continued:56

“[Francis  Maude  and  Ed  Llewellyn]  reported  these  assurances  orally  to  me,  but 
said that since these were serious allegations I should personally satisfy myself as 
to these assurances by putting these questions directly to Andy Coulson in my own 
conversations with him, and before formally offering him the job.
I  then  had  a  further  conversation  with  Andy  Coulson  in  which  I  also  asked  him 
specifically about his involvement in the hacking case. He repeated what I understood 
he had said to Francis Maude and Ed Llewellyn, that he had no knowledge of the 
hacking but said that he took responsibility for what had happened on his watch and 
had therefore resigned as Editor. I also recall asking him at the same time whether 
there  was  anything  else  which  I  should  be  aware  of  which  might  embarrass  the 
Conservative Party. He said he did not believe that there was.”

2.32  Mr  Coulson  recalled  being  asked  by  Mr  Cameron  during  the  course  of  the  telephone 

conversation in May 2007: “He also asked me about the Clive Goodman case”.57

2.33  The witnesses were trying to recall the precise timing of conversations some five years ago 
now and it is not surprising that in those circumstances that there were some discrepancies. 
I make no criticism of them for that. Whether the issue was raised with Mr Coulson once,

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Itwice, three times, or four times (ie 7 March 2007, at the March 2007 face-to-face meeting 
with Mr Cameron, at the meeting with Messrs Maude and Llewellyn, and during the May 
telephone conversation) I am entirely satisfied that it was raised; given the significance of the 
issue, it was most probably raised on each of the four occasions.

2.34  However many times the hacking issue was raised during the recruitment process, what is 
clear is that the inquiries did not go beyond asking Mr Coulson about the issue and accepting 
his assurances. Mr Osborne described consciously considering whether the circumstances of 
Mr Coulson’s departure ruled him but concluding that it did not. In doing so, he fairly pointed 
to the context at the time which must have been reassuring:58

“I did consider whether the circumstances surrounding Mr Coulson’s departure from 
the News of the World ruled him out as a Director of Communications. But I made what 
I believed was the reasonable assumption at the time that the police had uncovered 
all the relevant evidence. Mr Coulson had also confirmed to me that this was the 
case. It is worth noting that I was not the only person who accepted this. Before the 
appointment was confirmed on 31 May 2007, the Press Complaints Commission said:
There is no evidence to challenge Mr Myler’s assertion that: Goodman had deceived 
his  employer  in  order  to  obtain  cash  to  pay  Mulcaire;  that  he  had  concealed  the 
identity of the source of information on royal stories; and that no one else at the 
News of the World knew that Messrs. Goodman and Mulcaire were tapping phone 
messages for stories.”

2.35  Mr  Cameron  similarly  pointed  to  the  fact  of  the  police  investigation  and  the  subsequent 
prosecution of Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire. He did not shrink from taking responsibility 
for the decision but he understandably reminded the Inquiry of the indisputable importance 
of judging the decision without the benefit of hindsight:59

“The responsibility for employing him on the basis of the assurances that he gave is 
mine. I took the view that because he had given me repeated assurances that he had 
no knowledge of hacking, he deserved a second chance.
If anyone had given me any evidence that Andy Coulson knew about or was in any 
way involved with phone hacking, I would not have employed him.
And as I said in my statement in the Commons on 20 July 2011, with 20:20 hindsight 
and all that has followed, I would not have offered him the job, and I expect that he 
would not have taken it. As I said then, you do not make decisions in hindsight; you 
make them in the present”.

2.36  Before Mr Coulson started work at Conservative Party Headquarters not only had the PCC 
made  a  reassuring  statement  about  the  extent  of  hacking  at  the  NoTW,  so  too  had  the 
Chairman of News International. James Murdoch’s evidence was that:60

“...the company told the Select Committee in March 2007 that it believed that Clive 
Goodman was the only person who knew what was going on, and the Committee 
noted  in  its  report  dated  3  July  2007  “the  assurances  of  the  Chairman  of  News

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIInternational that Mr Goodman was acting wholly without authorisation and that 
Mr Coulson had no knowledge of what was going on”.

2.37  Dealing with the Terms of Reference of what is described as Part 1 of the Inquiry that I am 
conducting, particularly in the light of the current prosecution that Mr Coulson faces, it is 
simply  not  fair  or  appropriate  to  inquire  into  precisely  what  Mr  Coulson  knew  or  did  not 
know about phone interception at the NoTW. On the other hand, however, it is relevant to 
consideration of Mr Cameron’s decision to recruit Mr Coulson to take into account the then 
prevailing positions of both PCC and News International.

2.38  Mr Osborne was unequivocal about his reason for recommending Mr Coulson for appointment: 
“I recommended that Mr Cameron appoint Mr Cameron because I thought that he was the 
best candidate for the job”.61 He described having been “very impressed” by Mr Coulson.62 Mr 
Cameron was similarly focused on Mr Coulson’s skills when appointing him:63

“Well, obviously his knowledge of the industry, his contacts, his work as an editor 
were all important, but the most important thing was: is this person going to be good 
at doing the job of managing the press and communications for the Conservative 
Party? I wasn’t just after some –any old person from News International or from the 
Daily Mail or from wherever. I wanted somebody really good who was going to be 
able to stand up to the pressure that were under and would face in the run-up to an 
election campaign. That was the absolutely key consideration.” (emphasis added)

2.39  Both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne recognised that there was a risk in hiring Mr Coulson, but 

both were content to accept that risk. Mr Osborne put it in these terms:64

“Q.  Why did you run that risk?
A.  Because I thought in the end, the balance was that it was worth hiring someone 
with  real  talent  and  ability  and  weathering  the  adverse  publicity  that  appointing 
someone who had had to resign from the News of the World would bring...”.

2.40  Mr Cameron identified not only the potential controversy arising from the circumstances of 
Mr Coulson’s departure from the NoTW but also the fact that he was a tabloid editor. His 
evidence was as follows:65

“Q.  When you accepted the assurances, did you assess there to be any risk?
A.  What I assessed was that this was clearly a controversial appointment for two 
reasons. One was that bad things had happened at the News of the World while he 
was editor and he had resigned. So he had left his last job after resigning because 
of things that had happened. So that was obviously – as I said in my evidence, I was 
giving him a second chance.

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I“The second reason it was – there was controversy [sic] is this was a tabloid editor 
and there are some people who would say, you know, “Don’t have a tabloid editor”, 
to which my answer would be: it’s a very tough job, dealing with the press for a major 
political party. You need someone who has the skills, who has the knowledge, who 
can really help you through what can be an absolute storm, and so I thought it was 
the right thing to do...”

2.41  The  confidential  nature  of  the  recruitment  process  prevented  the  taking  up  of  formal 
references. Both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne did, however, speak informally to Mrs Brooks 
about Mr Coulson. Mr Osborne recalled a brief conversation which took place in the context 
of the recruitment process:66

“Well,  I  spoke  to  her  after  I’d  seen  Mr  Coulson  and  after  we’d  been  considering  it 
for  a  couple  of  weeks,  and  I  don’t  recollect  the  precise  day  or  anything  like  that, 
but I remember a conversation where I asked her: “Tell me about Andy Coulson. Tell 
me, is he a good person? Is he a good person to work with? What do you think of 
him?” It was never a question about: “Is he going to bring his News International 
connections?” or: “Tell me more about the circumstances of Andy’s resignation.” I 
was just simply asking her opinion of him as professional”.

2.42  Mr Cameron was unsure whether his conversation with Mrs Brooks about Mr Coulson had 
taken place before or after the decision was made, although there would only really have 
been a point to such a conversation before the decision was taken:67

“I wasn’t seeking a reference. I mean, when you’re employing someone like this who’s 
been an editor of a newspaper, you can’t seek sort of formal references. I’m sure I 
would have asked how effective he would be, but this conversation may well have 
taken place after I had made the decision. I can’t recall exactly when the conversation 
took place. But in the end it was my decision. I was satisfied this was the right thing, 
to have a former tabloid editor to help us with our media and communications, and 
it was my decision.”

2.43  Although Mrs Brooks was aware of the recruitment process at the time, Rupert Murdoch 
denied any direct or personal involvement. He described himself as “...just as surprised as 
anybody else...” when he heard the news.68

2.44  An obvious question was the extent to which the decision of the Conservative Party to hire 
Mr Coulson had been influenced by the success in opposition of Alastair Campbell for New 
Labour. Mr Osborne recognised some influence, but both he and Mr Cameron were keen to 
stress that Mr Campbell and Mr Coulson were different men. Mr Cameron’s evidence on this 
point was:69

1176

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Q.  To what extent were you looking at the example of Alastair Campbell as being 
obviously politically in a different place but the sort of man in terms of temperament 
and robustness who would be of assistance to you?
A.  Not necessarily. I don’t think, you know, Alastair Campbell had – he was much 
more political than Andy Coulson, and I think in all sorts of ways there were occasions 
when clearly he’d overstepped the role of what he should have been doing.”

2.45  Mr Osborne put the matter in this way:70

“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Well, is it more that actually he brought skills which you’d 
seen evidenced by New Labour in Mr Campbell?
A.  I think it is undoubtedly the case that Tony Blair had seen that hiring someone 
from the media would bring an added dimension to the communications effort, and 
the Conservative Party had, in opposition, hired a number of people subsequently 
who had been journalists, indeed one person who had been an editor of the paper.
So that was true, but I don’t think that Mr Coulson and Mr Campbell are cut from the 
same cloth, I would suggest. Alastair Campbell was a political editor.
I thought Andy Coulson brought a broader experience, as an editor of a paper, so 
managing a large newsroom, and as I say, I think subsequently the way he did the job 
shows that he was very well qualified to do that job.”

2.46  Having been appointed as Director of Communications and Planning, Mr Coulson’s role was 
to  oversee  all  of  the  party’s  communications  departments  including  press,  broadcast  and 
online. He specifically oversaw all of the communications for David Cameron and his Shadow 
Cabinet and was included in the small group of people with responsibility for the strategic 
planning  and  execution  of  the  General  Election  campaign.  He  attended  Mr  Cameron’s 
morning and afternoon meetings, along with other key staff, and was a part of the general 
planning team. His job was to make sure policy was properly communicated and to advise 
on the likely media impact of policies. The remit was wide enough to encompass speeches, 
press conferences, interviews, and articles given or written by Mr Cameron. He monitored 
broadcast coverage and assumed a central role in crisis management, for example responding 
to the MPs’ expenses scandal.71

2.47  There has been speculation as to whether Mr Coulson had continued to be paid by News 
International  whilst  working  for  the  Conservative  Party.  Disclosure  by  Mr  Coulson  of  a 
compromise  agreement  by  which  his  employment  with  News  Group  Newspapers  Limited 
was  terminated  explained  what  had  happened.  Mr  Coulson  did  not  resign  unilaterally 
without regard to his contractual entitlements. His employment was terminated on terms 
which he agreed with his employer and which were set out in the compromise agreement.72 
Mr Coulson was paid in lieu of his employer’s contractual notice period and compensated 
for the termination of his employment. The sums due to him pursuant to the compromise 
agreement were paid in two tranches, the second of which was in November 2007, after Mr 
Coulson had started work for the Conservative Party. He also received a quantity of restricted

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition INews Corp stock units which vested in him in August 2007, again after the commencement of 
his employment with the Conservative Party.73

2.48 

In other words, Mr Coulson did receive both cash and shares from his former employer whilst 
he  was  working  for  the  Conservative  Party,  but  these  were  payments  made  in  respect  of 
the termination of his employment with News International and agreed at the time of his 
departure from that company. There was no evidence that he was receiving a retainer from 
News International whilst he worked for the Conservative Party.

2.49  Having appointed Mr Coulson there were further developments which must have reassured 
Mr Cameron. In July 2009 Mr Coulson gave the same assurance to the Culture Media and 
Sport Select Committee that he had given to Mr Cameron: “I have never condoned the use of 
‘phone hacking and nor do I have any recollection of incidences where ‘phone hacking took 
place”.  The  Committee  concluded  that  it  had  “seen  no  evidence  that  Andy  Coulson  knew 
that phone-hacking was taking place”. Mr Coulson also denied knowledge of hacking under 
oath in the trial of Tommy Sheridan which was held in December 2009: “I’m saying that I had 
absolutely no knowledge of it. I certainly didn’t instruct anyone to do anything at the time or 
anything else which was untoward”.74 As is discussed later in this section, in 2010 there were 
to be a number of less reassuring developments and, ultimately, Mr Coulson resigned from 
his post in January 2011.75

Strategy and tactics

2.50  Mr Cameron described the approach to planning his media effort in the context of his overall 

strategic planning:76

“Well, the strategy mapped out at the beginning of the year are the things you want 
to achieve, the policies you want to get across, the ideas that you want to champion, 
and  then  after  that,  you  think:  right,  how  do  we  do  that?  What’s  the  mixture  of 
newspapers and television and direct campaigns and the rest we want to do? Then 
following that, you’re looking at: where are we going to have impact?”

2.51  When  it  came  to  assessing  the  relative  importance  of  newspapers,  television  and  direct 
campaigns,  Mr  Osborne  shared  with  both  Mr  Cameron  and  Mr  Coulson  the  view  that 
broadcasting was becoming increasingly important. In particular, Mr Osborne challenged the 
view that newspapers set the agenda and broadcasters follow. He explained how broadcasters 
now quite often set the news agenda themselves and described their power as enormous:77

“Q.  Do you feel, as some have said again, that the news agenda tends to be driven 
by the printed media and the BBC and other broadcasters follow suit, or do you feel 
it’s the other way around or a mixture of the two?
A.  I  saw  Tony  Blair’s  evidence  on  this,  and  I  think  that  might  have  been  the  case 
perhaps when he was Prime Minister. Speaking personally as someone active in front

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIline politics today, I would say the broadcasters are incredibly important. It is not clear 
that they’re always following a newspaper judgment. I would say the significance of 
a story is massively elevated if it is right at the top of one of the big news shows and 
that’s often the judge of whether something is really going to have an impact in the 
political sphere.
Now, quite often they will be picking up indeed stories from newspapers, but quite 
often  they’ll  have  their  own  investigations  and  quite  often  those  –  you  know,  the 
BBC, for example – and I’m a supporter of the BBC, so this is not – I’m not seeking to 
criticise the entire institution, but they will run a special report, a Panorama report, 
then put that top of the Today programme and suddenly we’re all expected to treat 
that as the most important thing happening in Britain that day.
So I wouldn’t say it’s a straightforward process whereby the newspapers run a story 
and the journalists – the broadcast journalists cover it. I think it’s more complicated 
than that, and I think the power of the broadcasters is enormous. It is power exercised 
with responsibility, but nevertheless it’s significant.”

2.52  Mr  Coulson  described  how  he  vigilantly  monitored  broadcasters’  output,  especially  the 
BBC’s, and took issue with it as he thought necessary, whilst keeping open as many lines of 
communication with the organisation as he possibly could:78

“Another  aspect  of  my  job  was  to  monitor  broadcast  coverage,  in  particular  the 
BBC,  given  its  audience  dominance.  My  approach  was  to  keep  as  many  lines  of 
communication as possible open with the BBC, and to argue our case. I never took 
the view that ranting at producers and editors was either proper or productive. But 
I would monitor the BBC’s coverage, including online, and firmly register our view 
when I thought it was appropriate.”

2.53  As for the newspapers, Mr Osborne described a general strategy with achievable objectives:79

“I don’t think it was a particular strategy for the Sun newspaper. It was a strategy for 
the newspapers. We wanted the full throttled support of Conservative-leaning papers 
like the Telegraph and the Mail. We wanted to win over some of those more neutral 
broadsheets like the Times and the FT. We didn’t have much hope of the Mirror and 
the Guardian, and obviously we wanted to win the support of the Sun. But it was a 
general media strategy and it mainly consisted of setting out our argument about 
why the Labour government had forfeited the right to remain in office and why we 
thought a Conservative government would be better for Britain.”

2.54  Mr Cameron, who was essentially agreeing with an observation of Mr Brown’s, identified a 
problem with what he described as the newspapers’ volume knob. It is a feature of modern 
newspaper coverage of politics with which all current politicians have to deal and which one 
supposes must give them an added incentive to make as much effort as possible to cultivate 
good relationships with the press. Mr Cameron put it this way:80

“Q.  Can  I  ask  you  to  address  Mr  Brown’s  point  that  reporting  is  hyperbolic,  it’s 
sensationalised. He said the politicians don’t simply make errors of judgment, their

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Imotives  are  always  put  into  question.  Do  you  associate  yourself  as  a  matter  of 
generality with that point or not?
A.  I think there are occasions when that can happen. As I’ve said, it links back to this 
thing about newspapers being under pressure to find something special and different 
and go for impact, and sometimes that can mean questioning motives. So you do – I 
don’t want to make this sound like sort of politicians complaining about – of course 
we should have a vigorous press and they should give us a good going over and they 
do and that’s fine.
Sometimes it is frustrating when you feel your motives are endlessly being questioned, 
and – but, you know, there’s bound to be a certain amount of that, but I think the way 
I put it is that the volume knob has sometimes just been turned really high in our 
press and I’m not sure sometimes that does anyone any favours.”

2.55  Mr Coulson aimed to meet or talk to most editors, political editors and some columnists on 
a reasonably regular basis (as he also did with broadcast journalists), considering it to be an 
important part of his job. He occasionally met with proprietors or senior executives. These 
meetings were mostly off the record and with an informal agenda. Amongst other things, 
Mr Coulson sought to use the meetings to clear up inaccuracies or misunderstandings which 
had been printed or broadcast or simply to promote the Prime Minister’s message. Together 
with Mr Cameron and other senior Conservative politicians he would also occasionally attend 
meals hosted by newspapers, for example at the party conference when the Telegraph, the 
Daily Mail and The Times all hosted their own dinners. The conference itself was a period of 
intense contact with the media. They would also give speeches at events organised by various 
newspapers.81

2.56  Mr Cameron said that he had sometimes directly asked titles for support: “…But obviously on 

occasion you’d say, “We’d love a bit more support from your paper”.82

2.57  Although  Mr  Cameron  was  in  any  event  spending  a  great  deal  of  time  cultivating  good 
relations with the media and seeking to spread his message through them, it is clear that Mr 
Coulson brought a renewed vigour to this activity with a particular emphasis on ensuring not 
just formal but also informal face-to-face contact with journalists:83

“I attended coffee meetings between David Cameron and other journalists, at various 
times.  In  opposition,  David  and  Samantha  Cameron  would  also  host  occasional 
dinners at his home for media. These included newspaper and broadcast journalists. 
I would usually, although not always, attend. I played a central role in organising this 
diary of activity but David Cameron was not always an entirely willing participant. 
Given the choice, I think he would have preferred to be doing other work or enjoying 
a night home with his family. However, he understood, and reluctantly agreed, that it 
was important to meet with journalists, formally and informally.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.58  Notwithstanding Mr Cameron’s reluctance on occasion to give up his time to cultivate media 
contacts, he did not express to Mr Coulson the view that press and politician were becoming 
too close:84

“Q.  The Prime Minister said in July 2011 words to the effect that “We all got too close 
to News International”. You probably recall that, Mr Coulson, don’t you?
A.  Yes.
Q.  Is that a view he expressed to you before July 2011, in particular before you left, 
which I think was in January 2011?
A.  No, I don’t remember him doing so.”

2.59  Nor did he express that view to Mrs Brooks:85

“Q.  Mr Cameron also said publicly:
We all got too close to News International.” Or words to that effect. Was that a view 
he ever communicated to you personally?
“A.  No.”

2.60  Mr Coulson advanced three reasons to explain why he felt that contact of the nature and 

extent which he was orchestrating had become essential:86

“It  was  important  for  three  reasons.  Firstly,  you  stood  a  better  chance  of  getting 
your  message  across  and  of  stopping  misunderstandings  quickly  if  you  had  good 
relationships. In a perfect world as Prime Minister you would issue a statement, give 
an interview, or stage a press conference and your message would be communicated 
to the public in fair, even-handed reports. Modern politics doesn’t work that way. 
What we did and said required explanation and at times I needed to fight our corner 
for fair coverage.
Secondly, I took the view that it was important that journalists saw David Cameron 
in a relaxed and informal mode, as well as at work. Again, modern politics demands 
this. I felt it was important to show his authentic life away from work, not least as 
the Labour Party was working hard to convince the public that he spent his private 
moments lounging around a mansion, in top hat and tails, sipping champagne and 
nibbling on caviar. This was an important myth to dispel.
Thirdly, journalists want to meet politicians. There is no substitute in journalism for 
face to face contact. It was also important for David Cameron to hear what some of 
the journalists had to say on behalf of their readers and viewers. I believe I was even-
handed in who had access to him”.

2.61  These are revealing insights into what motivated Mr Cameron’s Director of Communications 
to  seek  even  closer  proximity  to  the  media  for  a  principal  who  was  already  highly  active 
and experienced in his dealing with the media. Mr Coulson clearly felt that this extra effort 
was required to achieve the legitimate media goals which are incorporated into the reasons 
quoted above: fair and even handed reporting, the rapid resolution of misunderstandings,

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Ian authentic picture of the politician and receipt of reader and viewer feedback. One might 
easily add to this list.

2.62 

It is self evident that any solution to a problem of over proximity between the press and 
senior politicians must involve a proper distance or, at least, transparency. But if that is to be 
achievable in practice, the politician’s legitimate media objectives, such as those identified 
above,  must  be  attainable  from  that  proper  distance  and  with  appropriate  transparency. 
Otherwise, the temptation to get too close will be irresistible. I shall return to this issue when 
concluding this Part of the Report and making recommendations.

2.63  Mr Coulson drew on his experience in the media to advise about the Conservative Party’s 
communications effort, including matters such as how best to talk to proprietors and editors, 
as Mr Osborne explained:87

“Q.  But was Mr Coulson able to give advice as to how best to obtain the Sun’s support, 
even if, as you say, it was far less important than many commentators have claimed?
A.  Well, I think his advice was how to handle our communications effort. Yes, how to 
talk to proprietors and editors and so on ...”

2.64  Mr  Cameron’s  strategy  of  maintaining  a  very  wide  range  of  media  contacts  met  with  Mr 

Coulson’s entire approval. He said:88

“... I think the party had very good relationships with the Guardian. I think I probably 
wouldn’t include the Daily Mirror, in truth, or the Sunday Mirror. I didn’t put an awful 
lot of effort into either of those papers, although we met and we talked, actually. 
But yes, I – and more importantly David Cameron – took the view that we had to 
talk to as many people as possible. The Tories had a – the party had an electoral 
mountain to climb, it was of historic proportions. So we wanted to touch as many 
readerships as we possibly could and get our message across as far and wide as we 
could.” (emphasis added)

2.65  When  considering  individual  titles  the  Conservative  strategy  was  not  limited  to  those  at 
the top of the organisation but extended to developing contacts and promoting contacts in 
depth. Mr Coulson explained that the rationale for doing so was to maximise the chance of 
favourable coverage:89

“... I was keen actually that we had good relationships throughout – as much as we 
could throughout the paper. Same goes for – if I can keep adding this – for other 
newspapers. It is not – newspapers don’t work that way. You know, you can’t rely 
on a call to an editor to guarantee anything, and nor should you. What you were 
attempting to do was build a series of relationships where when you had something 
positive to say you would give yourself the best possible chance of getting the best 
possible coverage, and so it was actually a range of relationships throughout all the 
newspapers.”

2.66  Returning to one of the concerns which he expressed when explaining why informal face-to-
face contact was important, Mr Coulson identified a growth in the importance of individual

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIpersonality  in  politics  and  stressed  the  need  for  a  great  deal  of  effort  to  ensure  that  an 
“authentic view” of Mr Cameron in particular was being expressed in the media.90

Relations with Telegraph Media Group

2.67  Mr  Cameron  met  Aidan  Barclay,  Chairman  of  TMG,  numerous  times  whilst  in  Opposition, 
sometimes in formal surroundings and sometimes informally. Two of the meetings occurred 
during the contest for the leadership of the Conservative Party, in the form of a meeting at 
Mr Barclay’s office and then a short while later, breakfast at the Ritz (which is owned by the 
Barclay family). There were two more meetings, on 27 April 2006 and 12 June 2007, in the 
period  between  the  leadership  election  and  Mr  Coulson’s  appointment;  both  were  meals 
at the Ritz. Thereafter, there was a dinner on 25 February 2008, a meeting at Mr Barclay’s 
office on 3 November 2009, before Mr Cameron invited Mr Barclay to his home for dinner on 
25 November 2009. The final meeting in opposition was a breakfast at the Ritz on 22 March 
2010, a few weeks before the general election.91

2.68  A text message the day after the pre election meeting evidences the fact that the election 
campaign had been discussed and plans laid for there to be a daily call between the Telegraph 
and the Conservatives during the campaign:92

“David good to see you congratulations to you both on the prospect of an addition to 
the family spoken to tony G and repeated our conversation asked him to be in touch 
to arrange daily call during campaign as discussed. Regards Aidan”

2.69 

In his evidence, Mr Barclay explained the background to the text and, in particular that he 
had suggested that there be a daily call between Mr Cameron and the editor of the Telegraph 
in order most easily to enable Mr Cameron to get his message across:93

“A.  Well,  as  you  probably  realise,  in  any  large  organisation  sometimes  you  have 
difficulty communicating a message across to the right person, particularly if it gets 
passed down the line, and so I suggested to the Prime Minister that if he wanted to get 
the attention of the editor and wanted to get his message across in the most efficient 
manner, he should make a habit of phoning him on a daily basis and I recommended 
that’s what they should do.
Q.  Sorry, is it the Prime Minister calling –
A.  It’s whichever way around it was, but there should be a daily call –
Q.  Between the editor and the Prime Minister?
A.  Yes”(emphasis added).

2.70  Mr Cameron did not think that a daily personal call between him and Mr Gallagher had been 
discussed but he agreed that a call between the Conservative Party and Mr Gallagher had 
been agreed and that its purpose was to facilitate putting across the Conservative message:94

1183

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I“A.  I don’t think so. I think the daily call was between the Conservative Party and 
Tony Gallagher. I don’t know whether it was necessarily going to be me, but I think 
this was me wanting to make sure that the Telegraph knew our policies and our plans 
and all the rest of it. I think that’s what it was about.”

2.71  The advantages for both Mr Cameron and the Telegraph arising from this example of informal 
contact with the proprietor of a friendly title are plain to see. By this time Mr Cameron had 
already secured the clear support of the Telegraph and the discussions on 22 March 2010 
concerned only the mechanics of best communicating Mr Cameron’s message. That the ‘full 
throttled’ support of the Telegraph (as Mr Osborne described the Conservative Party’s goal) 
had been won was made unequivocally clear both during and after Mr Cameron and Murdoch 
MacLennan, the Chief Executive of TMG, had dinner together in February 2010. In his follow 
up letter dated 9 February 2010, Mr MacLennan wrote:95

“As I said when we sat down for dinner, we desperately want there to be a Conservative 
government and you to be our next Prime Minister. We’ll do all we can to bring that 
about and to give you great support in the gruelling months ahead, and as we are 
no fairweathered friend, we’ll be there with you too when you’re in Downing Street.” 
(emphasis added)

2.72  These successes for Mr Cameron were of course not simply the result of dinner with Mr Barclay 
and Mr MacLennan. The Telegraph’s support of the Conservative Party was predictable and 
there had been numerous meetings between senior Conservatives and editors and senior 
executives  from  TMG  over  the  years.  But  they  vividly  illustrate  the  power  of  face  to  face 
meetings  to  maximise  both  the  personal  support  of  a  sympathetic  title  for  an  individual 
political leader and the communication of a political party’s message through it.

Relations with News Corporation and News International

2.73  Mr Cameron was understandably keen to win back the support of News International’s titles 

from New Labour. As he put it:

“No politician who wishes to get his message across to the public could afford not to 
take into account the scope of News International’s coverage when deciding which 
people  to  meet”.96  When  he  assumed  the  leadership  of  the  Conservative  Party  he 
hoped that: “...in time, we would have the support of News International’s papers. 
After all, these papers fundamentally share the same views on society and the free 
market as the Conservative Party”.97

Rupert Murdoch

2.74  Contact with Rupert Murdoch had in fact begun during the leadership contest. Mr Murdoch 
first recalled meeting Mr Cameron socially at a picnic hosted by his daughter Elisabeth.98 He

1184

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIdispelled rumours that his first impression of Mr Cameron was of a ‘lightweight’ politician.99 
Rather, he said that he had been impressed with Mr Cameron as a family man.100 The first 
contact  of  a  strictly  business  nature  was  when  the  two  men  met  at  The  Sun’s  offices  in 
Wapping in October 2005 before the leadership election.101

2.75  Thereafter they met face to face, or were at the same events, on at least ten occasions whilst 
Mr Cameron served as Leader of the Opposition.102 There was some discrepancy between 
the schedules of contact provided by the witnesses.103 There were many potential reasons for 
the discrepancies and no indication that those who had compiled the schedules on behalf of 
their principals had done anything other than their best from old records, diaries etc, which 
were never intended to record precisely what contact had actually occurred.104

2.76  The contact usually took place at meetings over a meal, or at News Corporation functions but 
there was also some social contact. Both men were present, as were Mr Blair and Mr Brown, 
at the wedding of Rebekah Wade to Charlie Brooks on 13 June 2009. Six months later, on 19 
December 2009, Mrs Brooks arranged a dinner attended by the Camerons, the Osbornes, Mr 
Brooks, Rupert, James and Kathryn Murdoch. This event took place not long after The Sun 
had, in September 2009, switched its support from Mr Brown to Mr Cameron, and it is easy 
to envisage it cementing the newly warmed relationship between News International and Mr 
Cameron.

2.77  Describing what passed between them during the course of the working meals which they 

had together, Mr Cameron emphasised Mr Murdoch’s global perspective and interests:105

“…I mean, in most of my lunches or breakfasts with Rupert Murdoch, the conversation 
has always been predominantly about economic issues, security geopolitical issues, 
he  was  very  interested  in  what  was  happening  in  Afghanistan,  very  interested  in 
global markets.
I  think  it’s  –  of  course  all  businesses  have  their  interests  and  the  rest  of  it,  but  in 
my  dealings  with  Rupert  Murdoch,  most  of  the  conversation  has  been  about  big 
international political issues.”

2.78  Mr Murdoch did not recall the detail of the conversations but his recollection generally of his 
conversations with Prime Ministers certainly bore out that these were topics which he spoke 
to senior politicians about and was interested in. His keen interest in geopolitics was very 
probably raised and, in particular, the conduct of the war in Afghanistan and perception of 
public opinion on the circumstances in which British troops were fighting was to play a role in

1185

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition IThe Sun’s transfer of support away from Mr Brown to Mr Cameron.106 His strength of feeling 
on this issue was well illustrated by the following evidence which he gave about his views on 
Mr Brown’s handling of equipment issues:107

“…And Afghanistan I felt very strongly about. First, I thought it was right – this was, I 
think, beyond us going in there. I felt very strongly, particularly when I came here and 
saw the photographs of the great young British soldiers who’d either been wounded 
or killed there, I felt very strongly when the charge was made that they weren’t being 
properly protected, and I was dissatisfied with Mr Cameron’s [sic] answer that they 
were better protected than any other Europeans. Our argument was that they should 
be as well protected as the Americans.
And although we kept the relationship always with Mr Cameron – I’m sorry, Mr Brown, 
you’ll note in the letters between he and I, we always finished with best wishes to our 
families.”

2.79  Mr Murdoch’s interest, and that of The Sun, in British soldiers included News International 
Supply Company Ltd funding the Leader of the Opposition’s Combat Stress Summit at the 
House of Commons, as declared in Mr Cameron’s entry for 15 July 2009 in the Register of 
Members’ Interests.108 Mr Brown was the subject of strongly worded criticism by The Sun on 
matters relating to Afghanistan.

2.80  Mr Cameron said that he had not had a conversation either with Mr Murdoch or any other 
proprietor akin to that which Sir John Major had had with Mr Murdoch in which the latter 
had made clear that he could not support the Conservative Party unless policy on Europe was 
modified.109

2.81  On questions of media policy, Mr Murdoch denied discussing broadcasting regulation with 
Mr Cameron, BBC license fees, or Ofcom’s role. He said, surprisingly, that the BBC and Ofcom 
had not come up in conversation even to the extent of his view being sought:110

“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: – I’d like to ask you to separate out in your mind the question 
whether you might be discussing some topic or issue for commercial advantage – 
you’ve told Mr Jay that you never did – from the separate question: whether in fact 
these were topics that were worthy of discussion and on which you had a view. So, 
for example, you’ve mentioned that you talked about Afghanistan, and it would be 
perfectly reasonable for you to have a view on that. Lots of people will. And your 
view may be informed by your worldwide contacts through the businesses that you 
operate.  That’s  merely  your  view.  But,  therefore,  your  view  on,  for  example,  the 
regulation of television would itself be of value and may be of interest to those who 
are formulating policy, not because it necessarily would affect News Corp, but because 
this is a business to which you have devoted your life, therefore it’s not surprising you 
will have strong views and I’m just slightly surprised –
A.  I understand.

1186

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansILORD JUSTICE LEVESON: – if nobody did ask your view.
A.  I understand, sir. I just wish to say that I’d long since become disillusioned and it 
was a waste of time to talk to politicians about the BBC, and that was about all there 
was to it. And Ofcom, no, I did not speak to him about that. It would have been asking 
for something, probably, and I didn’t do that.”

2.82  Mr Murdoch was at pains to point out that if his priority had been to secure the most benign 
regulatory environment for his business interests then he would always have supported the 
Conservative Party which, of course, has not always happened. He said:111

“No,  Mr  Jay,  you  keep  inferring  that  endorsements  were  motivated  by  business 
motives, and if that had been the case, we would have endorsed the Tory Party in 
every election. It was always more pro business. I could have been like the Telegraph. 
I  could  even  have  texted  him  every  day.  But  I  didn’t.  I  was  interested  in  issues.” 
(emphasis added)

And later:112

“If I’d been interested in commercial interests, I would have supported the Tory Party 
in every election, because they were always more pro business –“(emphasis added)

2.83  He did not pretend though that his interest in issues was entirely divorced from his business 
interests:  “…it  was  also  in  my  interests  to  reflect  the  views  or  to  talk  to  our  readers,  and 
maybe attract more readers.”113

2.84  For  his  part,  Mr  Cameron  was  emphatic  that  there  had  been  no  ‘deals’  between  the 
Conservative Party and News International. He rejected the suggestion that there had been 
either express or implied deals with the media with this answer:114

“A.  I don’t accept that. First of all, on this idea of overt deals, this idea that somehow 
the Conservative Party and News International got together and said, “You give us 
your support and we’ll wave through this merger”, that by the way we didn’t even 
know about at that stage, I think the idea of overt deals is nonsense, and you’ve heard 
that from lots of people in front of this Inquiry. I also don’t believe in this theory that 
there was a nod and a wink and some sort of covert agreement. Of course, I wanted 
to win over newspapers and other journalists, editors, proprietors, broadcasters.
I worked very hard at that because I wanted to communicate what the Conservative 
Party and my leadership could bring to the country. I made those arguments. But I 
didn’t do it on the basis of saying, either overtly or covertly, “Your support will mean I’ll 
give you a better time on this policy or that policy”, and there are plenty of examples 
of policies that I believe in that the people who were backing me didn’t believe in.”

2.85  One meeting which was to prove important from the point of view of public perception, if not 
of substance, was that which occurred on board a yacht, probably Elisabeth Murdoch’s, off 
the Greek island of Santorini, on 16 August 2008.115 The meeting, which resulted a brief face-

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Ito-face encounter in a social context, involved some convoluted travel arrangements which 
were made possible by the provision of a private jet owned by Matthew Freud, Elisabeth 
Murdoch’s husband and a longstanding friend of Mr Cameron.116 Mr Cameron, who declared 
the flight in the Registry of Members’ interests, explained the lengths to which he had been 
prepared to go to meet Mr Murdoch:117

“My wife and two of my children flew on Mr Freud’s jet from Farnborough to Istanbul, 
where I met them on the way back from a visit to Georgia (which had recently been 
invaded by Russia). We then flew on the jet to Santorini where I met Mr Freud on his 
yacht before meeting Rupert Murdoch. After that we returned on the jet to Dalaman 
for a family holiday. My family and I did not fly back to London on the jet and I paid 
for my air fare as well as that of my family.”

2.86  The excursion to Santorini was proposed to Mr Cameron by Mr Freud. For Mr Cameron it was 
an opportunity to try and win support from Mr Murdoch, by engaging directly at a personal 
level:118

“Well, from my point of view, it was just a better opportunity to try to get to know 
Rupert  Murdoch  better.  Obviously  I  was  trying  to  win  over  his  newspapers  and 
put across my opinions, so for me it was just an opportunity to try and build that 
relationship.”
“It was quite a long way to go and all of that, but it seemed a good opportunity”.

2.87  For Mr Murdoch, the meeting was less memorable. He did not recall it and had had to check 
with his wife and daughter to remind himself.119 He regarded the lengths to which Mr Cameron 
had gone to meet him as not unusual and one got the feeling that Mr Murdoch was well used 
to political leaders seeking him out: a telling indicator of the power and importance of one of 
the biggest media proprietors:120

“A.  Well, I think I’ve explained that politicians go out of their way to impress people 
in the press, and I don’t remember discussing any heavy political things with him at 
all. There may have been some issues discussed passingly. It was not a long meeting. 
As I say, I don’t really remember the meeting. I think that’s part of the democratic 
process. They – all politicians of all sides like to have their views known by the editors 
of newspapers or publishers, hoping that they will be put across, hoping that they will 
be – that they will succeed in impressing people. That’s the game.”

The proprietor later added:121

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Mr Cameron might, of course, think stopping in Santorini would impress me. I don’t 
know. But I certainly didn’t – ... I didn’t, I don’t have any fealty to the Tory Party or to 
the Labour Party ...”

2.88  Mrs Brooks’ recollection was that Mr Cameron had spent “… an afternoon and an evening …” 
with them.122 She had been a party to some but by no means all of the conversation between 
Mr Cameron and Mr Murdoch and concluded that:123

“Well, it seemed to – it was a very cordial meeting and it went well. Like I say, it lasted 
for either an afternoon or an evening, so it wasn’t particularly long”.

James Murdoch

2.89  Mr Cameron saw more of James Murdoch than Rupert Murdoch whilst in Opposition. There 
were at least 15 meetings during this period.124 The type of contact was similar, typically taking 
place over meals or at events.125 Mr Cameron’s purpose in meeting James Murdoch was to 
get across his political message in the hope of winning the support of News International:126

“…  most  of  these  meetings  were  really  about  me  trying  to  promote  Conservative 
policy,  the  Conservative  approach  and  the  rest  of  it,  but  sometimes,  because  I’m 
interested in media issues and have longstanding views on them, sometimes I’m sure 
we would have discussed them.”

2.90  There were wide ranging discussions including defence and economy.127 As James Murdoch 
put it: “… discussions were on a broad range of subjects, from foreign policy to other things”.128

2.91  Of particular interest to the Inquiry, they also discussed both the role of Ofcom and the BBC, 
subjects on which each held different views. Speaking about the BBC and Ofcom, Mr Cameron 
put it this way:129

“…  I’m  sure  that  over  the  years  I’ve  discussed  some  of  those  issues  with  James 
Murdoch. He has very strong views on them, I have very strong views, they’re not 
really the same views, and I’m sure we would have had discussions about it. Perhaps 
particularly – well, I think probably on both. I don’t recall the specifics, but I’m sure 
we must have discussed our views.”

2.92  These differences of view did not prevent News International ultimately coming to the view 
that The Sun should stop supporting Mr Brown and instead support Mr Cameron. When that

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Itime came, it was James Murdoch who first signalled the change of course to Mr Cameron. 
Both the differences of view and the circumstances of The Sun’s political change of mind are 
discussed further below.130

Rebekah Brooks

2.93 

Influential, and supremely connected, Rebekah Brooks (née Wade) was editor of The Sun when 
Mr Cameron became Leader of the Opposition. She remained in that role until September 
2009 when she was promoted to become Chief Executive of News International.131

2.94  The Inquiry took evidence from both Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks about their contacts. Both 
provided lists of their contacts, Mr Cameron a list of meetings with media figures as Leader 
of the Opposition and Mrs Brooks a list of meetings with leaders of political parties.132 As has 
already been adverted to above, there were many straightforward reasons why Mr Cameron’s 
list could not be 100% accurate or comprehensive.133 Similar considerations applied to Mrs 
Brooks’  list  and  she  accepted  that  hers  was  not  comprehensive.134  It  is  plain  enough  that 
neither list is comprehensive insofar as it relates to contact between the two because each 
contains a number of entries relating to such contact not found in the other. Nevertheless, 
they were useful starting points for piecing together enough of their contact to form a reliable 
impression of what had passed between them in this period. Supplemented by the oral and 
documentary evidence, the Inquiry was able to build a picture, amply sufficient for its high 
level Terms of Reference. The account which follows is drawn from the totality of the evidence.

2.95  After the leadership contest, contact started on 18 January 2006, when Ms Wade (as she 
then was) was one of a party of senior News International figures who accompanied Rupert 
Murdoch when he lunched with Mr Cameron.135 During the leadership race itself, Mrs Brooks 
did not recall supporting any particular candidate. She said:136

“Q.  Mrs Brooks, we’re onto Mr Cameron now, According to his biography, in 2005, 
you actually supported Mr Liam Fox for the Conservative leadership. Is that correct 
or not?
A.  I don’t think that is correct. I can’t – I don’t think the Sun came out for a particular 
candidate in the leadership. We probably didn’t support Ken Clarke because of Europe, 
but I don’t remember actually having a particular line in the paper for the leadership”.

2.96  Ms Wade next dined with Mr Cameron, in the company of Trevor Kavanagh on 28 March 
2006. Further dinners followed on 30 September and 1 October 2006, both in the company 
of a number of journalists from other media companies.137 Ms Wade’s record of contact also 
included a meeting at a hotel on 15 June 2006.138

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.97  Meetings with Mr Cameron in 2007 started with a lunch on 16 January 2007, attended by 
colleagues from both The Sun and the NoTW and included a dinner on 1 October 2007, at which 
Les Hinton and journalists from The Sun were present, as well as drinks on 30 December 2007. 
As has already been discussed above, it was during the course of this year that Mr Coulson 
was recruited by Mr Cameron who spoke to Mrs Brooks about him.139 Mrs Brooks’ schedule 
of meetings with party leaders records a dinner with Mr Cameron on 24 March 2007.

2.98  As for telephone contact during this period, including mobile phone contact, Mr Cameron 

described telephoning less than once a week. Less often, he thought, than Mr Brown:140

“In opposition, perhaps particularly sort of 2006, 2007, not a huge amount. I mean, I 
always felt when I did ring her, ... it felt like I was telephoning a lot less than Gordon 
Brown, which I thought was interesting, that he was the Prime Minister and I was the 
leader of the opposition. My sense was I was in contact a lot less than he was. But I 
can’t put numbers on it.

But certainly, you know, in 2006, 2007, not necessarily every week, I don’t think”.

2.99 

In 2008, Mr Cameron and Ms Wade lunched on 23 April 2008. They were both at a social 
event  on  5  July  2008  and  an  event  on  10  July  2008.  On  16  August  2008  they  were  both 
at a dinner with Matthew Freud and Elisabeth Murdoch (this being the occasion on which 
Mr Cameron flew to Santorini and also met Rupert Murdoch). Relations between Mr Cameron 
and Ms Wade were already warm by this stage. She accepted that by then she was “quite 
friendly” with Mr Cameron.141 Ms Wade and colleagues from The Sun dined with Mr Cameron 
on 29 September 2008.

2.100  The Rt Hon Dominic Grieve MP was the Shadow Home Secretary between June 2008 and 
January  2009.142  There  was  animated  discussion  about  the  Human  Rights  Act  at  a  dinner 
at which Ms Wade, Mr Grieve and other shadow cabinet members, but not Mr Cameron, 
were present. The discussion turned upon the Conservative Party’s interest in the possibility 
of repealing the Human Rights Act and replacing it with a British Bill of Rights. According 
to Mrs Brooks, Mr Grieve was “just making the legal point that it was very difficult to do”. 
Mrs  Brooks  denied  rumours  that  she  later  sought  to  persuade  Mr  Cameron  to  remove 
Mr Grieve from his portfolio as Shadow Home Secretary, asserting that it was his colleagues 
who were in disagreement with him at the time:143

“No, I did not tell Mr Cameron to move him. What – the conversation – as I say, it 
was a very heated conversation, borne out by – his colleagues were trying to almost 
silence him at the table because he was, in effect, saying one of the promises the 
Conservatives had made to the electorate was they were going to repeal – and it was 
almost the opposite way around, that they were concerned that his view was not to 
be taken seriously, and as it turned out, he was entirely correct”.

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I2.101  Mrs Brooks also denied expressing a view in any way to Mr Cameron about Mr Grieve.144

2.102  Mrs Brooks’ list of meetings with the leaders of political parties refers to a breakfast meeting 
with Mr Cameron at the start of the year, on 22 January 2008 and to a New Year’s Eve Party 
on 31 December 2008. Neither of these entries is in Mr Cameron’s list. The New Year’s Eve 
Party was held at the Brooks’ farm and was in fact hosted by Mr Brooks’ sister. By 2008, Mr 
Cameron counted Ms Wade as a good friend, notwithstanding her paper’s support, and her 
personal  support,  for Mr Brown.145 The  growing  friendship  had  been helped  along  by the 
fact that Mr Cameron had known Charlie Brooks, whom Mrs Brooks was to marry in 2009, 
for  over  30  years.146  It  did  not  prevent  her  newspaper  giving  its  continued  support  to  Mr 
Brown’s Government and remaining critical of the Conservatives. For example, on 14 October 
2008, The Sun criticised Conservative opposition to extending the detention time for terrorist 
suspects to 42 days.147

2.103  There was a dinner on 29 January 2009 at which a number of newspaper editors and Robert 
Peston were present. Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks were both at Mr Brooks’ book launch on 
1 April 2009. Mr Cameron was then one of a number of high profile politicians who attended 
the wedding of Ms Wade to Mr Brooks on 13 June 2009. As has been explained he was a 
friend of both the bride and groom. The wedding further cemented Mr Cameron’s friendship 
with Mrs Brooks. In his words: “… our relationship got stronger when she married Charlie 
Brooks, who I’ve known for some time and who’s a neighbour”.148

2.104  It  was  during  this  month  that  Mrs  Brooks  recalled  initial  internal  discussions  with  Rupert 
and  James  Murdoch  about  transferring  The  Sun’s  political  support.149  Although  it  was  not 
Mrs Brooks who informed Mr Cameron of The Sun’s decision to abandon its support for Mr 
Brown, Mr Cameron had felt that she was onside months rather than weeks before it actually 
took place.150 On 21 September 2009, a few days before The Sun announced its change of 
allegiance, James Murdoch, Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron had dinner together. The three also 
shared breakfast on 2 November 2009 and on 19 December 2009 Mr Cameron dined with 
Mrs Brooks and Rupert Murdoch at the Brooks’.

2.105  Mrs  Brooks’  list  of  meetings  with  party  leaders  for  2009  includes  a  lunch  at  the  home  of 
James and Kathryn Murdoch on 3 May 2009, a meeting on 1 September 2009 and dinner at 
the Camerons’ home on 24 October 2009. None of these meetings appeared in Mr Cameron’s 
record. As best she could recall, Mrs Brooks thought that the European constitution debate 
and Afghanistan were discussed on 3 May 2009.151

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.106  The increasing social contact that Mr Cameron was having with Mrs Brooks brought about a 
commensurate increase in telephone contact. When asked about such contact in the years 
2008 and 2009, Mr Cameron put it this way:152

“I  think  as  we  got  closer  to  the  election  and  the  decision  of  the  Sun  and  also  the 
wedding and she’s moved in to Charlie Brooks’ house, which is very near where I live 
in – where we live in the constituency, then the level of contact went up, and we saw 
each other socially more.”

 And then:153

“It’s very difficult because I don’t have a record and I don’t want to give you an answer 
that  isn’t  right,  so,  you  know,  sometimes  I  expect  we  would  have  been  talking  to 
each other quite a bit, particularly around the time perhaps of the wedding or when 
we were both in Oxfordshire, we would have had more frequent contact” (emphasis 
added).

2.107  A check by Mr Cameron with Mrs Samantha Cameron’s diary was able to provide more detail, 
enabling Mr Cameron subsequently to add: “…[Mrs Cameron] points out that we were only in 
the constituency 23 weekends in 2008, 23 weekends in 2009 and I think 15 in 2010. And she 
reckons we probably didn’t see them more than on average once every six weeks, so that is a 
better answer than what I was able to give you earlier.”154

2.108  Mr  Cameron  and  Mrs  Brooks  also  used  SMS  text  messages  to  keep  in  touch.  Mrs  Brooks 
estimated that she exchanged texts on average once per week with Mr Cameron, more during 
the subsequent general election campaign:155

“Probably  more  –  between  January  2010,  maybe  –  during  the  election  campaign, 
maybe slightly more, but on average, once a week”.

2.109  Text contact between Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks reflected the close and friendly relationship 
which both explained had developed. This was not in issue because Mr Cameron agreed in 
general  with  the  gist  of  her  evidence  about  the  quantity  and  tone  of  text  messages.156  If 
illustration is needed, when asked how the messages were signed off, Mrs Brooks said:157

“A, … He would sign them off “DC” in the main”
Q.  Anything else?
A.  Occasionally he would sign them off “LOL”, “Lots of love”, actually until I told him it 
meant “laugh out loud”, then he didn’t sign them like that any more. But in the main, 
DC, I would have thought.”

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I2.110  It is important that I repeat what I made clear during the hearing. Like everyone else, politicians 
are entitled to be friendly with whomsoever they wish and there must remain some space for 
a private life in even the most public of figures. For the purposes of the Inquiry, concerned 
with the relationship between politicians and the press, what matters is the extent to which 
the influence of the press can be manifest not only in public, through the megaphone of 
newspapers, or formally through transparent access, but also informally in ways which might 
cause a perception of undue influence. It is unnecessary, intrusive and unhelpful to descend 
into too much detail of personal contact; only its extent needs to be clear: this also I shall 
return to in the context of conclusions and recommendations.

2.111  That point naturally leads to the quantity of text messages passing between Mr Cameron and 
Mrs Brooks which were disclosed by News International and thus identifies the approach of 
the Inquiry to them. Mr Jay explained why only one of these was put into evidence:158

“I  should  make  it  clear  before  I  read  it  out  that  News  International  have  recently 
disclosed a number of other text messages between Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron, 
pursuant to a Section 21 request. A section 21 request is in fact an order under statute 
requiring people to disclose material. Those relate to the period October 2009, May 
2011 and June 2011. In the Inquiry’s judgment, all the other text messages I have 
referred to are irrelevant to its terms of reference. That’s why we’re only going to look 
at one. And News International through their solicitors Linklaters have also explained 
why text messages in other monthly periods are not available, and their letter will be 
put on our website.
So  the  one  we’re  looking  at  is  7  October  2009,  which  I  think  is  during  the  party 
conference.”

2.112  The text in question (which has been the subject of considerable media attention) was sent 
by Mrs Brooks to Mr Cameron on 7 October 2009 at 16:45hrs, just days after The Sun had 
abandoned  support  for  Mr  Brown.  After  the  first  line  which  was  redacted  on  grounds  of 
relevance, the text read:159

“But seriously [which suggests that the first line contains or might contain something 
of  a  jocular  nature]  I  do  understand  the  issue  with  the  Times.  Let’s  discuss  over 
country supper soon. On the party it was because I had asked a number of NI [that’s 
obviously  News  International]  people  to  Manchester  post  endorsement  and  they 
were disappointed not to see you. But as always Sam was wonderful – (and I thought 
it was OE’s that were charm personified!) I am so rooting for you tomorrow not just 
as a proud friend but because professionally we’re definitely in this together! Speech 
of your life? Yes he Cam!” (emphasis added)

2.113  The reference in the message to “tomorrow” was to Mr Cameron’s speech to the Conservative 
Party Conference. The background to the message was that Mr Cameron had apologised for 
not attending the Times’ party at the conference.160 The striking phrase “we’re definitely in it 
together” was, in Mr Cameron’s words, a reference to the fact that, having parted company 
with Labour, The Sun wanted to: “…make sure it was helping the Conservative Party put its

and all the rest of it …” and “…we were going to be pushing the same political agenda.”161 
The  text  illustrates  how  complete  the  sudden  transfer  of  support  was  and  how  close  the 
communication between News International and Mr Cameron was.

2.114  Mr Cameron confirmed that a country supper was the sort of interaction he often had with 
Mrs Brooks and demonstrates how the discussion of professional matters in a very informal 
social environment was occurring.162

2.115  The only pre-election meeting in 2010 between Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron recorded in 
Mr Cameron’s schedule of contact with the media in opposition was on 29 January 2010, at 
an event also attended by the editors of the Times and the Sunday Times.163 This appears to 
correspond with Mrs Brooks’ record which refers to a single meeting at News Corporation’s 
Davos conference in that month.164 More meetings in fact took place. Mrs Brooks recalled 
meeting the Prime Minister “three or four times” between January 2010 and the election.165

2.116  During the general election campaign of 2010 Mrs Brooks put the frequency at twice a week. 

As to their content, she said:166

“Some, if not the majority, were to do with organisation, so meeting up or arranging 
to speak. Some were about a social occasion, and occasionally some would be my 
own personal comment on perhaps the TV debates, something like that”.

2.117  Mrs Brooks did not text either Mr Brown or Mr Clegg during the campaign.167

2.118  Tracing the development of the communications between Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks during 
opposition reveals clear trends. The volume of contact increased over time, particularly as a 
result of the increasing social contact. The nature of the contact changed. At the start it can 
only really have involved Mr Cameron trying to get his political message across to the editor of 
a newspaper then supporting the opposition. By the end, it was less a matter of Mr Cameron 
getting his message over to the new editor of The Sun and more a question of News International 
being “in it together” with Mr Cameron, and seeking to get his message across for him.

2.119  It was not only Mrs Brooks who played a part in the developing contact between Mr Cameron 
and News International. Matthew and Elisabeth Freud (née Murdoch) also moved in similar 
circles. As has been described, Mr Freud provided his private jet to enable Mr Cameron to 
meet Rupert Murdoch in Santorini.168 He and his wife had dinner with Mr Cameron and Ms 
Wade during the course of Mr Cameron’s brief visit on that occasion. Rupert Murdoch first 
met Mr Cameron at a picnic hosted by his daughter Elisabeth.169 Mr Cameron’s list of contacts 
with media figures as Leader of the Opposition records six occasions on which Mr Cameron 
met either one or both of the Freuds. Three of these occasions are listed as “social” contact 
and the remainder as “dinner”.

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition IThe Sun’s transfer of support from Labour to the Conservatives

2.120  As  relations  warmed  between  Mr  Cameron  and  Mrs  Brooks,  so  they  appear  to  have 
cooled between Mr Brown and Mrs Brooks, at least professionally. Criticism of Mr Brown’s 
Government increased and the subject of Afghanistan, in particular, became an issue on which 
The Sun was highly critical of Mr Brown. The title ran a campaign critical of the equipment 
and resources being allocated to British forces in Afghanistan, reflecting Rupert Murdoch’s 
strong views on the issue. One of the last headlines which Mrs Brooks published as the editor 
of The Sun, on 28 August 2009, read “Don’t you know there’s a bloody war on?”.170

2.121  Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, Mrs Brooks, Dominic Mohan, Trevor Kavanagh and Tom 
Newton Dunn were all involved in the discussions which led to the decision to abandon Mr 
Brown.171 The discussions appear to have begun around June 2009.172

2.122  By  10  September  2009  the  plan  to  switch  support  was  sufficiently  concrete  for  James 
Murdoch to meet Mr Cameron at The George and tell him that it was going to happen. Mr 
Cameron described a short meeting of 30-40 minutes’ duration. At that stage Mr Cameron 
was not given the precise date on which the switch would be announced but he was given an 
indication that it would be during the conference season. Mr Cameron recalled:173

“… It was a drink and a catch-up, but it was – he wanted to tell me that the Sun was 
going to support the Conservatives and he told me, I think, from my memory, that 
it was going to happen around the time of the Labour conference, and I remember 
obviously  being  pleased  that  the  Conservative  Party  was  going  to  get  the  Sun’s 
support,  and  I  think  we  had  a  conversation  about  other  policy  issues  at  the  time. 
That’s my memory of it”.

2.123  Mr Cameron could remember discussion of economic policy and defence but not mention of 
Conservative policy on either the BBC or Ofcom, about which James Murdoch had pronounced 
views.  Both  bodies  had  received  trenchant  criticism  as  recently  as  28  August  2009  in  the 
controversial MacTaggart lecture that James Murdoch had delivered. Asked directly whether 
either had been mentioned Mr Cameron said:174

“A.  I  don’t  recall  that,  and  I  think  it  unlikely.  I  think  that  this  was  –  he  was  very 
keen to tell me directly that the Sun was going to support the Conservatives, that 
he felt on the big economic judgment about what Britain needed we had the right 
argument, the government had the wrong argument, and my memory is that’s what 
the conversation was about.
LORD  JUSTICE  LEVESON:  Yes,  you  said  you  had  a  conversation  about  other  policy 
issues?

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIA.  Yes,  he  has  lots  of  enthusiasms  that  aren’t  about  the  media.  He’s  particularly 
enthusiastic about defence. He takes the view we should have at least six aircraft 
carriers, I think at the last count, rather than two, so he has lots of enthusiasms and 
I’m sure we discussed some of those, but the key – my memory is, and it’s difficult 
to recall all of these events, I definitely remember him saying the Sun was going to 
support the Conservative Party. I wouldn’t forget that. I think he gave me a hint of the 
timing, and my memory is it was mostly about the big economic picture, because that 
was the key issue of the day”.

2.124  James  Murdoch  emphatically  denied  any  mention  of  regulatory  issues  on  10  September 

2009: “At that meeting I certainly didn’t”.175

2.125  The change, when it came, was calculated to do maximum political damage to Mr Brown.176 
It was announced through The Sun headline: “Labour’s Lost It”, published on 30 September 
2009, the day after Mr Brown’s speech to the Labour Party Conference.177 The timing and 
choice of headline bore a significance that went beyond simply communicating the transfer 
of The Sun’s political support, important though that was. The emphasis was placed heavily 
on the move away from Mr Brown personally rather than the shift towards Mr Cameron.

2.126  Mr Coulson would have preferred an endorsement of Mr Cameron timed to coincide with 
the Conservative Party Conference. He stated: “I felt it was more a rejection of Labour than a 
positive endorsement of us. If I’d had half the influence on The Sun that some claim, the front 
page would have looked very different”;178 and he said: “… I didn’t get involved in the Sun’s 
decision on the timing and frankly, had I done, I would have wanted it to come as a positive 
endorsement of the Conservatives in our conference.”179 Nevertheless, he regarded securing 
the title’s support as “… a serious positive for us …”.180

2.127  A number of explanations were given by witnesses for the change in support. Rupert Murdoch 
confirmed that he had been very much involved in the decision. He felt that Labour “was 
making lots of mistakes”181 and also compared the decision to that which he had made in 
1997 only in reverse, stating: “I supported a shift to Labour by NI’s titles when I thought the 
Conservative Party had run out of ideas, and I supported a shift to the Conservative Party after 
13 years of Labour rule for the same reason”.182

2.128  James Murdoch described the discussions which led to the decision in terms of discussion of 

Labour policies:183

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I“The  Sun  is  a  campaigning  paper  involved  in  many  policy  issues,  and  there  were 
discussions about some of these issues. The paper had started moving away from 
the  Labour  party  over  lack  of  funding,  supplies  and  support  for  British  troops  in 
Afghanistan after the government had committed to the conflict there. The consensus 
was reached after discussing a range of policies and effectiveness at implementing 
them and resulted in the decision to support a change of Government.”

2.129  He confirmed that polling data was available, and accepted that they were trying to read 
the mood of the country. There was also consideration of the individuals involved and the 
readership.184 The decision had a number of components.

2.130  Mrs Brooks described having an instrumental role in the change of support. Asked whether 
she had played a major role, she said: “I was certainly instrumental in it. I mean, ultimately, 
Rupert Murdoch’s the boss, but I was instrumental in it, as was Trevor Kavanagh, Tom Newton 
Dunn and the editor, Dominic Mohan”.185 She said that the decision was taken because it was 
“the right thing to do for the paper and for our readership.”186

2.131  All those from whom the Inquiry received evidence denied that there had been any conditions 
or exchanges, whether express or implied, upon which The Sun’s support was contingent.187 
The allegation that the transfer of The Sun’s support to the Conservatives was the product of 
a ‘deal’ between News International and the Conservative Party was made publicly by Lord 
Mandelson when he was interviewed on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, a matter of 
weeks after The Sun’s about turn. He told the Inquiry that the basis for his view was what he 
perceived to be a coincidence between the views expressed in James Murdoch’s MacTaggart 
lecture and Conservative media policy:188

“Q.  I’m going to come to that. Your feeling was that some sort of deal had been done 
between the Conservative Party and News International. You said as much on Radio 
4, the Today programme, on 11 November 2009, didn’t you?
A.  I did say that, and I know that, you know, some people have said that I was just, 
you know, throwing around these claims for specious reasons or without evidence. 
In fact, I made these comments both on the Today programme and in the House of 
Lords, when it was clear to me that there was more than a coincidence, if I can put it 
that way, between the Tory’s media policies and the views that were being expressed, 
for example, by James Murdoch in his MacTaggart lecture.
In July 2009, Mr Cameron had pledged to dismantle the hated Ofcom – I mean hated 
by  News  International.  He  said  that  it  was  part  of  the  Tories’  cutting  back  of  the

we know it.
When  I  subsequently  learned  that  the  team  supporting  the  Conservative  Party’s 
media  policy  developments  were  the  same  team  and  the  same  people  who  were 
helping Mr Murdoch to draft his speeches, including the MacTaggart lecture, I didn’t 
have to go very far to put two and two together to realise that this coincidence of 
policy had slightly greater meaning and that there was, in fact, a sort of organic link 
between the two, which is why I said what I did”.

2.132  Lord Mandelson’s public comments contrast with those which he later expressed on the issue 
in his autobiographical book, The Third Man, which was published in the following year. He 
wrote:189

“At his [Mr Brown’s] urging I spoke out on that issue publicly on a couple of occasions 
following the Sun’s switch. In fact, I suspected that the real reason for the change was 
simpler, and in a way even more discouraging. The Sun was a mass market paper. It 
saw its interests as backing a winner. While I was still not convinced, or at least not 
ready  to  accept,  that  a  Tory  victory  at  the  next  election  was  inevitable,  given  the 
yawning gap we would have to make up in the opinion polls, it was certainly looking 
that way” (emphasis added).

2.133  Questioned  about  the  apparent  inconsistency,  he  said  that  his  two  statements  were  not 
mutually exclusive identifying two reasons why he thought that The Sun would have wanted 
to support the Conservatives: a desire to back the likely winner and commercial self-interest 
of its proprietor. Lord Mandelson said:190

“First of all, I chose my words in finishing this book in 2010 without any prescience 
that I might be poring over it line by line, word by word with you in the course of 
justice, but secondly, and more seriously, two things were operating here, in my view: 
one, the Conservatives looked as if they were on the up and with a good chance of 
winning the election, and the Murdochs wouldn’t ignore it.
Secondly, they would have seen very clearly that their commercial interests would 
have been suited more by a Conservative victory, given what Mr Cameron was saying 
in his own public speeches, than they would with a further Labour government, you 
know.”

2.134  Pointing to The Sun’s campaigns for a referendum on Europe and about “Broken Britain”, Mr 
Brown said that The Sun had never really supported him: “… at no point in these three years 
that I was Prime Minister did I ever feel I had the support of the Sun”.191 Nevertheless, he 
identified a real change and felt that, under James Murdoch, News International adopted an 
“aggressive public agenda” and sought to put its own commercial interests first. He thought 
the Conservative Party went along with the media policies which News International sought:192

“News International had a public agenda. What’s remarkable about what happened 
in the period of 2009 and 2010 is that News International moved from being – I think

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Iit was under James Murdoch’s influence, if I may say so – to having an aggressive 
public agenda. They wanted not only not just to buy BSkyB, of course; they wanted to 
change the whole nature of the BBC. They wanted to change Ofcom, they wanted to 
change the media impartiality rules, they wanted to change the way we dealt with 
advertising so that there was more rights for the media company to gain advertisers. 
They wanted to open up sporting events so that Sky could bid for them in a way that 
– they were perfectly entitled to put this agenda. That was the agenda they were 
putting publicly. I think what became a problem for us was that on every one of these 
single issues, the Conservative Party went along with the policy, whereas we were 
trying to defend what I believe was the public interest.” (emphasis added)

2.135  Whatever  the  reaction  of  the  Conservative  Party  to  James  Murdoch’s  views  about  media 
policy in the United Kingdom (and they are explored below), for his part Mr Brown reached the 
point where he felt it was no longer worth talking to News International about the subject:193

“It  became  very  clear  in  the  summer  of  2009,  when  Mr  Murdoch  junior  gave  the 
MacTaggart  lecture,  that  News  International  had  a  highly  politicised  agenda  for 
changes that were in the media policy of this country, and there seemed to me very 
little point in talking to them about this.”

2.136  Mr Brown provided an eleven point note to the Inquiry containing information and quotations 
from the Murdochs and Conservatives on which he relied in support of his view that “the 
Conservatives in opposition and in Government shaped their policy to match the demands 
of NewsCorp – on Ofcom, on the BBC, on TV advertising, on regulation and on the proposed 
takeover of BskyB”.194

2.137  Mr Cameron rejected the allegation:195

“To respond generally, and frankly it is absolute nonsense from start to finish. I think 
where it comes from is obviously Gordon Brown was very angry and disappointed 
that  the  Sun  had  deserted  him,  and  as  a  result,  in  my  view,  he  has  cooked  up  an 
entirely specious and unjustified conspiracy theory to try and, I don’t know, justify his 
anger.
But I’ve taken the time to look through the individual parts of policy that he points to, 
and in almost every case it is complete nonsense.
Just to take a couple of examples, he makes the point about the listing of sporting 
events and particularly the Ashes, and actually it was the Labour government, his 
government, that delisted the Ashes. He makes a point about us taking a particular 
view  on  product  placement.  Again,  it  was  a  Labour  government  that  started  the 
process of changing the rules on product placement under his oversight.
On the BBC, as I’ve argued before, my position on the BBC is not the same as James 
Murdoch’s position on the BBC. I support the BBC, I support the licence fee.
So  the  Conservative  Party,  I  think,  will  be  submitting  a  piece-by-piece  response  to 
this because it is complete nonsense, but I’m very happy to go through the individual 
parts. But, as I’ve said before, there was no overt deal for support, there was no covert 
deal, there were no nods and winks. There was a Conservative politician, me, trying

but not trading policies for that support. And when you look at the detail of this, as I 
say, it is complete nonsense.”

David Cameron’s media policy and manifesto

2.138  Having identified the stance taken by Mr Brown on the one hand and Mr Cameron on the 
other, the matter can perhaps be left there. What will be important, however, is to examine 
whether (and, if so, to what extent) the allegation that the relationship between the press 
(and, more particularly, News International) might legitimately be argued to have affected 
public policy decisions of the new administration. It is therefore appropriate to consider Mr 
Cameron’s media policy and relevant parts of his general election manifesto. In doing so this 
subsection concentrates on policy towards the BBC and Ofcom. The BskyB bid is considered 
elsewhere in this Report.196

2.139  By the time of the general election of 2010, the Conservative Party’s manifesto contained 
only a single paragraph about media policy and that concerned local media, particularly local 
television:197

“Our  plans  to  decentralise  power  will  only  work  properly  if  there  is  a  strong, 
independent  and  vibrant  local  media  to  hold  local  authorities  to  account.  We  will 
sweep away the rules that stop local newspapers owning other local media platforms 
and create a new network of local television stations”.

2.140  Of relevance to the Conservative Party’s policy towards the BBC, the manifesto contained 
a pledge relevant to its financing to: “ensure the National Audit Office has full access to the 
BBC’s accounts”. So far as Ofcom was concerned, the general pledges to “cut the quango 
state” and “any quangos that do not perform a technical function or a function that requires 
political impartiality, or act independently to establish facts” were of relevance as is explained 
below.198

2.141  The principles underlying Mr Cameron’s approach to media policy were stated by him to be: “…
the need for a strong BBC, backed by the licence fee; plurality of provision; proportionate, not 
artificial, rules on media ownership; and a greater role for local television”.199 That statement 
of broad principles left plenty of scope as to the detail and during opposition Mr Cameron 
and his shadow cabinet colleagues debated and explored what that detail should be.

The BBC

2.142  In March 2008 the Conservative Party published a discussion document, “Plurality in a new 
media age”, setting out its then current thinking. It entertained a particularly controversial

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Iidea as to the use to which the BBC licence fee might be put, known as “top slicing”, which 
was described in the document in these terms:200

“One option is to consider whether other organisations should be allowed to bid for 
small parts of the licence fee. This would ensure a plurality of provision in key genres, 
such as daytime children’s TV and current affairs. However such a model would need 
to avoid the risk of distorting the commercial television market by mixing public and 
commercial funding, so it may be preferable for it to fund new channels rather than 
“top up” funding of existing channels.”

2.143  In October of the same year Mr Cameron wrote an article about The Sun which was published 
under the headline “Tory chief hits out – Bloated BBC out of touch with viewers”. It contained 
both praise for and criticism of the BBC, expressing particular concern about the negative 
impact which the BBC could have on small private sector competitors and proposing rules to 
prevent that from happening. In support of the BBC he wrote:

“I am a slightly rare creature – a lifelong Conservative who is a fan of the BBC.
I don’t just mean the quality stuff …
If I tot it all up: rummaging around the BBC news website, Radio 4 every morning, 
Radio 5 on a Sunday, The Big Cat Diaries and whatever Andrew Davies has written up 
recently, I get a huge amount from the full range of what the BBC has to offer.
And yes, I even approve of the way the BBC is funded.”

2.144  Mr Cameron then critically observed that:201

“We’ve all seen in our own constituencies small internet businesses, often involved in 
education or other information provision, working away to create a market, to make 
some money, and then the BBC comes along and squish, like a big foot on an ant, that 
business goes out”.

He proposed:

“… a better set of rules that stops the BBC from charging in … and actually putting 
other people who are struggling to provide a market, out of work”.

2.145  In a significant speech to the Oxford Media Conference in January 2009, Ed Vaizey, then Shadow 
Culture  Minister,  expressed  support  in  principle  for  the  BBC  but  made  clear  Conservative 
concerns about competition, the breadth of the BBC’s activities, costs, funding, regulation 
and  management.  What  he  said  merits  full  quotation  because  it  articulates  Conservative 
thinking at that time:202

“We are fans of the BBC. In an uncertain world, the BBC provides a great resource 
for publicly-funded high-quality content. When looking for a solution to the future 
of public service broadcasting, we want one that is the least damaging to the BBC’s 
integrity.

1202

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Although we believe in plurality in public service broadcasting, we do not believe 
the solution to the challenges presented by the internet age is necessarily to try and 
create another BBC. Having said that, it is equally important that the BBC stop acting 
like a friendly monopolist, making noises about partnerships, and engages seriously 
in discussions about how to ensure plurality in public service broadcasting.
On other matters: while we support the licence fee, and believe it is the best way to 
fund the BBC for the foreseeable future, we believe the level of the licence fee is at the 
top end of what is acceptable to the public.
The current settlement – which began in 2006 and lasts to 2012 – built in increases of 
13 – 15% over that period. That was a generous settlement when times were good. 
It may start to look prohibitive as times get increasingly bad. The BBC will have to 
think very hard about whether substantial licence fee increases can be justified in the 
coming years.
The  BBC  Trust,  under  Sir  Michael  Lyons,  has  done  a  good  job,  and  I  would  like  to 
congratulate him. So what follows is not personal, it is, as they say, business. We think 
that there needs to be a clearer divide between the regulation and management of 
the BBC. The BBC and the BBC Trust should be clearly separate. The BBC should have 
its  own  chairman,  who  can  cheer  lead  for  the  Corporation,  while  the  head  of  the 
regulator  gets  on  with  regulating.  A  truly  independent  regulator  would  provide  a 
genuine voice for the licence fee payer.
Moving on from that, the expansion of the BBC into areas where the private sector is 
already working needs to be carefully watched. Our watchword will be simple – if the 
private sector is already doing a good job in the area, or is developing a market in an 
area, the BBC should be prevented from going in with all guns blazing.
Finally, there is the issue of costs. The Ross/Brand row was not just about bad taste, 
though of course that was important. It was also about the huge amount of money 
the BBC is paying Jonathan Ross and other stars. A public service broadcaster with 
guaranteed revenue shouldn’t compete with the private sector on top talent salaries. 
In fact, I would go further and say the BBC actually pushes up the price of talent with 
its interventions. So we will ensure that the BBC publishes fully audited accounts which 
will include details of the salaries of all its top talent. The BBC should be prepared to 
defend salary and indeed all expenditure decisions it makes.”

2.146  Significantly, Mr Vaizey went on to make clear that the Conservatives were already moving 

away from the idea of top-slicing the BBC’s licence fee. He said:203

“There  are  the  solutions  that  involve  the  BBC  –  straightforward  top-slicing  of  the 
licence  fee;  partnerships  with  the  BBC  and  BBC  Worldwide,  or  by  using  money 
ring-fenced for digital switchover; or the sharing  of resources such as studios  and 
technology.
Then  there  are  the  market  solutions  –  a  merger  with  Five,  with  BBC  Worldwide, 
changing the terms of trade, or a combination of these.
We have been careful not to rule out any solution. But as I have indicated, we are 
less convinced about a solution that involves top slicing of the licence fee.” (emphasis 
added)

1203

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I2.147  Two months later, in March 2009, in the context of an increasingly difficult economic climate, 
Mr Cameron personally returned to the question of the BBC’s funding. He announced that a 
Conservative Government would freeze the licence fee:204

“... solving Labour’s Debt Crisis by making sure government lives within its means and 
delivers more for less. And it’s not just government that has to live within its means 
– we all do.
So  today,  I  want  to  make  an  announcement  that  shows  our  expectation  that 
government and all taxpayer-funded institutions should start leading by example.
The  BBC  is  one  of  our  most  important  national  institutions.  It  plays  a  vital  role  in 
bringing the country together, and I want to see it prosper and succeed and continue 
to be a fantastic cultural asset for Britain.
But it also needs to maintain public support, and I want to see it leading by example 
at a time when the whole country is tightening its belt.
And so I can announce today that we would freeze the BBC licence fee for one year.

I think that would be an important signal to the country of the need for all public 
institutions, in these difficult economic circumstances, to do more with less.”

2.148  In  April  2009,  the  Rt  Hon  Jeremy  Hunt  MP  launched  a  review  of  the  creative  industries 
which was chaired by former BBC Director General, Greg Dyke. It was one of a number of 
Conservative Party task forces formed in Opposition. Its work was still ongoing at the time 
of the general election. Elisabeth Murdoch, as CEO and Chairman of the Shine Group, was a 
member of the task force, one amongst a number of eminent industry figures.205

2.149  In October 2009, Mr Hunt told the Financial Times that he did not support Labour’s plan for 
state supported local television news on ITV, financed by top slicing the licence fee. On the 
topic of the ambit of the BBC’s activities and competition he also said:206

“It might sound well and good for [the BBC] to have, say, an angling website, but if 
it drove out of business every angling magazine in the country, you would have to 
question if it was the right sort of thing to do”.

2.150  It was Mr Hunt also ultimately made clear that the Conservatives had rejected top slicing. On 
the Conservative Party website, he posted: “on top-slicing… We floated this idea two years 
ago and rejected it”.207

2.151  In  the  result,  when  in  power,  the  Coalition  Government  froze  the  BBC  licence  fee  as  Mr 
Cameron had promised to do. Mr Cameron was keen to point out that the imposition of a 
freeze left the BBC better off than many in the current climate of austerity and that the policy 
had fallen far short of what James Murdoch was advocating:208

“… We froze the licence fee, much to the anger of James Murdoch, who I think – I think 
the Chancellor George Osborne [said] thought that it should have been cut. So we had

1204

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIour own policy on the BBC licence fee which I think had been fair and reasonable to 
the BBC when other organisations have had their budgets cut be considerably more.
So, again, this part of the conspiracy theory I think has absolutely no weight at all”.

2.152  Mr  Cameron  rejected  the  suggestion  that  in  imposing  the  freeze  he  had  been  meeting 

Mr Murdoch half way. He said:209

“I think it’s quite difficult to argue, at a time when you know if you get into government 
you’re going to have to be making spending reductions, that you’re going to see the 
BBC licence fee go up and up and up, and I think we had a consistent and long-term 
argument, which very much flowed from my own views formed at Carlton, that the 
BBC  needed  to  be  strong,  it  needed  the  backing  of  the  licence  fee.  I  do  think  the 
BBC had gone into areas it shouldn’t have done, and I mention that in some of my 
evidence, but I think this is a fair settlement for the BBC and it’s certainly not one that 
James Murdoch supported.”

2.153  Mr Osborne recalled James Murdoch’s reaction to the decision to freeze the licence fee in 

these terms:210

“Well,  I  remember  –  this  was  a  very  specifically  about  the  BBC  licence  fee,  rather 
than – as I say, James Murdoch would often let us have his views in public as well as 
in private about his view about the BBC, but specifically about the licence fee and our 
decision in October 2010 to freeze the licence fee but not to dismantle it, and indeed 
to, in effect, continue for the next five or six years with the current structure of BBC 
funding.

Now, as I say in this statement, I cannot remember exactly how this conversation 
took place, and it may well have been on the phone, because it’s not obvious that 
there was a meeting where this would have had – but I have a pretty clear memory 
of him being quite angry about our – the decision we had taken, and I explained to 
him why I thought it was the right decision and why, in any case – you know, we had 
always made it clear that we were not setting out to dismantle the BBC or radically 
cut the licence fee or distribute the licence fee in a different way, but he was clearly 
disappointed with that decision”.

2.154  Commenting on James Murdoch’s 2009 MacTaggart lecture, Mr Osborne later made clear 
how significant were the differences between the Conservative Party and Mr Murdoch on 
the BBC:211

“I disagreed with him, basically, and certainly David Cameron also disagreed with 
him, and I think – you know, he had been agitating for some dramatic change in the 
funding of the BBC or the structure of the BBC and he was not going to get that from 
the Conservatives”.

Ofcom

2.155  The attitude adopted by Mr Cameron to Ofcom has to be viewed in the overall context of 
his policy on quangos generally which, in his words, was “to redistribute power away from 

209 p90, lines 1-12, David Cameron, ibid

211 p25, lines 20-24, George Osborne, ibid

1205

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Iunaccountable institutions and back to the people”. Explaining his approach, and singling out 
Ofcom as an example, he said during the course of a major speech delivered on 9 July 2009:212

“I  have  asked  the  Shadow  Cabinet  to  review  every  independent  public  body  that 
currently sits within their portfolio. For each one, they will be asking the key questions:
Does this organisation need to exist?
If  its  functions  are  necessary,  which  of  them  should  be  carried  out  in  a  directly 
accountable way within the department?
And which, if any, should be carried out independently, at arm’s length from political 
influence?
If  there  really  is  a  need  for  an  independent  quango,  how  can  we  make  sure  it  is 
as small as possible, operating with maximum efficiency, frugality and respect for 
taxpayers’ money?
That process of review will go on up to and beyond the election. But today, I want to 
give you an idea of the scale of change we envisage by setting out what our approach 
would mean for three specific quangos.
OFCOM is the regulator for the communications industry, and it’s clear that it has 
an  important  technical  function.  It  monitors  the  plurality  of  media  provision  for 
consumers. It licenses the spectrum in the UK. And it sets the charges and the price 
caps for BT’s control of so much of the industry’s infrastructure. OFCOM also has an 
enforcement  function  –  ruling  on  breaches  of  the  broadcasting  code  for  instance. 
These matters relate to the operations of private companies in a commercial market 
and it is therefore right that they are free from political influence.
But Jeremy Hunt has concluded that OFCOM currently has many other responsibilities 
that are matters of public policy, in areas that should be part of a national debate, for 
example the future of regional news or Channel 4. These should not be determined 
by an unaccountable bureaucracy, but by minsters [sic] accountable to Parliament.
So with a Conservative Government, OFCOM as we know it will cease to exist. Its remit 
will be restricted to its narrow technical and enforcement roles. It will no longer play a 
role in making policy. And the policy-making functions it has today will be transferred 
back fully to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.” (emphasis added)

2.156  It  is  important  to  note  from  the  speech  that  although  Mr  Cameron  was  proposing  that 
“Ofcom as we know it will cease to exist” what he was referring to was the repatriation of 
policy functions back to a central Government department. There was no proposal to dilute 
Ofcom’s technical regulatory functions which the speech expressly recognised should remain 
with Ofcom and at arm’s length from political influence.

2.157  Mr Cameron explained that the decision to use Ofcom as an example was simply a matter of 
his familiarity with it and had nothing to do with any external influence. He also pointed out 
that at the time Ofcom was the subject of criticism from diverse quarters:213

“One of the reasons I picked Ofcom was because of my own experience from television 
of remembering what the Independent Television Commission had done, the ITC, the 
precursor of Ofcom, and also remembering the sort of levels of pay that there were in 

212 pp38-39, para 113, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Witness-Statement-of-David-

1206

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIthe ITC compared with Ofcom, and I did think Ofcom was quite a good example of a 
quango that had got too big, too expensive, and the pay levels were pretty excessive.
I would just make the point – I’ll shut up in a second – but at this time Ofcom was 
being actually roundly attacked on this basis by ITV, by the BBC, with which it had 
almost nothing to do, and also by commentators on the left of politics like Andrew 
Rawnsley, who were all saying Ofcom seems to have got too big and too bureaucratic.
So this was an agenda that was very limited to my own views, not in any way proposed 
or dictated by others”.

2.158  Mr  Osborne  confirmed  that  the  Conservative  Party’s  concerns  about  Ofcom  were  those 
which it had about quangos in general and did not relate to its media regulatory function:214

“Q.  [James Murdoch] was also agitating for the neutering, if not quite the dismantling 
of Ofcom. Did that chime at all with your policy?”
A.  I never discussed with him Ofcom and I don’t remember personally being involved in 
any great internal discussion within the Conservative Party about the future of Ofcom.
There was a general concern that Ofcom had become, like many Quangos, rather 
bloated,  but  that  was  not  a  complaint  about  the  function  of  Ofcom,  just  that  like 
many parts of government, that there had not been a proper regard for cost.”

2.159  In the result, Mr Cameron explained the impact of Coalition Government on Ofcom policy:215

“Q.  To take the story forward, as it were, is this right, that the reason this policy was not 
enacted was that in the pragmatic realities of the Coalition government it wasn’t possible.
A.  That’s  right.  I  wasn’t  involved  in  the  detailed  negotiation  of  the  Coalition 
agreement, but some policies made it through, others didn’t, and I suspect this is one 
that we didn’t get agreement on, but we have taken action on pay levels in quangos 
and we have tried to restrict them”.

The 2010 General Election campaign

2.160  The  2010  election  campaign  of  course  involved  all  of  the  contenders  doing  their  utmost 
to  get  their  competing  political  messages  across  using  the  media,  including  new  media, 
and  otherwise.  Mr  Cameron  had  won  the  much  coveted  support  of  News  International’s 
politically variable titles. He had secured the ‘full throttled’ support of the centre right press 
and enjoyed the support of those other politically uncommitted media titles, the Economist 
and the Financial Times. But the endorsement of The Sun did not bring outright victory.

2.161  The political commentator Andrew Neil attributed the outcome to a number of factors: the 
declining political influence of The Sun; the lack of a long period of sustained press support for 
Mr Cameron before the election; the overshadowing of newspapers generally by television 
and,  in  particular,  the  introduction  for  the  first  time  in  the  United  Kingdom,  of  televised 
leaders’ debates during the campaign. Thought provokingly, he wrote:216

1207

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I“I have already referred (para 4) to the fact that, despite the overwhelming endorsement 
of what we still refer to as Fleet Street, Mr Cameron was unable to win an overall 
majority in 2010, even though the circumstances were widely regarded as propitious 
for the Tories. The Sun is a shadow of the political influence it enjoyed in the 1980s, 
peaking in the close-run election of 1992. In the 1997 and 2001 elections it largely 
piggy-backed on the Blair landslides: it needed to back Mr Blair to show it was in touch 
with its readers much more than Mr Blair needed its backing (though he did not realise 
that at the time since he was still obsessed with what had happened to Neil Kinnock).
The Sun was following the crowd rather than telling it what to think. In 2005 the Sun 
was largely irrelevant because it took so long to make up its mind and by then had 
become half-hearted in its support of New Labour. In 2010 it backed Mr Cameron, 
though  only  in  the  autumn  before  a  spring  election,  which  did  not  give  it  time  to 
get  strongly  behind  him.  Mr  Cameron’s  hopes  of  an  overall  majority  faded  the 
more the Sun cheer-led for him; he did not win. Like other newspapers the Sun was 
overshadowed by the leaders’ debates on prime-time TV and unfolding events on the 
news channels, replayed every night to much larger audiences on network news. The 
Guardian and other left-leaning papers backed the Liberal Democrats: they lost seats.
Newspapers  and  their  proprietors  still  have  what  many  regard  as  an  inordinate 
influence  on  our  politics  because  politicians  chose  to  confer  it  on  them,  despite 
increasing evidence it is not merited. Press proprietor-politician relationships will be 
transformed, many would say for the better, when the political elite realise that the 
emperors have no clothes, or are at most scantily clad.”

2.162  Mr Osborne agreed that the support of The Sun, although important, was not, and probably 

had never been, determinative, saying:217

“… I think the endorsement of the Sun has been elevated to almost mythical status. It 
was just one of a whole range of things we felt we had to get right in the run up to a 
General Election, and ultimately, if we had not had the endorsement of the Sun I think 
we still would have gone on and done well in the General Election”.

2.163  He further explained why he thought that the role played by support from the Economist and 

the Financial Times was significant:

“I remember also that it was significant we had the endorsement of the Financial 
Times and the Economist, both publications I think previously at various points had 
supported  the  Labour  Party.  They  don’t  have  mass  readerships,  but  they  bring  a 
different kind of cachet.”

Before concluding:218

“So I think in all this process, and I think maybe it stems back to the 1992 election and 
some of the mythology around that – there is this feeling that the Sun endorsement 
is all you need to win a general election, and I would say it is far from that, and I 
certainly think you could win an election without the endorsement of the Sun”.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.	 Prime	Minister	Cameron:	2010-present
3.1 

There has been a significant and inevitable diminution in Mr Cameron’s personal engagement 
with the media once in office. Comparison of the lists of meetings which he provided for 
the periods as Leader of the Opposition and as Prime Minister showed that the number of 
contacts halved from approximately 26 meetings or interviews per month to 13. There was 
a simple and compelling explanation for this change in the tempo of media engagement, as 
Mr Cameron explained:219

“As I say, when I was elected, I did try to do less of this and try to have more of a 
distance, try to make sure – because genuinely when you’re in opposition, what are 
you doing? You’re campaigning, you’re drawing up policies, you’re trying to convince 
people. In government, it is and should be different. You should be spending your time 
governing, not talking about governing, so I did try to create some more distance, but 
as I explained earlier I think it’s very difficult because of these daily battles that you 
fight”.

3.2 

It is clear that Mr Cameron did very consciously change his approach to the press between 
Opposition and Government. He had some observations about the process:220

“Yes. I think it’s right that in government you’re making real decisions rather than just 
policy ideas and campaigns, so it’s more important that what you do is done properly. 
And that’s why you have special advisers’ codes, ministerial codes and all the rest of 
it. But I do think there is – when you’re leader of the opposition, and I did the job for 
five years, it’s only in the last year you get the sort of Civil Service machine starting to 
talk to you about how you’d translate your structure and your processes into Number 
10 Downing Street, and I think there could be a strength in – I don’t believe in having 
a sort of official opposition office, as it were, but I think there could be a strength in 
having earlier discussions between the Cabinet Secretary or the Permanent Secretary 
at Number 10 with a new leader of the opposition, just to make them aware of some 
of the processes and practices that might assist them in the work that they do and 
avoiding any conflicts and the rest of it.”

3.3 

3.4 

The  latter  is  an  interesting  point.  I  can  see  that  it  might  even  have  a  potential  to  reduce 
the risk, which Mr Campbell felt had eventuated in 1997, of an opposition  party carrying 
the media tactics of Opposition into Government. The same outcome, however, can also be 
approached (or assisted) by a more open and transparent approach to the press. I shall return 
to this issue when analysing possible ways forward.

Asked whether media engagement in Government occupied time at the expense of policy 
formation, leadership and Government, Mr Cameron described how he sought to arrange his 
private office at No 10 Downing Street to reflect the extra distance from the media which he 
sought so as to be able to concentrate on Government:221

“It  shouldn’t,  but  it  can.  I  think  the  way  I’ve  explained  the  24-hour  news  agenda, 
when I arrived in Downing Street, I did think that the set-up was quite geared to 24-
hour news. It felt too much like a newsroom, and that’s what the press department

of arrangements where you can think, take decisions, prepare for decisions properly, 
structure your day so you’re not permanently in a sort of news warfare mode, if I can 
put it that way.”

3.5 

The  risk  which  Mr  Cameron  was  seeking  to  avoid,  and  which  he  graphically  described  in 
the quotation as news warfare mode, was of spending a disproportionate amount of time 
engaging with what is now a truly 24 hour, multi-media news cycle. It is the challenge which 
faces all current and future politicians. Establishing and maintaining both healthy boundaries 
and sufficient distance in this environment is not easy when what is published and broadcast 
can, at least over time, be so influential to a political party’s fortunes. Mr Cameron accepted 
that he had not always been wholly successful in resisting the demands of the 24 hour news 
cycle. This was the exchange with Counsel to the Inquiry:222

“Q.  You refer to having a bit more distance. That depends, I suppose, on each party 
to the debate, as it were, having a sense of propriety as to what is right and where 
the boundaries are. Are we agreed about that?
A.  I think that’s right, but distance is also about for the politician, and this relates 
to  the  issue  of  the  24-hour  news  cycle.  There  is  a  difficulty  in  –  I’m  not  expecting 
sympathy for this, but there’s a difficulty in politics that you are fighting a sort of 
permanent battle of issues being thrown at you hour by hour where responses are 
demanded incredibly quickly, and it can, if you’re not careful, take up all your energy 
in  dealing  with  that,  and  that  is  hopeless,  because  if  that’s  what  you  spend  your 
time doing, you will never reform our schools, cut our deficit, deal with our economic 
problems and all the rest of it.
When I say distance, partly what I mean is that the politicians, and particularly prime 
ministers and Cabinet ministers, have to get out of the 24-hour news cycle, not try and 
fight every hourly battle, and focus on long-term issues and be prepared sometimes 
to take a hit on a story they don’t respond to so quickly.
That’s very easy to say that, but I did actually try on getting into Number 10 Downing 
Street to do that. I’m not sure it’s always been totally successful, but that’s part of 
what I mean by distance. It means not sitting under a 24-hour news television screen 
looking at the ticker and worrying about what’s happening every hour. If you do that, 
you get completely buried by the daily news agenda.” (emphasis added)

3.6 

Focusing more specifically on newspapers, Mr Cameron explained how technological change 
has affected the content of printed news coverage, forcing it away from its historic model 
which focused on reporting the previous day’s news:223

“… I think a lot of evidence that’s been put forward in the sessions you’ve had where 
people have talked about the growth of the 24-hour news culture, the fact that things 
move so fast that I think newspapers have been put in a difficult position, because 
the news has been made and reported long before they reach their deadlines and 
they  publish  their  papers  the  next  day,  so  I  think  newspapers  have  moved  more 
towards trying to find impact, trying to find an angle on a story, rather than, as would 
have been the case before 24-hour news and all the rest of it, of just reporting what 
happened the day before.

1210

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansISo I think there has been a change, but I think that’s quite a lot to do with technology 
and the development of the media rather than anything else.”

3.7 

From the politician’s perspective he considered this development to have been certainly one 
which has brought challenges:224

“I  think  from  the  politicians’  point  of  view,  and  particularly  perhaps  from  the 
government’s point of view, it’s sometimes a change for the worse, because if there’s 
a big announcement, something we think is very important, that gets announced on 
the television, it gets picked over by the 24-hour news, and it’s quite understandable 
that the newspapers, by the time they come out the next day, have to find something 
different,  and  I  completely  understand  why  they  want  to  do  that,  but  from  the 
perspective of trying to explain to the country why you’re making difficult decisions, 
why you’re reforming the health service in this way, why you’re trying to cut the deficit 
in that way and get across more what it is you actually decided to do rather than an 
endless analysis of what the motives were or what the splits were or whatever, but 
politicians will always complain about this sort of thing, so I wouldn’t put too much 
weight on it”.

3.8  Mr Osborne explained how he and Mr Cameron had drawn lessons from New Labour’s media 
strategy in the early days of the New Labour Government and confirmed that there was less 
emphasis in Government on fighting for every headline than there had been in Opposition. 
He pointed out, though, that the proliferation of news sources has in any event now made 
such an endeavour impossible. He said:225

“This is going to sound like talking my own book, but it also, I think, is genuinely the 
case. I think New Labour were very aggressive, when they became the government, 
in pursuing the media management techniques they had developed in opposition. 
And they had developed those techniques in opposition, to be fair to them, because 
of the way people like Neil Kinnock had been treated by all the press beforehand.
Now, we learnt, in a way, from that. We were – we came of political age – myself, 
David Cameron and others – during that political period, and we felt too that that 
government in its early years had been too obsessive about tomorrow’s headline and 
tried to control every aspect of the media.
That’s not to say when we came into government, we didn’t want to have a good 
and effective media operation, but we were more relaxed about fighting for every 
single headline or fighting for every news bulletin, and I think there is also partly an 
understanding on our behalf that in what has become, even over that period, a much 
more fragmented media, it is impossible to manage every single headline or fight for 
every headline. In the end, we had a belief that – we came into government, we had 
to set out some difficult things we needed to do and we would trust ultimately to the 
judgment of the public but also trust to the judgment of the media, even if along the 
line you got some bad headlines.
Certainly, I have been more relaxed as Chancellor of the Exchequer in that early period 
than I would have been as Shadow Chancellor about some the headlines we’ve had.”

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I3.9 

That was not to say, however, that there had not still been a close relationship between the 
press and the Coalition Government under Mr Cameron’s leadership. Mr Osborne described 
calling editors and proprietors often:226

“… I often make calls to editors and proprietors after Major Treasury announcements 
and  fiscal  events  which  the  diary  records  as  a  single  block  of  time  for  “calls  to 
editors”…”

3.10  Mr Cameron candidly accepted that political news management strategies had not always 
been unambiguously in the public interest, and not just those of other political parties. When 
asked whether he had seen evidence of attempts to control the news agenda by politicians in 
his own party through favouritism and anonymous briefings, he replied:227

“Yes. These things do happen and it’s deeply regrettable. I think as long as there’s 
been a press and politicians these things happen. But it is very regrettable, it often 
makes running a political party more difficult, running a government more difficult. 
It’s deeply destructive.
I think there are degrees of this. Of course, you know, some politicians have journalists 
they have a particular good relationship with, they think they’re going to understand 
a particular speech or a particular idea better than others, and in this world where the 
newspapers aren’t reporting yesterday’s news, because that’s already been reported, 
clearly newspapers are looking for something special, they’re looking for a particular 
angle or a particular story.
So there are responsible ways of handling media relations in that way, but briefing 
against people, doing people down, there are some dreadful things that have been 
done  in  politics  on  both  sides  in  recent  years,  and  they’re  very,  very  regrettable.” 
(emphasis added)

3.11  As for a solution to the problem, Mr Cameron agreed that there was no single panacea, that 
a mixture of rules and culture were required and that political leaders themselves needed to 
put a halt to bad practice and a poor culture.228

3.12  A good start has already been made so far as transparency is concerned. On 15 July 2011, Mr 
Cameron was responsible for the amendment of the Ministerial Code requiring Ministers to 
disclose their meetings with media proprietors, editors and senior executives. The relevant 
addendum to the Code reads:

“The  Government  will  be  open  about  its  links  with  the  media.  All  meetings  with 
newspaper  and  other  proprietors,  editors  and  senior  executives  will  be  published 
quarterly regardless of the purpose of the meeting”.

3.13  The current practice is that all Government departments compile the information required 
by the Ministerial Code set out above and give details of the month the meeting took place, 
the name of the individual and organisation meeting the Minister, and the purpose of the 
meeting. Each list is available for public inspection on the relevant departmental website (as 
part of a wider list of Ministers’ meetings with external organisations), as well as via links on

on the respective websites.229

3.14  Mr Cameron has made public the fact of his Ministerial meetings with media proprietors, 
editors and senior executives since the 2010 General Election, regardless of the nature of 
the meeting.230 It has been an important step forward and transparency is an issue to which 
I shall return.

3.15  Amendment  of  the  Ministerial  Code  was  undoubtedly  a  very  important  step  towards 
affording the transparency that is going to be vital if public trust in the relationship between 
our national press and politicians is to be rebuilt. An important issue is whether it would 
be desirable to go further. On that question Mr Cameron thought that there was room for 
improvement. His view was:231

“I think there are improvements we can make here. I think the idea that someone 
suggested  of  a  sort  of  written  note  of  every  interaction  with  every  editor,  every 
broadcast – I think that would be overly bureaucratic because most of the meetings 
are  pretty  similar.  You’re  explaining  why  you’re  in  favour  of  free  schools  and 
academies and how to get that message across, and why the policy’s a good idea. 
You’re explaining something that you’ve already published.
But where I think there is potential for improvement is in two areas. If it’s obvious 
that this is a meeting where the proprietor or the broadcasting business or what have 
you has got some, you know, commercial issues they want to raise, then I think it does 
make sense that a note is taken. Or, if in a meeting that’s really about your policies 
and your approach and the rest of it, there’s a discussion about commercial interests, 
then I think again in government, you know, under the Ministerial Code, I think it’s 
probably right that the minister or the politician should make a reference to that to 
the private secretary.”

3.16  He  also  warned  against  an  excessively  bureaucratic  approach  which  might  easily  become 

counter-productive:232

“The problem with all this is the more rules and codes we create, the more difficult 
it is to make sure in every instance that people abide by them. I don’t want to create 
a  system  that  doesn’t  work,  that  is  permanently  broken.  That  would  actually  sap 
the faith of the public in this whole area. But I think some modest additions to the 
Ministerial Code to deal with the two points I’ve made, I think that is something we 
could certainly look at.”

3.17 

I  have  no  hesitation  in  endorsing  the  proposal  that  consideration  should  be  given  to 
enhancing the Ministerial Code so as to require a note to be taken at meetings with media 
proprietors, editors and senior executives at which their commercial interests are discussed 
and that should such an issue be raised in the course of a meeting with a different purpose, of 
which a note is not being taken, then that issue should be reported to the Minister’s private 
secretary. Indeed, as I have said, I believe that it is appropriate to go further and I shall return

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Ito  the  concept  of  greater  transparency  when  discussing  the  appropriate  conclusions  and 
recommendations to make.

3.18  A  consequence  of  Mr  Cameron’s  contact  with  the  media  throughout  his  career,  and  in 
his  private  life,  is  that  he  has  formed  many  friendships  with  people  in  the  media.  When 
compiling the lists of those media figures with whom he had had contact both as Leader of 
the Opposition and in Government, there are some whom he had met so often that it was 
impractical to list contacts individually. Instead he identified them:233

“There is a small number of journalists who are close friends of mine and who I see 
so  frequently  that  I  have  not  included  them  systematically  in  these  lists,  namely 
Daniel Finkelstein, Alice Thomson and Sarah Vine from The Times, Xan Smiley and 
Christopher  Lockwood  from  The  Economist,  and  Robert  Hardman  from  The  Daily 
Mail. While my contacts are mainly social, they are also people with whom I discuss 
politics and particular projects, such as speeches.”

3.19  The number of such friends demonstrates that Mrs Brooks was not alone amongst media 
figures with whom Mr Cameron socialised. Mr Smiley is a neighbour of Mr Cameron’s and Mr 
Finkelstein a former Conservative Party Parliamentary candidate, giving some indication of 
the diverse ways in which Mr Cameron has formed these media friendships. It is a convenient 
point at which to emphasise that there is absolutely nothing wrong with friendships between 
politicians  and  journalists  and  that  they  will  inevitably  be  close  contact  between  the  two 
which result in friendships. That is not only perfectly normal, it is good. It is worth repeating: 
it is not friendship that is relevant to the Terms of Reference but, rather, the way in which 
what the politicians have described as ‘overly close’ relationships can impact on policy and 
the needs of transparency to ensure that this becomes apparent.

Relations with Telegraph Media Group

3.20  Naturally, Mr Cameron continued to make efforts to retain the very strong links which he 
fostered with the Telegraph Media Group (TMG) in Opposition. He has met with a number of 
senior executives and editors on a number of occasions since the election.234 Aidan Barclay’s 
business interests are very much wider than TMG and so there are additional reasons why he 
is an important person for Mr Cameron to remain in contact with. There have been two face-
to-face meetings since the election, in the period covered by disclosure to the Inquiry, which 
well illustrate how Mr Cameron has continued to engage in a mixture of formal and informal 
contact with senior media figures. On 6 July 2010 there was a meeting at No 10 Downing 
Street for general discussion followed by drinks.235 To put this meeting into context, it was 
one of a number of meetings with media proprietors and senior media executives which Mr 
Cameron had in the months immediately after he became Prime Minister.236 Mr Barclay was 
then given dinner on 18 November 2010 by Mr and Mrs Cameron, at which there was general 
discussion.237

1214

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.21  Rupert Murdoch pointed out that in contrast to Mr Barclay he had not been invited to dine 
at No 10 by Mr Cameron: “…Unlike Mr Barclay I don’t get invited to dinner at 10 Downing 
Street…”.238 It is right that Mr Murdoch does not appear to have had quite the same access to 
the Prime Minister if Mr Barclay is used as a comparator, although that is but one of a number 
of comparisons that might be made. Media proprietors certainly do enjoy a good level of 
access generally to our political leaders.

3.22 

In  addition  to  the  face-to-face  meetings,  Mr  Barclay  and  Mr  Cameron  have  continued 
occasionally to communicate by SMS text message. Only two of Mr Barclay’s post-election 
texts disclosed to the Inquiry concerned a substantive issue and reflected Mr Barclay’s interest 
in the macro-economic situation. One of Mr Barclay’s texts read:239

“David im sure your aware [sic] that the credit markets are not good and are likely 
to get worse as they all err on the side of caution faced with combination of more 
regulation Basle 3 more liquidity losses from sovereign debt the end of bank of England 
support and potential tax all at wrong time for economy given also government cuts 
I hope you don’t mind me mentioning it regards Aidan”.

3.23  The other contained advice for Mr Cameron:

“Suggest  therefor  Bank  of  England  announce  extension  to  liquidity  scheme  allow 
Banks  say  5yrs  to  implement  Basle  3  and  if  you  can  scrap  talk  of  Bank  Tax  other 
countries won’t go along with it anyway Best Aidan”240

3.24  Mr  Cameron  explained  how  this  was  one  of  a  number  of  economic  views  which  he  had 

received and, coming from informed sources, they were useful. He said:241

“Yes. I think this was the view of him, you know, not really as chairman of a newspaper 
group but as chairman of a big business heavily invested into the UK with lots of property 
and other businesses and this was his strong views about the financial situation and I 
think it’s perfectly legitimate. I get a lot of exposure to businesses’ views on these sorts 
of points, some by text, many more by the meetings I have, and that seems to me not 
a bad thing, as long as you can order them properly in your mind.”

3.25  The contact was of a kind which is unexceptionable but the use of text messaging highlights 
just how, in the age of informal electronic communications, policy issues are easily discussed 
privately without the need for a face-to-face conversation. As already discussed, Mr Cameron 
has proposed that any contact relating to the commercial interests of a media company which 
occurs should be noted, if it is pre-planned, and reported to a Minister’s private secretary if 
it occurs spontaneously. It is difficult to see any difference in principle if the same sort of 
communication takes place by text, email or telephone. I shall also return to this issue when 
discussing the way forward.242

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition IRelations with News Corporation and News International

Rupert Murdoch

3.26  The first of four post-election meetings between Mr Cameron and Rupert Murdoch took place 
on 18 May 2010, shortly after Mr Cameron became Prime Minister. Mr Cameron explained 
how the meeting came about and gave his recollection of events which was as follows:243

“The reason for Rupert Murdoch’s visit was that he was in London and in common 
with the reasons for my other meetings with newspaper proprietors and senior media 
executives,  to  set  out  the  challenges  that  I  and  my  Government  saw  the  country 
facing and our broad approach to addressing them. I also wanted to thank him for 
his support. As far as I can recall, this meeting covered similar ground to my other 
meetings  with  newspaper  proprietors  and  senior  media  executives  at  the  time.” 
(emphasis added)

3.27  Mr Murdoch recalled a short meeting at which he told Mr Cameron that his titles would be 

watching closely to ensure that campaign promises were kept:244

“…I  do  recall  that,  shortly  after  his  election,  Mr  Cameron  invited  me  in  for  tea  at 
No.10 Downing Street, he thanked me for the support of our papers; I congratulated 
him and told him that I was sure our titles would watch carefully and report whether 
he kept all of his campaign promises. The meeting lasted at most 20 minutes...”

3.28  He also recalled that Mr Coulson “was present”.245 Mr Coulson was certainly at No 10 when 
the  meeting  occurred.  He  recalled  that:  “I  met  him  when  he  arrived  and  took  him  to  the 
Prime Minister’s office. I didn’t sit in on the meeting which I think lasted around 30 minutes. 
Afterwards I met him later in the corridor and we had a brief conversation.”246

3.29  Commentators have observed that Mr Murdoch had been admitted to Number 10 otherwise 
than through the famous front door and speculated as to the reason for that, suggesting that 
there was a desire to keep the meeting low key. Mr Cameron said that he was not involved in 
the arrangements but explained that No 10 has a number of entrances which frequently are 
and have been used by visitors now and in the past by previous administrations.247 There is 
also a car park to the rear. Mr Murdoch’s evidence on the subject was somewhat equivocal, 
but a desire to avoid photographers appears to have played a part:248

“Q.  On that occasion and possibly other occasions you go in through the back door, 
is that right?

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIA.  That – yes. There are reasons for that. They always seem to – don’t want me to be 
photographed going out the front door or I don’t want to be, but it also happens to 
be a shortcut to my apartment, so it’s quite okay”.
Q.  All right. Why do you think –
A.  And the car park [sic] is usually parked behind there, there’s a car park behind 10 
and 11 Downing Street.”

3.30  Whatever the precise reason, the fact of the meeting was disclosed by Mr Cameron in his first 

quarterly release of general external meetings on 28 October 2010.249

3.31  The other three meetings included a dinner with Mayor Bloomberg, in New York, on 21 July 
2010, the News Corp summer party on 16 June 2011, which is attended by a large number of 
politicians, amongst others, and the Times CEO summit dinner at which Mr Cameron was the 
keynote speaker.250 Of the dinner in New York, Mr Coulson said:251

“The second post-election meeting with Rupert Murdoch was in New York on the day 
Mayor Bloomberg organised a party in honour of the Prime Minister. Before the party 
Rupert Murdoch met David Cameron for around half an hour. He and I met briefly 
when he arrived, but I did not sit in on the meeting. In the evening, before the dinner, 
I had a longer conversation with Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi at the drinks 
reception. From memory we mostly discussed American politics”.

3.32 

It is not surprising that Mr Murdoch and Mr Cameron have not met since July 2011 when the 
hacking scandal reached its apex. It is also right to observe that despite the election support 
afforded  by  News  International’s  titles  to  Mr  Cameron  before  the  2010  General  Election, 
there has been noticeably critical coverage in News International and other titles dating from 
around the same time.

James Murdoch

3.33 

James  Murdoch  met  the  Prime  Minister  twice  after  the  2010  General  Election.  The  first 
occasion  was  on  7  November  2010  when  Mr  Murdoch  visited  Chequers.252  The  second 
occasion was a little over a month later, on 23 December 2010 at the home of Mr and Mrs 
Brooks.253 Both occasions took place whilst News Corp’s bid to acquire BskyB was current. The 
second was two days after the sudden and dramatic events which had led to responsibility 
for considering the bid being transferred from Dr Cable to Mr Hunt. Mr Murdoch recalled a

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Ibehaviour had been unacceptable, and I imagine I expressed a hope that things would 
be dealt with in a way that was appropriate and judicial”.

3.34  Mr  Cameron’s  recollection  was  to  the  same  effect.  Having  reminded  the  Inquiry  that  he 
had  completely  recused  himself  from  the  substantive  decision  about  the  bid,  which  is  a 
fundamental consideration, he said:255

“Well, the gist was, as I explained, what Vince Cable had said, albeit privately but 
made publicly, was very embarrassing for the government, and I wanted to make 
clear, I think appropriately, that this shouldn’t have happened, that it was wrong, and 
that this issue would now be dealt with entirely properly, and I thought that was quite 
an important point to make.”

3.35  The comment was perfectly in order. However, the fact that there was mention of the bid at 
a private function and that it had not previously been made public caused speculation when 
it emerged. Mr Cameron explained why Downing Street repeatedly declined to confirm the 
fact of the supper on 23 December 2010:256

“I think what would have happened here is that before we became totally transparent 
about all these meetings, if Downing Street press office was asked about any social 
engagement or private engagement they wouldn’t normally answer those questions, 
and I think that’s what happened on this occasion. So they said, “We don’t comment 
on the Prime Minister’s private or social engagements”.

“I think the issue was pressed and in the end, I can’t remember if it was me or someone 
else, suggested, “Come on, there’s nothing to hide here, just answer the question”, but 
we’re now in a different world where all these sorts of meetings would be declared in 
the normal way, but at that stage we weren’t routinely giving out private and social 
engagements.” (emphasis added)

3.36  The encounter illustrates why transparency is needed and also why it would be prudent to 

enhance the current system of disclosure: once more, I shall return to this issue later.

Rebekah Brooks

3.37  After the 2010 General Election Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks continued to have a significant 
amount  of  both  formal  and  informal  contact.  Politicians,  like  everyone  else,  are  free  to 
choose their friends, and to be friends with whomsoever they please. What is of interest to 
the Inquiry, and what has been investigated, is whether the contact has brought with it any 
pressure or influence on the Coalition Government’s policies.

3.38  Mr Cameron had dinner with the Brooks’ on 22 May 2010.257 Mrs Brooks visited Chequers on 
three occasions: 13 June 2010, 13 August 2010 and 9 October 2010258. The last of these visits

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIwas to celebrate the Prime Minister’s birthday.259 Shortly before that, on 4 October 2010, she 
had met Mr Cameron at the Conservative Party Conference.260

3.39  Mrs Brooks hosted the dinner party on 23 December 2010, discussed above, at which there 
was  mention  between  James  Murdoch  and  Mr  Cameron  of  News  Corp’s  bid  to  acquire 
BSkyB.261 On 26 December 2010 both Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks were at a party hosted by 
Mrs Brooks’ sister in law, although both Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks recalled little contact on 
that occasion. Asked whether there was discussion of the BSkyB bid, Mr Cameron replied:262

“No,  I  don’t  think  there  was.  My  memory  is  that  Boxing  Day  was  actually  Charlie 
Brooks’ sister’s house, there was a party, I think Rebekah was there briefly. I don’t 
think there was – certainly I don’t think there was a conversation about BSkyB. I’m 
not even sure there was much of a conversation at all, but that’s my recollection”.

3.40  Mrs Brooks was similarly unsure whether there had been any conversation at all and was sure 

that the BskyB bid had not been mentioned:263

“A.  Yes, no, it’s – I’ve been asked about it before. Mr Cameron attended a Boxing 
Day mulled wine, mince pie party at my sister-in-laws, and I popped in on my way 
to another dinner and I actually don’t have any memory, because I don’t think I did 
even speak to him or Samantha that night, but my sister-in-law tells me they were 
definitely  there  for  the  party,  so  I  would  have  seen  them,  but  not  even  to  have  a 
proper conversation.
Q.  So as to the scope of any conversation, which you say wasn’t a proper conversation, 
are you sure it would not have covered the BskyB issue?
A.  Boxing Day.
A.  Definitely. Absolutely not. I mean, I don’t think there was a conversation.”

3.41  Other Cabinet Ministers also maintained the connection with News International generally 
and Mrs Brooks in particular. The most frequent such contact was with Mr Osborne who had 
six meetings with Mrs Brooks after the election, two of which were at Dorneywood.264

3.42  Turning to specific issues, the Inquiry explored with both the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon 
Theresa May MP, and the Prime Minister what role Mrs Brooks and The Sun had played in the 
decision for the Metropolitan Police to review the case of the disappearance of Madeleine 
McCann. The review had the benefit of extra financial support from the Home Office and was 
a subject of interest to a number of newspapers and their readers. The object of the review 
was to establish whether there were any other avenues of inquiry that should be pursued.265

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I3.43  On 11 May 2011, Mrs Brooks saw two of Mr Cameron’s SpAds about the review. Both she 
and Mr Mohan also spoke to the Home Secretary about it by telephone. Mrs May was able 
to explain that the decision to have the Metropolitan Police review the case was, in fact, not 
one which had been made suddenly:266

“No, a review was not ordered – was not requested or required at short notice. The 
Home Office had been discussing – first started discussing with ACPO the possibility of 
a Police Review or further police work on this – they first started discussing with ACPO 
under the previous government. So the discussion had been taking place for some 
time – it took place with ACPO initially – for ACPO to identify which police force would 
be appropriate to undertake the is work, if it was to be undertaken, and at the same 
time there were discussions taking place with the Portuguese authorities, because 
of  course,  no  UK  police  force  can  go  into  another  country  and  start  investigating; 
they  can  only  do  so  with  the  agreement,  approval  and  assistance  of  the  resident 
authorities in that country.”

3.44  She was clear that she had not been threatened with adverse coverage if she did not support 
the review by either Mrs Brooks or Mr Mohan. On the contrary, she had called them to tell 
them about developments: “I think it was a call at my instigation”. The exchange with Counsel 
to the Inquiry was as follows:267

“Q.  Did Mrs Brooks say anything about – words to this effect: that unless you ordered 
the review, you would be on the front page of the Sun until that happened?
A.  No. Neither Mrs Brooks or Mr Mohan made any indication of that sort to me. 
The  nature  of  the  telephone  conversation  was  to  alert  them  to  the  fact  that  the 
government was taking some action, that there was going to be this further work by 
the police here in the UK and to put forward the point that it was very important that 
the UK authorities were able to work with the Portuguese authorities.”

3.45  The Home Secretary did not feel that she had been pressured behind the scenes on the issue 

to take a position she would not otherwise have taken. Rather, she said:268

“I felt that the work that we were doing to look at this review had been going on for 
some time, it was coming to a fruition around this time anyway, and obviously the 
issue was a matter of public concern.”

3.46  The  Prime  Minister  similarly  had  not  felt  pressured  by  Mrs  Brooks,  whether  directly  or 
indirectly, to support and finance the review: “Pressure? No I wasn’t aware of any pressure”.269 
He had checked and confirmed that the additional central government funding that was to be 
provided to the Metropolitan Police was being properly deployed. When asked whether Mrs 
Brooks’ visit to his SpAds had been reported to him, he said:270

“I don’t recall. It might well have been. I don’t recall the exact conversations. I do 
recall, because I can see what might lie behind the question, which is: are you treating 
different investigations and campaigns fairly? And I do remember actually, as Prime 
Minister, consulting the Permanent Secretary at Number 10 about the step that the

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIpolice were about to take, backed by the government, which was to provide some 
extra funding for the investigation, and it was drawn to my attention that there is a 
special Home Office procedure for helping with particularly complex and expensive 
investigations that’s been used in various cases, and it was going to be used in this 
case  and  he  was  satisfied  that  that  was  –  that  had  been  dealt  with  properly  and 
effectively. So it’s an example, if you lie, of the importance of making sure these things 
are done properly and I believe it was.”

3.47  When it came to the influence of newspaper campaigning on the issue, Mr Cameron had 
rightly taken care to ask himself whether he was being confronted with self-interested media 
pressure or genuine public pressure:271

“Well, I mean clearly this was a very high-profile  case, and a case that a number 
of newspapers wanted to champion because their readers wanted to champion it, 
and obviously as government you have to think: are we helping with this because 
there’s media pressure or is it genuine public pressure, is there a genuine case, are 
we treating this fairly? And I did ask those questions of the Permanent Secretary at 
Number 10, and so I think we made an appropriate response. But I don’t remember 
any sort of specific pressure being put on me…” (emphasis added).

3.48  Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks did discuss the phone hacking story. Mrs Brooks recalled that 
in  the  period  after  the  Guardian’s  July  2009  story,  they  spoke  about  it  in  general  terms 
“on  occasion”  and  once  more specifically  in  late 2010 when  there was  an  increase in  the 
number of civil claims alleging phone hacking and seeking compensation. About the general 
conversations, Mrs Brooks said:272

“I think on occasion – you know, not very often, so maybe once or twice, because of 
the news and because, you know, the phone hacking story was a sort of a constant, 
or it kept coming up. We would bring it up, but in the most general terms. Maybe in 
2010, we had a more specific conversation about it, which I think is – yeah, that’s 
about right”.

3.49  On the occasion of the more specific conversation, she could recall only in general terms what 

Mr Cameron had asked:273

“I think he asked me – I think it had been in the news that day – I think it was about 
the civil cases. Maybe a new civil case had come out, and he asked me about it and I 
responded accordingly.”

3.50  As for what she had told Mr Cameron, she said:274

“It was a couple of years ago. It was a general discussion about – I think he asked me 
what the update was. I think it had been on the news that day, and I think I explained 
the story behind the news. No secret information, no privileged information; just a 
general update. I’m sorry, I can’t remember the date, but I just don’t have my records”.

1221

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I3.51  Mr Cameron had little  recollection  of the conversation but did  not deny asking questions 

about the subject:275

“I don’t really remember the specifics. I saw in her evidence that this was perhaps 
something  to  do  with  me  asking  a  question  about  some  of  these  civil  cases  and 
what was happening. I suspect it could have been that. This was an issue that was 
obviously being discussed. It was a controversial issue with all the civil cases and the 
rest of it, and I expect I could have asked some questions about that, but I don’t recall 
the specifics”.

3.52  From these imperfect recollections, it can be seen that the Prime Minister was paying attention 
to the emerging story, recognising its sensitivity, but does not appear to have focused on 
any detail. The indications are that he was provided with only general and publicly available 
information.

3.53  When, on 15 July 2011, after the story had reached its height, Mrs Brooks resigned from her 
position as Chief Executive Officer of News International, she recalled receiving a message of 
support from Mr Cameron, albeit indirectly. The exchange with Counsel to the Inquiry on the 
subject was this:276

“Q.  It has been reported in relation to Mr Cameron – but
who knows whether it’s true – that you received a message along the lines of: “Keep 
your head up.” Is that true or not?
A.  From?
Q.  From Mr Cameron, indirectly. You’ll have seen that in the Times.
A.  Yes, I did see it in the Times. Along those lines. It was more – I don’t think they 
were the exact words but along those lines.
Q.  Is the gist right, at least?
A.  Yes, I would say so. But it was indirect. It wasn’t a direct text message.
Q.  Did you also receive a message from him via an intermediary along these lines: 
Sorry I could not have been as loyal to you as I have been, but Ed Miliband had me on 
the run.” Or words to that effect?
“A.  Similar, but again, very indirectly.
Q.  So, broadly speaking, that message was transmitted to
you, was it?
A.  Yes.”

3.54 

It was but one of a number of messages of support or commiseration which she received 
from  politicians,  those  working  in  their  offices  and  others.  The  messages  from  politicians 
were all indirect and predominantly from Conservative rather than Labour politicians.277 This 
may have been more a reflection of News International’s support for the Conservatives and a 
legacy of the company’s sudden move away from Labour in 2009 than anything else.

1222

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.55  As is well known, Mrs Brooks is currently facing criminal charges in connection with allegations 
of wrongdoing at the NoTW, including in relation to phone hacking, perverting the course 
of justice and conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. As is equally well known, 
she vehemently denies wrongdoing and has declared her intention of mounting a vigorous 
defence to all charges.

Andy Coulson and the unfolding phone hacking scandal

3.56  Liberal Democrats had been highly critical of the appointment by Mr Cameron of Mr Coulson. 
It is therefore unsurprising that the question whether he should be appointed to the position 
Director of Government Communications was raised with Mr Cameron by the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP, in the early days of the coalition. Mr Clegg recalled asking 
whether it was the right thing to do although he stressed that neither he, nor Mr Cameron, 
knew then what is known now. He said:278

“A.  Yes. That is my recollection. The background to it is that we, the Liberal Democrats, 
my colleague, for instance, Chris Huhne, had been very outspoken in our criticisms of 
Andy Coulson when he was appointed to work for the Conservative Party in opposition. 
It’s self-evidently an issue. This was an individual who we had been highly critical of 
and had been critical of his appointment before the election, so, you know, it would 
have been very odd for us not to seek to straighten out our views now that we were 
suddenly and unexpectedly thrown together in government, as with so many issues.
I genuinely cannot remember the precise wording, but, you know, I said to the Prime 
Minister, I asked him, “Is this the right thing to do, given the controversy around Andy 
Coulson?” given obviously the Prime Minister was aware of my party’s views on it. 
The Prime Minister explained the reasons that he’s given publicly why he felt that he’d 
been satisfied with the responses that he’d received from Andy Coulson and he felt, as 
he’s put it, that he deserves a second chance.
Of course, a lot of the information and allegations we now know were not known 
to me or indeed the Prime Minister then. It’s quite important to remember that this 
conversation would have been quite different – we know now or think we know now 
that we didn’t know then.
And also it is important to remember that in a coalition, the Prime Minister has a 
right to make choices about who he appoints to his team which I can’t and wouldn’t 
ever seek to veto, in the same way that I am free to make appointments to my team 
which he can’t veto.
It was not a conversation which was based on the premise that somehow, you know, 
I would say, “You can’t do that”, it’s just that wasn’t the understanding of it.”

3.57  Mr Clegg was not the only person to raise the issue with Mr Cameron. The Prime Minister 
described  “a  handful  of  people”  having  done  so,  including  from  within  the  Conservative 
Party:279

“Q.  Okay. Were similar concerns expressed to you directly
by anybody else, to the best of your recollection?

1223

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition IA.  There were – you know, some people did have concerns. I can’t remember exactly 
who and when, but as I said, this was a controversial appointment. I’ve read in some 
of these books about a number of people who have made these points, but I don’t 
recall many specifics, but clearly some people did have concerns, yes.
Q.  And were they concerns expressed from within your own party?
A.  I think there might have been one or two, I think there might have been a specific 
MP, I think Andrew Tyrie. That’s not something I recall directly but something that has 
been pointed out to me, but he may have expressed concerns to me, but ...
Q.  In  terms  of  quantity,  approximately  how  many  people  fall  into  this  group  of 
expressing concerns to you?
A.  I couldn’t put a number on it, but not – you know, a handful of people, I think it 
would be.”

3.58  Lord Ashdown cautioned Ed Llewellyn, whom he knew well, to the effect that the appointment 
was a decision which the Prime Minister might well come to regret; but he did not have any 
new specific information about him. Mr Llewellyn saw no need to pass on Lord Ashdown’s 
opinion (for an opinion is all that it was) to Mr Cameron at the time, although he did so in the 
summer of 2011 when the hacking scandal peaked. The point was not new and Mr Llewellyn 
must have been well aware that Mr Cameron fully understood the position and his decision 
was perfectly reasonable.280

3.59  Contrary to some assertions that concerns were raised by a wide range of different people, 
Lord O’Donnell did not receive any complaints about Mr Coulson as he made clear in his 
evidence:281

“Neither the Deputy Prime Minister nor the royal household raised any concerns with 
me or officials either before or during Mr Coulson’s period of employment as a special 
adviser. I have to admit to being somewhat surprised to be asked about Buckingham 
Palace  when  they  have  already  clearly  said  on  no  occasion  did  any  officials  from 
Buckingham Palace raise concerns to Downing Street and indeed it is outrageous to 
suggest this. Neither were any concerns raised with my by the Prime Minister or any 
other special advisers about Mr Coulson’s conduct in previous employment.”

3.60  The question of Mr Coulson’s security clearance in Government is an issue which aroused 
much public comment. When recruited by the Conservative Party, Mr Coulson was the subject 
of a standard background check by a commercial organisation, Control Risks: this relies on 
publicly available information.282 In Government he was vetted to a level known as SC, Security 
Clearance. He was not vetted to a higher level known as DV, Developed Vetting, although he 
was in the course of the lengthy process of being assessed for this level of clearance at the 
time of his resignation.283

1224

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.61  The level of security clearance was not the decision of either Mr Cameron or Mr Coulson 
but the Civil Service.284 SC is appropriate for long term, frequent access to secret material, 
or occasional/controlled access to top secret material. DV vetting is exceptional, conducted 
only where there is a “business need” and is required solely for those who have long-term, 
frequent/uncontrolled  access  to  top  secret  material.285  Lord  O’Donnell  made  clear  that  it 
was not uncommon for people in Mr Coulson’s position to start work without DV clearance 
but then come to require it. So far as Mr Coulson was concerned, he explained that a need 
for more frequent access to top secret material than SC clearance permitted had became 
apparent as a result of issues and stories concerning terrorism. He put it this way:286

“It quite often turned out that they would start off with that view – or, in this case, 
the  Number  10  permanent  secretary  would  have  that  view  –  and  then,  as  events 
changed, they would realise – the first big terrorist event came along and then there 
would be a lot of papers which, by their nature, were all top secret, and then you 
would say, “Actually, this isn’t working, we need to give access to this”, or: “It would 
have been better if that person had access to these papers routinely, therefore we’ve 
decided ...”. And this is what happened with Mr Coulson: we decided in the light of the 
terrorist incident, the airline bomb plot, that actually it made for sense for him to be 
DV’d so we could give him regular access to these papers.
Up to then, it hadn’t been an issue because I don’t think he’d been that interested in 
those aspects of work which would have required them to have top secret access.”

3.62 

Information concerning the recent Directors of Communication and Prime Minister’s Official 
Spokesmen showed that, of six post holders, three had DV clearance when they took up their 
posts, two had it granted within around three months and the other just over seven months 
after taking up his post.287

3.63 

In any event, the process of considering Mr Coulson for DV status would not have involved a 
detailed investigation of phone hacking at the NoTW; rather it is directed at whether he was 
at risk of blackmail. Lord O’Donnell said:288

“I think some people have different understandings of what DV’ing would reveal. It 
wouldn’t have gone into enormous detail about phone hacking, for example.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: No. It’s concerned with whether you’re likely to be a risk.
A.  Whether  you’re  blackmailable,  basically,  yes,  absolutely,  and  in  terms  of  your 
financial position or your personal life.”

3.64  Upon his appointment as Director of Government Communications, Mr Coulson was required 
to declare any conflicts of interest. He still owned some shares in News Corp at that time. Their 
gross value by the time he gave evidence was around £40,000.289 Lord O’Donnell confirmed

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Ithat these should have been declared but were not.290 Mr Coulson, realistically, did not seek 
to excuse his failure to do so. He first raised the point in his witness statement:291

“Whilst  I  didn’t  consider  my  holding  of  this  stock to  represent  any  kind  of  conflict 
of interest, in retrospect I wish I had paid more attention to it. I was never asked 
about any share or stock holdings and because I knew that I wasn’t involved in any 
commercial issues, including the BskyB bid, it never occurred to me that there could 
be a conflict of interest”.

Later, he said in evidence:292

“This is by way of explanation, not excuse. My job in opposition was a busy one. My 
job in government was busier still, and I didn’t take the time to pay close attention to 
my own circumstances in this regard, and I should have done.”

3.65  Significantly  for  the  purposes  of  the  Inquiry,  Mr  Coulson  did  not  discuss  the  existence  of 
his shareholding in News Corp with anybody in the Conservative Party or in the Coalition 
Government. There is no evidence that anyone else knew about it therefore, or ought to have 
asked about it.293

3.66  Questions as to the wisdom of the appointment of Mr Coulson did not go away. When the 
New  York  Times  published  the  article  of  1  September  2010  which,  amongst  other  things, 
directly  accused  Mr  Coulson  of  encouraging  or  knowledge  of  phone  hacking,  Mr  Coulson 
issued an immediate denial.294 Mr Cameron was made aware of the article but was prepared 
to rely on Mr Cameron’s denial:295

“I don’t recall exactly the conversations that took place. It was on the day I moved 
into Number 10 Downing Street after the birth of our daughter, so that’s the memory 
I have from that day rather than anything around this, but I’m absolutely clear he 
made an outright denial and that was that”.

3.67 

In the same month DAC John Yates reacted by offering to brief the Prime Minister on the 
response of the Metropolitan Police Service to the article in the New York Times. The offer 
was declined by Mr Llewellyn who made the Prime Minister aware of the approach.296 Mr 
Cameron explained why Mr Llewellyn was right to decline the briefing, a decision which he 
said DAC Yates has since accepted was proper and understandable:297

“Q.  But so we understand it, why was it not appropriate?
A.  Well, I think because there was the potential of an investigation following this 
allegation in the New York Times article, I think in terms of just the perception that

I think that would be inappropriate.
I’m  sure  the  Metropolitan  Police  wouldn’t  have  done  anything  inappropriate,  but 
it  would  have  given  the  appearance  of  at  least  being  inappropriate,  and  so  Ed 
Llewellyn declined the request. John Yates said, and I think the words are that that 
was  understandable  and  sensible,  I  think  he  said,  and  Gus  O’Donnell,  the  Cabinet 
Secretary, looked into this and he’s judged that Ed Llewellyn responded absolutely 
correctly to this.
Q.  Did you have any further conversations with Mr Coulson before his –
A.  I think, sorry, John Yates said:
The offer was properly and understandably rejected.”
These  are  the  words  that  he  used.  So  I  think  he  understood  that  while  it  can  be 
appropriate to brief ministers on operational issues, it wouldn’t have been on this 
occasion. Sorry.”

3.68  On 24 February 2010, before the election, the Guardian published an article alleging that, 
while Mr Coulson was the editor, the NoTW had “employed a freelance private investigator 
even though he had been accused of corrupting police officers and had just been released 
from a seven-year prison sentence for blackmail”.298 Although the article did not name the 
investigator concerned, for legal reasons, it was a reference to Jonathan Rees who was then 
the  subject  of  further  criminal  proceedings.  Ian  Katz  discussed  the  issue  first  with  Steve 
Hilton in February 2010 and then with Mr Llewellyn in October 2010. The information was 
not passed to Mr Cameron. He explained why to the House of Commons on 13 July 2011, 
evidence which he repeated to the Inquiry:299

“First, this information was not passed on to me, but let me be clear that this was not 
some secret stash of information; almost all of it was published in The Guardian in 
February 2010, at the same time my office was approached.
It contained no allegations directly linking Andy Coulson to illegal behaviour and it 
did not shed any further light on the issue of phone hacking, so it was not drawn to 
my attention by my office”.

3.69  The editor of the Guardian did not raise the issue with Mr Cameron at meetings both in the 
month after the article was published and the following year.300 Mr Cameron first became 
aware that Jonathan Rees had been employed by the NoTW on Mr Coulson’s watch when the 
Guardian published a further more explicit story on 12 March 2011, seven weeks after Mr 
Coulson’s resignation.301 In those circumstances there can be no criticism of Mr Cameron for 
not raising the issue with Mr Coulson or taking action arising from it.

3.70  Matters eventually got to a point where, on 21 January 2011, Mr Coulson resigned. From his 

perspective, Mr Cameron described what happened:302

1227

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I“I had a number of conversations with him about his impending resignation and what 
followed from the New York Times article, which I know you’ve looked at, is the police 
then had an initial look to see if they should investigate again and said they shouldn’t, 
then they had another look and again concluded that they shouldn’t, and then the 
Crown Prosecution Service on 10 December said they weren’t going to take it any 
further. So again, these weren’t just assurances accepted by me, as it were, there 
were others that took this view.
Then, really, this was the start of the process whereby Andy Coulson was becoming 
clear that, as he put it, when the spokesman needs a spokesman, it’s time to move 
on. He was finding his job was impossible to do because of all these stories and the 
rest of it, and obviously I had a number of discussions with him about his departure.”

3.71  During the eight months in which Mr Coulson was the Director of Government Communications, 
he had very regular contact with the Prime Minister. His evidence gave a good insight into 
Mr  Cameron’s  media  operation.  There  were  usually  two  meetings  each  day  at  which  he 
would see the Prime Minister, one in the morning between 08:30 and 09:00hrs and the other 
in the afternoon at 16:00hrs. Mr Coulson provided a brief media summary as part of the 
morning meeting. The afternoon meeting involved an update and a look ahead. Mr Coulson 
corroborated the Prime Minister’s evidence that Mr Cameron made a conscious decision to 
reduce his personal contact with the media after becoming Prime Minister so that he could 
concentrate on Government. Cabinet Ministers, Mr Coulson stated, were encouraged to do 
more. He described the approach as follows:303

“One  of  the  biggest  changes  of  approach  from  opposition  to  government  with 
regard to communication and the media was the decision to reduce the amount of 
appearances by the PM. Cabinet members were encouraged to do more. We felt that 
Gordon Brown’s habit of providing an almost constant commentary of interviews was 
the wrong approach and that David Cameron would aim to be less obsessed by day to 
day media demands. This had the benefit of creating more time for the real work of 
Government. It also created the impression and more important a reality, of a calmer, 
more professional Government.
This was demonstrated by the fact that on arrival in No10, David Cameron also opted 
to  swap  Gordon  Brown’s  private  office,  which  resembled  a  newspaper  newsroom 
complete with giant plasma screens showing 24 hour news channels, for the smaller 
office next to the Cabinet Room”.

3.72 

In Government Mr Coulson continued his policy of meeting media proprietors, executives and 
seeking to cultivate and maintain a wide and deep range of contacts. This included contact 
with former News International colleagues, both formal and informal in nature. He stayed at 
Dorneywood with Mr and Mrs Osborne, and with Mr and Mrs Brooks, in 2010. Having worked 
together, Mr Coulson and Mr Osborne had become friends.304 Mr Coulson later spent the 
night at the Brooks’ with his family on 31 December 2010 to see in the New Year. 305 He moved

1228

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIin  a  similar  circle  of  politicians  and  media  executives  as  Mr  Cameron  although  he  denied 
advising Mr Cameron to get as close as he could to Mrs Brooks.306

3.73  Mr  Coulson’s  role  on  the  first  occasion  that  Rupert  Murdoch  met  Mr  Cameron  after  the 
election has already been described but he was also at the second, in New York; a dinner 
for the Prime Minister hosted by the Mayor of New York. He also met with Les Hinton and a 
number of News International editors as well as a wide range of other media contacts.307

3.74  Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne were unanimous that whilst working for the Conservative Party 
and later for the Coalition Government, Mr Coulson had discharged his duties professionally.308 
Mr Cameron said of Mr Coulson’s performance:309

“I just make one other point, which is – because I recognise this is a controversial 
appointment, this has come back to haunt both him and me and I’ve said what I’ve 
said about 20/20 hindsight, but in doing the job as Director of Communications for 
the Conservative Party, and then Director of Communications in Downing Street, he 
did the job very effectively. There weren’t any complaints about how he conducted 
himself. He ran a very effective team. He behaved in a very proper way.
Of course, if that wasn’t the case, then I think people would have an even stronger 
argument of saying, “Well, you took a risk, you employed this person and look what’s 
happened.” He did his job very well, and I think that is an important point to make.”

3.75  Mr Osborne, like Mr Cameron, has expressed regret at the appointment with hindsight. He 

stated:310

“I said on 25th July 2011 that “knowing what we know now, we regret the decision 
and  I  suspect  that  Andy  Coulson  would  not  have  taken  the  job  knowing  what  he 
knows  now.  But  we  did  not  have  20/20  hindsight  when  we  made  that  decision.” 
I  hold  this  view  because  of  the  evidence  that  has  since  come  to  light  about  what 
happened  at  the  News  of  the  World  that  had  not  been  uncovered  by  the  original 
police investigation. I did not speak to Mr Coulson before making this statement, or 
since, so I was surmising what his view might be.”

The decision to hold a public inquiry

3.76  2011  brought  no  abatement  in  concern  about  phone  hacking.  On  26  January  2011  the 
Metropolitan  Police  Service  launched  Operation  Weeting,  following  the  provision  of 
significant  new  information  to  them  by  News  International,  which  effectively  reopened 
its inquiries into voicemail interception.311 The first of many arrests in connection with the

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition Iinvestigation occurred in April 2011. The scope of police inquiries widened on 20 June 2011 
when  Operation  Elveden  commenced.312  It  set  out  to  investigate  allegations  that  police 
officers had been receiving payment for confidential information from NoTW reporters.

3.77  The  tide  of  civil  litigation  against  News  Group  News  Ltd  continued  to  rise,  prompting 
significant public admissions and apologies in April 2011 to a number of public figures. Mr 
Miliband first called for an independent inquiry in April 2011.313 On 12 May 2011, in open 
court, NGN admitted liability to wide ranging allegations in the civil proceedings brought by 
Sienna Miller.314

3.78  Matters came to a head in July 2011 when a full blown media storm erupted. It began on 4 
July 2011 with the publication by the Guardian under the Headline: “Missing Milly Dowler’s 
voicemail was hacked by News of World” written by Nick Davies and his colleague Amelia 
Hill.315 News that the NoTW had intercepted Milly Dowler’s voicemail caused immediate and 
profound public outrage. Mr Clegg put it this way:316

“A strong, free, diverse press is the lifeblood of a democratic society. Yet the evidence 
of widespread phone hacking at The News of the World, culminating in the revelation 
that Milly Dowler’s phone had been hacked, led to widespread and justified public 
revulsion. In a very vivid way, illegal newsroom practices were shown to have impacted 
on the lives of ordinary people in the most distressing of circumstances.”

3.79  Events  continued  to  move  quickly  after  that.  On  7  July  2011  James  Murdoch  announced 
the closure of the NoTW which was being abandoned by advertisers. On 8 July 2011, Mr 
Cameron announced that there would be a judge-led inquiry to investigate phone hacking at 
the NoTW and a second inquiry to look at the ethics and culture of the press. He described 
the moment as “carthartic” for both the press and politicians, a term to which he returned in 
his evidence:317

“We’re here because of the truly dreadful things that happened not to politicians but 
to ordinary members of the public whose lives had been turned upside down when 
they’ve  already  suffered  through  losing  their  children,  and  had  their  lives  turned 
upside down in a totally unacceptable way and this is, I think, a cathartic moment 
where press, politicians, police, all the relationships that haven’t been right, we have 
a chance to reset them and that is what we must do.”

3.80  On the same day Mr Coulson, Clive Goodman and one other were arrested. The Guardian 
published  the  fact  that  it  had  discussed  the  NoTW’s  links  with  Jonathan  Rees  with  Mr 
Cameron’s aides. On 9 July 2011, DAC Yates expressed his “extreme regret” at not reopening 
Operation Caryatid. The last edition of the NoTW was published on 10 July 2011. On 11 July 
2011  Mr  Hunt  announced  the  referral  of  the  BSkyB  bid  to  the  Competition  Commission,

315 The article contains an inaccuracy, for which the Guardian has subsequently apologised, in that it is unlikely that the 
News of the World caused the false hope moment described by Mrs Dowler in her evidence. However, the article was 
correct in its assertion that Milly Dowler’s voicemail was intercepted by the News of the World.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIfollowing the withdrawal of the UIL by News Corp.318 The cumulative effect of these events 
aroused  very  great  public  concern.  There  was  also  considerable  concern  about  who  else 
had been the victim of phone hacking and other unethical practices by journalists, or those 
working at their instructions.

3.81  On  13  July  2011  Mr  Cameron,  after  discussions  with  both  Ed  Miliband  and  Nick  Clegg, 
announced this Inquiry to Parliament.319 The terms of reference were agreed with Mr Miliband 
and  Mr  Clegg  and  later  further  discussed  with  the  devolved  administrations  and  others. 
Emphasising the need for a political consensus in response to the scandal, he explained:320

“In my view, it is important that politicians rise to the challenge to do the right thing 
for the country. A free and fearless press is an essential part of our democratic process 
and politicians must act to maintain this wider principle. The opportunity is for this 
Inquiry to produce recommendations that all political parties can get behind and get 
the balance of regulation right. That is why when I set up this Inquiry I agreed the 
Terms of Reference with the leaders of the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties.”

4.	 Reflections
4.1  Mr  Cameron  has  worked  closely  with  the  media  throughout  his  careers  in  politics  and 
television. His experiences of the relationship between the press and the politicians in the 
1990s and early 2000s before becoming Leader of the Opposition were evidently formative. 
Both in Opposition and in Government, his declared strategy has been to engage with a very 
wide range of broadcast and print media and to do so in depth, formally and informally.

4.2 

4.3 

4.4 

He  felt  it  necessary  to  make  considerable  efforts  and  to  allocate  a  good  deal  of  his  time, 
especially in Opposition, to his media strategy. The scale of his disclosed contacts with media 
figures amply demonstrate that this was so. As Prime Minister, he took deliberate steps to 
reduce his personal contact with the media but, at a different level, the approach of maintaining 
wide and deep contacts with the media remained and was continued in Government.

The demands made of politicians both by the 24 hour news cycle and the increasing tendency 
to “high volume” newspaper coverage of events have become greater than ever during Mr 
Cameron’s time at the top level in politics. Those demands are felt in concentrated form by 
directors of communication for political parties and, especially, by the Director of Government 
Communication.

Both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have, with hindsight, expressed regret at their decision 
to appoint Mr Coulson to that post. Mr Coulson’s own assurances played an important part 
in that decision. He continues to stand by them. For obvious reasons concerned with the 
criminal  investigations  and  prosecutions  (both  in  England  and  Scotland),  I  have  not  asked 
any questions directed to the issue of what, if anything, Mr Coulson did know and when or 
whether the assurances that he has given are accurate. These are for another time. None of 
that, however, means that I cannot address the Terms of Reference.

Chapter 4 | The Conservative Revival and the Coalition I4.5 

The  results  of  Mr  Cameron’s  media  strategy  in  Opposition  were  successful  in  winning 
the  support  of  the  centre  right  press  and  the  endorsement  of  News  International.  The 
circumstances  in  which  Rupert  Murdoch  and  his  close  advisers  decided  to  endorse  Mr 
Cameron are complex. Mr Cameron went to great lengths to secure meetings face-to-face 
with Mr Murdoch and other News International executives and editors. The benefits of this 
may have played some part in the outcome but should not be overestimated. As Mr Osborne 
fairly observed, the Conservatives were not the only politicians dining with the Murdochs and 
their executives.321 There were many factors other than personal contact.

4.6 

The  evidence  does  not,  of  course,  establish  anything  resembling  a  ‘deal’  whereby  News 
International’s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours. All of those involved 
strenuously deny that there was a deal whether express or implied. The documents do not 
gainsay them. Nor do the Coalition Government’s actions in Government.

4.7 

Nevertheless, Mr Cameron frankly and, in my view, properly accepts that politicians have got 
too close to the media. In his words:322

“Yes.  I  mean,  that’s  part  of  my  evidence,  really,  is  to  say  I  think  this  relationship 
has been going wrong for, you know – it’s never been perfect. There have always 
been problems and you can point to examples of Churchill putting Beaverbrook as a 
minister. There have been issues for years.
But I think in the last 20 years, I think the relationship has not been right. I think it has 
been too close, as I explain in my evidence, and I think we need to try and get it on a 
better footing.”

4.8 

4.9 

The problem is public perception. This section of the Report has dealt with too many issues 
where the public, not knowing any more than it has (or, I might say, than what it reads in the 
newspapers), has been entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has 
been going on. A way of conducting relationships with the media which leads to a situation in 
which a public Inquiry is needed to take an objective, not to say forensic, look at the matter 
in order to reassure the public cannot be considered as satisfactory or itself in the public 
interest.

Although  it  manifests itself  in  different ways, the problem  is  not  unique  to  any individual 
politician or any one political party. It has affected previous administrations, both in office 
and whilst seeking power. As Mr Cameron has agreed, change is needed, and that means that 
political leaders need to show leadership in making that change. That is also my concluded 
view. I consider in the Conclusions and Recommendations section of this Part of the Report 
what, in my view, would support political leaders in making that change.

MEDIA POLICY: EXAMPLES FROM RECENT 
HISTORY

1.  Purchase of The Times and The Sunday Times

1.1 

1.2 

Introduction
On 22 October 1980 Thomson British Holdings Limited (Thomson) announced its decision 
to  withdraw  from  the  publication  of  The  Times,  The  Sunday  Times  and  their  associated 
publications and to cease publication of all the titles in March 1981 if a buyer could not be 
found by that time.1 It is well known that in the end a buyer was found: Rupert Murdoch’s 
News  International  (NI).  The  acquisition  of  these  iconic  titles  immediately  gave  NI  an 
important place in the national market for broadsheet newspapers. When combined with the 
company’s existing tabloid titles, the News of the World and The Sun, it also conferred upon 
the company a very substantial share of the national newspaper market. The circumstances 
by which NI came to acquire these influential titles has been the subject of controversy ever 
since. This section of the Report examines that transaction for what it may tell us about the 
relationship between the press and politicians of the time.

The decision to sell
It  is  evident  from  the  contemporary  documents  that  Thomson’s  ownership  of  Times 
Newspapers had, by the autumn of 1980, become commercially disastrous. The sale marked 
a decision by Thomson to cut its losses and a conclusion that it had no realistic prospect 
of  reversing  the  position.  At  the  root  of  Thomson’s  problems  was  the  state  of  industrial 
relations. So severe was the problem that publication had been suspended for 11 months in 
1978/79 amidst disputes over procedures, guarantees of continuous production, a new wage 
structure,  manning  levels  and  the  operation  of  new  technology.  Publication  was  resumed 
in November 1979 but many of the agreements reached between management and unions 
soon began to unravel. Industrial disruption in the shape of various forms of non-cooperation 
from sections of the workforce prevented the operation of new technology. In August 1980 
there  was  a  further  strike  by  members  of  the  National  Union  of  Journalists  (NUJ)  which 
prevented publication of The Times and its supplements. During October 1980, The Sunday 
Times was damaged by action in the context of a dispute involving major matters of principle 
between members of the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the National Society of 
Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA). That action alone, which affected production on 
two successive weekends, is estimated to have cost Thomson £500,000 in lost profits. Given 
the continuing industrial unrest, the conclusion recorded at the time by Thomson was that: 
“...there was no possibility of an improvement in industrial relations at Times Newspapers, 
such as to permit the Titles to be produced on an economic basis under Thomson ownership”.2

1.3 

The  draft  management  plan  for  Times  Newspapers  produced  in  September  1980,  but 
considered  by  Thomson  to  be  “very  optimistic”,  forecast  continuing  losses  until  1982  and 

1 The last date set for publication in Thomson ownership of The Sunday Times and the Supplements was 13 
March 1981 and a day later for The Times. p13, Rupert Murdoch, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/

Icash  requirements  totalling  £34.4  million  for  the  years  1980-1982.3  Those  bleak  statistics 
came against the background of very substantial interest free loans made by Thomson to 
Times Newspapers which, by 28 September 1980 totalled £69.8.4 At the time, the company 
described its reasoning in these terms:5

“...the Board of TBH concluded that, in Thomson’s ownership, neither The Times nor 
The Sunday Times was economic as a going concern and that, in the interests not only 
of shareholders but also of the Group’s employees, the present situation, if allowed 
to continue, would threaten the future security and development of the Group as a 
whole.”

1.7 

Setting the deadline
Of some importance to the later political debate was the manner in which it decided to put 
the titles on the market. In particular, and as described later in this section, the March 1981 
deadline for closure of the publications, unless a buyer could be found became fundamental 
to the Secretary of State’s reasoning when he later exercised his discretion to permit NI’s 
acquisition  of  the  titles  without  a  reference  to  the  Monopolies  and  Mergers  Commission 
(MMC).

At the time Thomson asserted that it had to balance a number of factors: (i) its obligations to 
shareholders, as part of a public company, having regard to the scale of Times Newspapers’ 
losses and the demands on the cash resources of the Group; (ii) its desire to see the titles 
survive  in  other  hands;  (iii)  the  legal  requirement  to  give  90  days’  notice  of  potential 
redundancies and begin consultations with the trade unions concerned; and (iv) the legal 
necessity to give certain minimum periods of notice to employees under the terms of their 
employment.6

Thomson recognised that any potential purchaser would have to reach satisfactory manning 
and technology agreements with the unions. Thomson itself had been trying for years, without 
success, to achieve just that. It was convinced that: “The prospect of achieving the agreements 
necessary to make the Titles economic exists only in the context that the alternative is the 
certain cessation of publication and the closure of the Titles”.7 Having adopted the deadline, 
Thomson resolutely stuck to it. It appears to have worked. When writing to the Secretary of 
State on 23 January 1981 the company was able to state that since the announcement of the 
deadline production of the Times Newspapers titles had been efficient and uninterrupted.8

Putting back the deadline would not have been an easy matter. Following the 22 October 1980 
announcement, Thomson gave notice of redundancy proposals both to the Department of 
Employment and to the relevant trade unions allowing for the statutory period of consultation. 
Notices to staff were issued at the end of November. Once issued, these notices could not 
have been withdrawn unilaterally.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIThe bids
Seven proposals, or serious indications of interest, were received by S.G. Warburg & Company 
Limited (Warburgs) before the end of year deadline set by Thomson. They came from:

1.8 

(a)  NI;
(b)  Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL);
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) 
(g) 

Pergamon Press Limited;
Lonrho Limited;
Sea Containers Inc (for The Times only);
A consortium including Journalists of The Times (JOTT) (for The Times only); and
Sir Harold Evans, editor of The Sunday Times, and his associates.

1.9 

A  number  of  other  parties  expressed  but  did  not  follow  up  an  interest  and  two  parties 
expressed an interest in the supplements only.

1.10 

In  evaluating  the  bids  and,  before  that,  when  deciding  with  whom  to  engage  in  serious 
negotiation,  Thomson  applied  a  range  of  non-financial  criteria  which  were  agreed  by  the 
Directors of Times Newspapers Holdings Limited (TNHL). These were:9

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 
(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

the new owner or owners should have (i) editorial credibility; (ii) commercial viability; 
and (iii) managerial skills industrially;
the  new  owners  should  be  seen  to  have  no  direct  religious,  sectional  or  political 
interests;
the new owners should be of good reputation;
the new owners should be asked if they would give a written guarantee of independence 
for the editors on similar lines to that which they have enjoyed under the Astor and 
Thomson ownership; if the appointment of the present editors was to continue then on 
what terms;
the  new  owners  should,  for  preference,  be  British  but  Commonwealth  and  North 
American would not be excluded; and
the  new  owners  should  be  asked  if  they  had  any  views  on  staff  involvement  or 
consultation (this refers to JOTT), and would they agree a form of trust on similar lines 
to the National Directors to act in event of further disposals?

1.11  Other non-financial criteria upon which Thomson stated they placed considerable weight in 

evaluating the proposals of the various parties included:10

(a) 

(b) 
(c) 
(d) 

their ability and determination to conclude complex and difficult negotiations with the 
unions;
the financial and managerial resources required to sustain and develop the titles;
the strength of their commitment to support the individual titles; and
the views of the journalists.

1235

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I1.12  Thomson’s strategy was to negotiate with a single purchaser of all the titles as a continuing 
business  without  interruption  to  production.  It  decided  not  to  pursue  negotiations  with 
other  bidders  unless  a  single  purchaser  and  uninterrupted  production  proved  impossible. 
The reasons given by Thomson for adopting this approach were that the separate acquisition 
of  The  Times  would  require  its  removal  from  the  company’s  Gray’s  Inn  Road  complex,  at 
some considerable cost, cause the loss of 2,000 jobs, almost certainly cease publication for 
a period, and risk industrial unrest which might seriously disrupt production of The Sunday 
Times.11

1.13  Fully understanding that any potential purchaser would only commit to the acquisition subject 
to a satisfactory deal with the unions, Thomson recognised the importance of maximising the 
chances of such an accommodation with the unions. The company decided that this was best 
achieved by ensuring that negotiations with the unions should take place with not more than 
one prospective purchaser of all the titles.12

1.14  The  result  of  this  approach  was  that,  at  the  start  of  1981,  Thomson  entered  into  serious 
negotiations with NI and ANL. Of the others who might have been eligible on these criteria, 
Lonrho did not in the end submit a specific proposal and, for reasons which are not fully 
explained in the contemporary documents, but which appear to relate to the fact that the 
company was owned by Robert Maxwell, Thomson chose not to negotiate with Pergamon 
Press Limited.

1.15 

Internal discussion between Sir Denis Hamilton, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of TNHL, Sir 
Harold Evans (as he now is) and William Rees-Mogg, then editor of The Times, resulted in 
their unanimous agreement that Mr Murdoch was the most suitable future proprietor. Their 
agreement to this effect is recorded in a memorandum to Thomson from Sir Denis, dated 16 
January 1981.13 It is right that I qualify the agreement set out in that document by reference 
to the oral evidence of Sir Harold, who indicated to the Inquiry that in fact his own support for 
Mr Murdoch was, quite naturally, secondary to his preference for his own bid. The explanation 
for the discrepancy between what is recorded in the document and Sir Harold’s oral evidence 
seems to lie in Thomson’s negotiating strategy. Of course Sir Harold preferred his own bid, 
but that was at this stage academic because Thomson was at that time only countenancing 
bids for all of the titles, a restriction which excluded Sir Harold’s bid for The Sunday Times. 
Sir Harold’s preference, amongst those who were bidding for all of the titles, was for NI. The 
memorandum gives eight numbered reasons for preferring Mr Murdoch. First, and perhaps 
foremost  amongst  them,  was  the  assessment  that:  “He  is  a  highly  effective  manager.  He, 
therefore, has the best chance of success on his proven track record. He has built up a big 
business entirely on his own. The company is in a tough spot. It needs a tough operator to 
survive.” It is also interesting to note reason number 5: “He is neither greatly to the Left or 
greatly to the Right in his politics”.14

1.16 

In  preferring  NI’s  bid,  Thomson  was  not  selecting  the  highest  bidder.  ANL  offered  more 
money. However, its bid was thought by Thomson to fall short on other grounds, specifically 
the fact that ANL was not prepared to commit to the continuance of the titles. Thomson also 
took into account the capacity of ANL to carry through the transaction and subsequently to 
manage the titles, and the likely reaction of interested parties, including the journalists, to 
the ownership of the titles by ANL.

1236

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI1.17  Having  emerged  as  Thomson’s  preferred  bidder,  the  next  step  was  for  Mr  Murdoch  to 
appear before the Editorial Vetting Committee of Times Newspapers, consisting of the then 
Chairman of TNHL, three of the four then existing Independent National Directors and both 
of the then editors (Sir Denis Hamilton, Lord Dacre, Lord Greene, Lord Roll, Mr Evans and 
Mr Rees-Mogg). He did so on 21 January 1981. The purpose of the meeting was to evaluate 
would be an acceptable proprietor and at the heart of that process was establishing what 
assurances Mr Murdoch would be prepared to give on matters such as: maintenance of the 
titles, resources for their development; editorial independence and quality; board structures, 
especially continuance of the system of Independent National Directors; and restrictions on 
the acquisition of shares by persons other than the purchaser.15

1.18  The Vetting Committee was sufficiently impressed to recommend Mr Murdoch to the Board 
of TNHL as the preferred bidder. He secured the recommendation by providing a series of 
formal  undertakings.  The  principal  undertakings  were  published  by  TNHL  on  22  January 
1981 in  a press release and  covered the preservation  and  enhancement of the system of 
Independent  National  Directors;  protection  in  relation  to  the  appointment  and  dismissal 
of  editors;  limitation  on  the  disposition  of  titles;  and,  in  some  detail,  the  maintenance  of 
editorial independence.16

The Fair Trading Act 1973

1.19  A valid transfer of The Times and The Sunday Times to NI could not lawfully be executed 
without the written consent of the Secretary of State under s58 of the Fair Trading Act 1973. 
The provision was engaged because the circulation of NI’s titles exceeded the limit stipulated 
in s58(1). In the normal course of events the Secretary of State was prohibited from giving his 
consent until he had received a report on the proposed transfer from the MMC. However, a 
number of exceptions to this rule were provided by the statute including, materially, s58(3)
(a) which provided that:

“Where  the  Secretary  of  State  is  satisfied  that  the  newspaper  concerned  in  the 
transfer is not economic as a going concern and as a separate newspaper then if he is 
also satisfied that, if the newspaper is to continue as a separate newspaper, the case 
is one of urgency, he may give his consent to the transfer without requiring a report 
from the Commission under this section ...”

23 January 1981 – Thomson apply for consent

1.20  By  letter  dated  23  January  1981,  James  Evans,  Joint  Deputy  Managing  Director  of  The 
Thomson Organisation Limited applied to the Secretary of State for Trade, the Rt Hon John 
Biffen MP (as he then was) for written consents for the transfer of The Times and The Sunday 
Times from TNHL to NI.17 A memorandum, enclosed with the letter, explained the factual 
background in support of the application.18

1.21  The basis for contending that the case was one of urgency was the March 1981 deadline 
which Thomson had itself imposed. In addition to citing the original reasons for setting the 
deadline, the memorandum explained that it had resisted requests to extend the deadline 
and considered an extension to be impossible. Thomson steadfastly maintained its reliance

1237

Chapter 5 | Media Policy Iupon its original reasons and cited five further reasons in support of its stance. They were as 
follows:19

(a) trade  union  opinion  at  a  senior  level  is  very  strongly  of  the  view  that  a 
deadline for closure as an alternative to sale is essential if the necessary new 
arrangements are to be made with their members, particularly at chapel level, 
to secure the necessary cost reductions vital to the financial future of the Titles;
(b) since the announcement of October 1980 the staff of Times Newspapers have 
inevitably been under a very considerable strain due to the uncertainties of 
their future and to prolong this period of uncertainty could now easily lead to 
many of the staff seeking other employment thus jeopardising the ability of 
Times Newspapers to continue publication of the Titles;

(c)  in addition, if the March deadline was extended, even for a very limited period, 
it  would  be  necessary  to  withdraw  a  very  large  number  of  notices  already 
issued, particularly those which terminate simultaneously with the deadlines. 
Since notices cannot be withdrawn unilaterally by the employer and must be 
subject to the agreement of the individual employee, it is highly likely that the 
trade unions concerned would seek to exact a heavy price for agreement to the 
withdrawal of notices or any extension of the notice period. Other alternatives 
such as the offer of short-term engagements have been considered but give 
rise to legal consequences involving a cost exposure which it is impossible to 
risk. Even if some employees were willing to cooperate, a position could easily 
emerge in which an insufficient number did so and the company would then 
be faced with a contractual commitment to pay those employees for a further 
period yet be unable to produce the Titles.

(d) in  the  consultations  which  have  already  taken  place  with  the  trade  unions 
since 22 October 1980, there has been great pressure from the trade unions to 
discuss redundancy terms on the basis of closure. The company has declined 
to do so, mainly for the reason that so long as there is a possibility of sale it is 
not only inappropriate to do so but inadvisable. The terms of redundancy on 
closure are likely to be a very contentious issue and discussion of them would 
run a grave risk of causing disruption at a time when continuity of production 
is vital for the prospects of sale. It will be necessary, for legal reasons, to enter 
into  discussions  of  redundancy  terms  on  the  basis  of  closure  within  a  very 
short time. If there is a further period of uncertainty as to whether or not a 
sale can be achieved, this could jeopardise the negotiations now beginning 
for the improvements required as a pre-condition of sale and survival of the 
Titles;

(e) further  uncertainty  could  have  very  adverse  trading  consequences.  While 
readers and advertisers have remained loyal to the Titles not only through the 
period of 11 months’ suspension but also through erratic publication caused 
by industrial disruption, there are now signs that advertisers are becoming 
reluctant to commit ahead in terms of booking space except on a short-term 
basis, and this is a particular problem for The Sunday Times Colour Magazine 
because of its longer “lead” time to publication. In order to secure sufficient 
bookings for issues subsequent to 8 March, the Sunday Times Colour Magazine 
is  now  having  to  offer  substantial  discounts  to  advertisers.  This  has  very 

19 pp10-12, ibid 

1238

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIserious implications in view of the importance of the magazine to the financial 
position of The Sunday Times.”

26 January 1981 – Mr Biffen’s consideration of the application

1.22  Mr Biffen acted with great speed. On 26 January 1981, he met first Thomson and then Mr 
Murdoch,  before  attending  a  meeting  of  the  Cabinet  Ministerial  Committee  on  Economic 
Strategy.20

1.23  The fact that Mr Biffen met Mr Evans, who acted on behalf of Thomson, on the morning of 
26 January 1981, and the substance of their discussions, is evidenced by the letter which the 
latter sent to the former later the same day. Mr Biffen attempted to persuade Thomson to 
extend the deadline and indicated that it would be reasonable to hope for a report from the 
MMC by 25 March 1981. The letter sets out Thomson’s substantive response to that request. 
The company remained immovable on the subject, making essentially the same points as are 
set out in their earlier memorandum of 23 January 1980 (discussed above) but also relying 
upon a condition in their agreement with NI that, if the Secretary of State’s agreement had 
not been obtained by 12 February 1981, then the agreement would not have effect.21

1.24  Mr Biffen’s meeting with Mr Murdoch is evidenced by an office minute prepared by Mr Biffen’s 
officials. It is an important document, not least because it records Mr Biffen as being minded, 
at that time, to refer the transfer to the MMC:22

“1  The Secretary of State said that there was a presumption behind the legislation 
that he had to refer a newspaper merger automatically to the MMC unless particular 
financial and timing considerations applied which allowed him to exercise discretion 
over  whether  the  merger  should  be  referred  or  not.  He  said  that  he  had  still  to 
come to a decision on whether these considerations applied in this instance though 
he admitted that he was prejudiced in favour of a reference in order to defuse any 
criticism of the bid”.

1.25  Mr Murdoch signalled to the Secretary of State his willingness to maintain his bid if Thomson 
extended its self-imposed deadline. Although he was at pains to explain that any such extension 
would create problems both for him and for Thomson. He thought that an extension of about 
two months would be required, on the assumption that the MMC reported favourably by 
25 March 1981, because of the need thereafter to negotiate with the unions.

1.26  Mr Biffen maintained his preference for a referral to the MMC throughout the meeting. He 
does not appear to have ventilated any concerns about plurality. Rather, his concern appears 
to have been to avoid criticism. The final paragraph of the minute states:23

“8  The  Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  in  his  political  judgment  an  MMC 
investigation would be the best means of defusing criticism. He considered that the 
MMC would be able to complete a report in about eight weeks and he hoped that Mr

22 See http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/23_12_10_murdoch_meeting.pdf.
This document is dated 2 February 1981 but, since consent had been given by then, this must be a reference to the 
date upon which the document was produced. The fact that Mr Biffen met Mr Rupert Murdoch on 26 January 1981 is 
evidenced in the minutes of the meeting of the Cabinet Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy.
23 ibid

1239

Chapter 5 | Media Policy IMurdoch would encourage Thomsons to extend their deadlines so as to allow such an 
investigation to take place”.

1.27  Despite his clear preference for an MMC investigation, Mr Biffen did explore the alternative at 
the meeting, expressing the view that there would have to be “...an extremely comprehensive 
set of assurances to allay the fears that had been expressed...”. On that issue, Mr Murdoch 
provided reassurance: “...he was happy to see the assurances that he had given on editorial 
independence given some statutory backing...”

1.28  At  4.45hrs  on  the  same  day,  Mr  Biffen  attended  a  meeting  of  the  Cabinet  Ministerial 
Committee on Economic Strategy, chaired by the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. 
Times Newspapers was one of two items discussed. In the intervening period between his 
meetings with Mr Evans and Mr Murdoch and the meeting of the Cabinet Committee, Mr 
Biffen had received Thomson’s letter declining to extend their self-imposed deadline because 
he was aware of it by the time of the meeting.24

1.29 

It is clear from the minutes that Mr Biffen understood the test which he was required to apply 
under s58(3)(a) Fair Trading Act 1973 and that his Cabinet colleagues correctly understood 
that the decision had to be taken by Mr Biffen and not collectively. Mr Biffen reported that: 
“...On the basis of advice from his Department’s accountants, he was satisfied that neither 
The Times nor The Sunday Times was economic as a going concern, though only in the case 
of The Times was the issue clear-cut. He was also satisfied the case was one of urgency ...”. 
Consequently, discussion was focused on whether Mr Biffen should exercise his discretion to 
consent to the merger without prior reference to the MMC. The minute succinctly records 
how Mr Biffen appears to have regarded the choice before him:25

“...He (the Secretary of State), therefore had two alternatives open to him. He could 
make  a  reference  to  the  MMC  in  the  hope  that  the  Thomson  Organisation  would 
then extend their deadlines, but with the risks of causing TBH to lose a substantial 
sum of money, of declaring around 4,000 redundancies, and of bringing about what 
might prove to be the permanent closure of The Times. Alternatively he could give his 
consent without a reference, subject to a condition which would in effect entrench 
the  undertakings  which  Mr  Murdoch  had  given,  bearing  on  the  independence  of 
the  papers  and  on  editorial  freedom,  and  ensure  that  they  could  not  be  changed 
thereafter without his consent.”

1.30 

In discussion it was thought unlikely that Thomson would refuse to extend their deadline in 
the event of a referral, but that there was little advantage in a reference and considerable risks 
and costs in making it. Thomson had taken the view that no suitable alternative purchaser 
had made a bid. Those who were pressing for a reference were mainly concerned to secure 
greater authority behind the undertakings on independence which had already been given. 
This concern should be met by entrenching the undertakings in the consent. The Opposition, 
it was thought, might be less inclined to press for a reference when they understood the 
potential consequences. It was left to Mr Biffen to make his decision.26

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI27 January 1981 – Mr Biffen’s decision and debate in Parliament

1.31  An Emergency Debate was held in the House of Commons on 27 January 1981 to discuss 
a  reference  of  the  transfer  to  the  MMC.  Contrary  to  the  hopes  expressed  in  Cabinet  the 
previous day, the Opposition pressed vigorously for a reference. The Rt Hon John Smith MP 
pointed first to the concentration of newspaper power which would result from the transfer, 
describing it as: “probably unique and unprecedented in our history”;27 second, to the special 
place of The Times and The Financial Times in national life; and third to the mechanism for 
scrutiny  afforded  under  the  Fair  Trading  Act  1973.  As  to  that  Act,  he  contended  that  The 
Sunday Times was economic as a going concern. The undertakings given by Mr Murdoch, he 
argued, removed rather than strengthened existing safeguards.

1.32  The financial issue was contested by Mr Biffen, who insisted that he had to look at the issue 
under the existing ownership and under present conditions. He was supported in his approach 
by the Rt Hon Peter Emery MP, who had been the Minister responsible for getting the Act 
onto the statute book.28 Mr Biffen also made clear his view that there was a real possibility 
of closure if he chose to refer the matter to the MMC, pointing out that he had no power to 
compel the MMC to produce a report to an abridged timetable. He concluded:29

“After  earnest  consideration,  and  to  avoid  disruption  and  uncertainty,  I  have 
concluded that I should give my consent forthwith, and without a Monopolies and 
Mergers  Commission  investigation,  to  the  transfer  of  Times  Newspapers  to  News 
International, subject to certain conditions.”

1.33  The  eight  conditions  referred  to  were  firmly  entrenched.  Those  relating  to  editorial 
independence were incorporated into the articles of association of the relevant companies. 
Any  change  to  them  required  the  Secretary  of  State’s  consent.  All  of  the  conditions,  if 
breached,  were  potentially  the  subject  of  criminal  proceedings  and  a  custodial  sentence. 
Sections 62(2) and 62(3) of the Fair Trading Act 1973 provided:30

“(2)  Where ...the consent of the Secretary of State is given to a transfer of a newspaper 
or of newspaper assets, but is given subject to one or more conditions, any person 
who is knowingly concerned in, or privy to, a breach of that condition, or of any of 
those conditions, as the case may be shall be guilty of an offence”.
“(3)  A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable, on conviction on 
indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine or to 
both”.

1.34  George Gardiner MP described the conditions in the debate as being: “...as stringent as any that 
could conceivably arise from an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission”.31 
At  the  end  of  the  debate,  Mr  Biffen  quoted  Sir  Harold  Evans  who  had  said  earlier  in  the 
day that: “No Editor or Journalist could ask for wider guarantees of editorial independence 
on news and policy than those Mr Murdoch has accepted and which are not entrenched by 
the Secretary of State”.32 It is right, of course, to point out, as Sir Harold did when he gave

to that of NI.33

1.35  The debate did not split strictly down party lines. Jonathan Aitken MP (Conservative), who, 
as the great-nephew of Lord Beaverbrook, had family connections with a newspaper empire 
spoke against the transfer, warning:34

“The  plain  fact  is  that  Mr  Murdoch  has  strewn  assurances  and  safeguards  on 
newspaper and television ownership like confetti, all round the world, and the more 
one examines those assurances the more one has to say that in far too many instances 
they have proved to be worthless.”

1.36  Mr Aitken was one of a number of MPs who criticised Thomson’s self-imposed deadline and 

believed that there were other credible bidders. He put it graphically:35

“Lord  Thomson  and  Mr  Murdoch  are  putting  a  phoney  pistol  to  the  head  of  the 
Secretary  of  State  and  saying  to  him,  in  effect,  “Stand  and  deliver  without  your 
reference  to  the  commission.”  I  believe  he  should  have  called  their  bluff,  because 
there were plenty of other serious alternative bidders in the ring”.

1.37  From the other side of the political fence, Ron Leighton MP (Labour), who was a sponsored 
member of the printing union NATSOPA, made clear the support of the trade unions for the 
NI bid:36

“The  printing  trade  unions  and,  I  understand,  a  very  large  number  of  journalists 
take the view that the best chance of keeping the publications in existence is Rupert 
Murdoch – not Atlantic Richfield or Associated Newspapers ...it is our view that the 
most viable offer is the one from Murdoch”.

1.38  Two MPs alleged at the time that the decision was, in reality, that of the then Prime Minister. 

Firstly, Phillip Whitehead MP opined:37

“I detect the opinions of the Prime Minister. I think that it is the Prime Minister who 
has dictated that Rupert is owed a favour and that the proposal should not go to 
the commission. The Minister is an honourable man and a man somewhat given to 
private and public agonising.”

Mr Biffen rejected that suggestion.

1.39  Second,  the  Rt  Hon  Geoffrey  Robinson  MP  said:  “In  this  his  first  major  decision  the  right 
hon.  Gentleman  has  failed  to  stand  up  to  the  Prime  Minister.  That  is  the  reality...This  is  a 
straightforward pay-off for services rendered by The Sun.”38

1.40 

In the result, the motion was defeated by 281 votes to 239 and the transfer took place without 
a reference to the MMC.

1.41  The debate was followed by a brief correspondence between Mr Smith and Mr Biffen, about 
the figures upon which the Secretary of State had relied. By letter dated 3 February 1981,

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIMr Biffen conceded that he had made an error in the House but, for reasons which were 
explained in the letter, stood by the overall conclusion that neither The Times nor The Sunday 
Times was economic.39

The decision not to commence judicial review proceedings

1.42  The reaction of journalists at The Sunday Times was such that initially a legal challenge by way 
of judicial review of Mr Biffen’s decision seemed likely. In the result support for such action 
collapsed. Sir Harold Evans explained that this change of heart was the result of concern that, 
if a claim had been successfully brought, and a reference to the MMC ordered, The Times 
might have been lost.40

The continuing controversy

1.43  Allegations that the Minister might have taken into account irrelevant political considerations 
were not only raised in Parliament but repeated outside. In his diary entry for 14 June 1987, 
Lord Wyatt states that he told Mr Murdoch that:41

“I reminded Rupert during the evening how at his request and at my instigation she 
had  stopped  the  Times  acquisition  being  referred  to  the  Monopolies  Commission 
though the Sunday Times was not really losing money and the pair together were 
not.“

1.44  The entry for 1 December 1995 recites a conversation with Dr Irwin and Cita Stelzer, recording 

that he (Wyatt) had said:42

“I had all the rules bent for him over The Sunday Times and The Times when he bought 
them. Because of the strikes the Sunday Times was at that time losing a bomb, and 
so was the Times. Through Margaret I got it arranged that the deal didn’t go to the 
Monopolies Commission which almost certainly would have blocked it.”

1.45  Sir  Harold  Evans  was  explicit  in  his  suggestion  to  the  Inquiry  that  there  had  in  fact  been 
something of a transaction in this matter between Baroness Thatcher and Mr Murdoch.43 He 
also said that he was told that Baroness Thatcher had determined the titles must go to Mr 
Murdoch because she valued his support:44

“I was told by someone I know that Mrs Thatcher had determined it must go to Mr 
Murdoch because she valued his support. In this belief, I was supportive of Mr Hugh 
Stephenson at The Times, who had it from a friend in the Cabinet Office that Mrs 
Thatcher’s real debt of gratitude was the crucial factor in doing it. Lord Donoughue, 
Bernard Donoughue, had it from the Cabinet Office that she owed him a debt. He had 
supported her in the last election, and would support him in the next. Mr Jim Prior

Chapter 5 | Media Policy Iin an interview with Mr Bruce Page said of course it was a purely cynical ploy for 
political support.”

Lunch at Chequers

1.46  More than 30 years after the events in question, in March 2012, and not long before Mr 
Murdoch  gave  evidence  to  the  Inquiry,  previously  unpublished  documents  were  released 
by  the  Churchill  Archives  Centre.  These  revealed  that  Mr  Murdoch  had  visited  Chequers 
for lunch with Baroness Thatcher on Sunday 4 January 1981. This was a surprise because 
Mr Murdoch had not told the author of The History of the Times, Graham Stewart, about it 
when interviewed in 1995. Sight of the documents, which he did not dispute, did not rekindle 
any recollection.45 In the light of that, and of the allegations of influence made in 1981 and 
thereafter, these documents call for careful scrutiny.

1.47  Events are primarily recorded in a four page note for the record produced by Sir Bernard 
Ingham (as he became) the day afterwards.46 The lunch was attended by Baroness and Sir 
Denis Thatcher, Sir Bernard and Mr Murdoch. It was at Mr Murdoch’s request. There was 
discussion of President Reagan’s then embryonic administration and of Australian politics. 
The main purpose of Mr Murdoch’s visit though was “...to brief the Prime Minister on his bid 
for Times Newspapers”. The deadline for bids had expired during the course of the previous 
week. The note records in outline the bid which Mr Murdoch’s NI had made and his plans for 
turning the business around are set out in some detail. Mr Murdoch pointed out the scale 
of the financial risk that he was taking and the difficult economic climate in which he would 
have to operate. He also speculated about the other bids which he thought had been made 
(Sir Bernard had tried but failed to establish through the Department of Trade information 
about the bids).

1.48  The impression given by the note is that Mr Murdoch did most of the talking. Sir Bernard was 
careful to record the passive role played by Baroness Thatcher in the last paragraph of the 
document:47

“The Prime Minister thanked Mr. Murdoch for keeping her posted on his operations. 
She did no more than wish him well in his bid, noting the need for much improved 
arrangements in Fleet Street affecting manning and the introduction of new technology. 
Mr Murdoch made it clear that in his view the prime need, given the inevitability of 
progressing  gradually,  was  to  apply  existing  technology  with  reasonable  manning 
levels.”

1.49  The note was marked Commercial – In Confidence and Baroness Thatcher required that it did 
not go outside No.10.48 Mr Murdoch sent a handwritten thank you letter, on 15 January 1981, 
reporting in relation to the sale that the field had narrowed down to two or three.49

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIReflections

1.50  There appears to be little reason to doubt the difficulty of the situation faced by Thomson 
in the autumn of 1980. Electing to cut their losses was a commercial decision in the face of 
mounting losses and real industrial relations problems. The reasons which they recorded at 
the time explain why it was important for them to set a deadline. Other aspects of Thomson’s 
behaviour fall well within the range of reasonable responses for an organisation in its position. 
Looked at from the company’s point of view, Thomson’s preference for a single bidder with 
the means to purchase the whole of Times Newspapers is understandable. The successful sale 
of either title individually could have jeopardised the fortunes of the other. Their choice of Mr 
Murdoch as preferred bidder, later endorsed by the Times Vetting Committee, is explicable 
on the merits of his bid. ANL, the other serious contender for a purchase of both titles, would 
not commit to maintaining them both. Mr Murdoch was thought to be a man capable of 
negotiating successfully with the trade unions. Indeed, he was the preferred choice of the 
trade unions. Most significantly for the purposes of this Report, there is no evidence that any 
political pressure was put upon Thomson to prefer NI’s bid.

1.51  However, that there was a confidential meeting between the then Prime Minister and Mr 
Murdoch, the fact of which did not emerge into the public domain for more than 30 years, is 
troubling in its lack of transparency. It serves as a reminder of the importance of contemporary 
practice to make public the fact of such meetings. The perceptions at the time and since of 
collusive arrangements between the Prime Minister and the preferred bidder are corrosive 
of public confidence.

1.52  Not surprisingly, the contemporary documents do not evidence any form of express ‘deal’ 
between Mr Murdoch and anyone in the Government of the day, including the Prime Minister. 
The note of the meeting itself is careful to record that Baroness Thatcher did no more than 
wish  Mr  Murdoch  well.  The  minutes  of  the  Cabinet  Ministerial  Committee  on  Economic 
Strategy demonstrate that the committee was well aware that the decision was ultimately 
for Mr Biffen alone. They are corroborated by Mr Biffen’s contemporaneous denial that he 
took irrelevant considerations into account.

1.53  Why then did Mr Murdoch seek an invitation to Chequers? The prospective deal was plainly 
of great importance to him. He no doubt believed that there was real value in meeting the 
Prime Minister face-to-face, to inform her of his bid and his plans in the event that it was 
successful, and importantly, to form a personal connection. He would have expected to make 
a good impression on Baroness Thatcher; he would have known of her respect for risk taking 
entrepreneurs, and that they would have thought alike on the merits of turning around a 
troubled newspaper company with industrial relations problems. Their world views had much 
in common.50 There is no evidence that the approach made any difference to the outcome 
of events; nevertheless, Mr Murdoch was no doubt making an investment, not least in the 
context of the union confrontation which both would have seen in the future.

1.54 

I have carefully considered what conclusions (whether as to fact or credibility), if any, I should 
draw  from  Mr  Murdoch’s  inability  to  recall  the  meeting  either  when  interviewed  for  the 
History of The Times or when he appeared before the Inquiry. It is perhaps a little surprising 
that he does not remember a visit to a place as memorable as Chequers, in the context of a 
bid as important as that which he made for Times Newspapers. However, perhaps that is all 
I need to say.

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I2.	 Response	to	the	reports	of	Sir	David	Calcutt	QC

2.1 

2.2

2.4 

2.5 

Introduction
The Report has already considered the background to, and conclusions of, the Calcutt Reviews 
in some detail.51 This section of the Report does not seek to repeat any of that detail but to 
examine the political response to the Calcutt Reviews.

The first Calcutt Report

Sir David Calcutt QC published his first report on Privacy and Related Matters in June 1990. It 
was highly critical of the existing Press Council and set out in clear terms the failings of that 
organisation. It recommended that the Press Council be abolished and replaced with a new 
self-regulatory  organisation,  the  Press  Complaints  Commission.  The  report  recommended 
that this new organisation should deal with the numerous and substantial concerns that had 
been raised around the behaviour of some parts of the press.

The report recommended that the new PCC be given 18 months to demonstrate that self-
regulation could work effectively. Sir David recommended that, if this challenge could not be 
met, then an independent complaints-handling tribunal should be set up (which would have 
required legislation). The details of the recommendations are set out elsewhere.52

The response of the industry was swift but selective. The Press Council was disbanded, and the 
Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF) was created for the purpose of funding the PCC. 
The PCC itself was incorporated on 1 January 1991. However, many of the recommendations 
made in the first Calcutt report were not implemented by the PCC. For instance, the Code of 
Conduct was promulgated by the industry rather than the PCC itself, and the appointments to 
the PCC were made by the new Chairman, rather than by way of an independent appointments 
process.

The second Calcutt Report

Concern about the conduct of the press continued and was not dispelled by the PCC. The final 
straw appears to have been the publication in The Sun of the detail of intimate conversations 
between the Princess of Wales and James Gilbey, and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess 
of Cornwall (as she now is). On 9 July 1992, Sir David was asked by the Rt Hon David Mellor 
QC MP, Secretary of State for National Heritage, to conduct a second review and he did so, 
reporting in January 1993.

2.6 

In summary, Sir David’s second report made clear his view that the press was neither able nor 
willing to initiate reforms that might constitute a credible form of self-regulation in which the 
public could have confidence. He put it in this way:53

“The Press Complaints Commission is not, in my view, an effective regulator of the 
press. It has not been set up in a way, and is not operating a code of practice, which 
enables it to command not only press but also public confidence. It does not, in my 
view, hold the balance fairly between the press and the individual. It is not the truly 
independent body which it should be.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.7 

He therefore recommended that the proposals set out in his first report for a Press Complaints 
Tribunal be enacted as soon as possible. The detail of his recommendations is set out more 
fully above,54 but can be summarised as having three main ‘strands’ as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

the  PCC  should  be  disbanded  and  replaced  by  an  independent  Press  Complaints 
Tribunal;
the introduction of new criminal offences, making it a criminal offence to enter property 
with a view to obtaining personal information without consent, to place surveillance 
devices on private property without consent, or to photograph or record someone on 
private property without consent. Various defences were proposed; and
consideration of a new tort of privacy.

2.8 

Both the PCC and the industry opposed Sir David’s analysis. The PCC suggested an alternative; 
namely amendments to the Code of Practice, new guidance for journalists and some changes 
to the way in which the PCC was run and governed.

2.9 

The Political Response: David Mellor
In December 1989, some six months before Sir David’s first report, Mr Mellor was a Home 
Office Minister of State, working to David Waddington MP, who was then Home Secretary. At 
that time, prior to the creation of the Department of National Heritage following the 1992 
election,  the  Home  Office  was  responsible  for  media  policy.  Mr  Mellor  gave  a  television 
interview in that month indicating that, in the light of Sir David’s forthcoming report, the 
press were now drinking in the ‘last chance saloon’. These were words the press were never 
to forget.

2.10  Mr Mellor became Secretary of State for National Heritage on 11 April 1992, just over a year 
after the PCC had been created. Shortly after commissioning Sir David Calcutt’s review, in 
July 1992, Mr Mellor was the subject of a “kiss and tell” story, in which the actress Antonia 
de Sancha sold her story of his extra-marital affair with her. Conversations between Ms De 
Sancha and Mr Mellor had been recorded and were then published in The Sun. Although 
Mr  Mellor  survived  in  office,  the  press  pursued  details  of  his  private  life  and  published  a 
number of further stories about him, including one which alleged that he had enjoyed two 
free  holidays;  one  as  the  guest  of  the  daughter  of  an  official  of  the  Palestine  Liberation 
Organisation and one as the guest of the ruler of Abu Dhabi. Finally, after weeks of personal 
and negative coverage, Mr Mellor resigned on 24 September 1992.

2.11  Mr Mellor felt at the time that he had been hounded out of office by the press as a result of 
his comments and his formal request to Sir David to conduct a second review; asked by the 
Inquiry whether he believed that the timing of the adverse articles was deliberate, however, 
he said this: 55

“No, I think it was coincidental, because interestingly, the News of the World had the 
first chance at the de Sancha story and elected not to publish it, so... I think it was just, 
you know, an inconvenient moment for one’s private life to fall out of the cupboard.”

Afternoon-Hearing-26-June-2012.pdf

1247

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I2.12  However, he did claim that coverage of the the ‘kiss and tell’ story had been personal and 

disproportionate, and that the press did appear to be pursuing a personal attack: 56

“What shouldn’t happen, though, is it then becomes a sort of vendetta and people 
then  go  around  thinking  because  you  are  a  wounded  animal,  rather  like  in  those 
nature films, you know, the beast can sort of rip you to bits without any worry about 
fairness, truth or anything and you know, we come to the wretched Chelsea shirt. You 
know ... fan that I am of Chelsea Football Club, I have never owned a Chelsea shirt. 
Never felt the need to – and that was a total invention.... Insofar as my rather sad and 
pathetic little Chelsea shirt incident has any relevance... it shows a press that was out 
of control and had no concern with the truth whatsoever, no concern with the public 
interest. They were just having a laugh and I was stupid enough to put myself in a 
position where they could laugh at me, fool that I was”.

2.13  Although Mr Mellor took the view that the timing of the articles, shortly after he announced 
the second Calcutt Review, was coincidental, there is no doubt that there was a measure 
of press triumphalism at his resignation. The day after his resignation, The Sun’s front page 
contained the headline “From Toe Job to No Job”57 and Bill Hagerty, then Editor of The People, 
commented: “This is the first time in ages that David Mellor has done the right thing”. 58

Lord Brooke

2.14  Mr Mellor was replaced as Secretary of State for National Heritage by the Rt Hon Peter Brooke 
MP,  now  Lord  Brooke.  Lord  Brooke  was  Secretary  of  State  for  National  Heritage  between 
September 1992 and July 1994. As such, he was Secretary of State for the period immediately 
following the publication of Sir David’s second report and the first of two Secretaries of State 
with responsibility for responding to that report. He described this role in this way:59

“I should stress that my involvement in that response [the government’s response to 
Sir David’s second report] was my principal media responsibility during my 22 months 
as Secretary of State”.

2.15 

It is important to note from the outset that although Sir David’s second report was published 
in  January  1993,  the  Government’s  response  to  it  did  not  emerge  until  1995,  after  Lord 
Brooke’s time as Secretary of State. He explained:60

“the chronological narrative indicates how not once but twice we ran out of time to 
settle the genuine departmental differences between us”.

He concluded:61

“only historians can fully determine how, where or why we failed, which of course I 
regard as an embarrassment”.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIThe  Inquiry  was  interested  in  understanding  how  and  why  there  was  no  consensus,  why 
the process took so long, and why so little was ultimately done. In order to answer these 
questions, it is necessary to consider the chronological narrative in a little detail.

2.16  Upon publication of the second report in January 1993, Lord Brooke made an oral statement 
to the House of Commons. Having made clear that a final response would have to await the 
report  of  the  Select  Committee on  National  Heritage on  Privacy and  Media  Intrusion  and 
the outcome of the debate on Mr Soley’s Bill,62 Lord Brooke indicated that the Government 
was broadly supportive of Sir David’s recommendations relating to privacy, such as the case 
for new criminal offences to deal with specified types of physical intrusion, and that further 
consideration should be given to the introduction of a new tort of infringement of privacy as 
recommended. However, on the central recommendation that a Press Complaints Tribunal 
be set up, he put the Government’s position this way: 63

“I turn now to Sir David’s recommendation that the Government should introduce a 
statutory regime for dealing with complaints against the press. That raises separate, 
and more difficult, issues which need to be carefully weighed. The Government agree 
with Sir David that the Press Complaints Commission, as at present constituted, is not 
an effective regulator of the press. It is not truly independent and its procedures are 
deficient. Sir David’s detailed analysis of those shortcomings is compelling. We also 
recognise the strength of the case that he makes in his report for a statutory tribunal 
with wide-ranging powers. At the same time, we are conscious that action to make 
such a body statutory would be a step of some constitutional significance, departing 
from the traditional approach to press regulation in this country. In the light of those 
considerations, the Government would be extremely reluctant to pursue that route. A 
most persuasive case for statutory regulation would need to be made out.”

2.17  That was also the view of the press. The report of the Select Committee on National Heritage 
was published on 24 March 1993.64 In summary, it recommended a new Protection of Privacy 
Bill, but rejected the recommendation for a press complaints tribunal concluding that “unless 
future events show such a tribunal to be utterly unavoidable”,65 it was preferable to rely on 
self-regulation.

Strand 1: The Press Complaints Tribunal

2.18 

In rejecting the proposal of a tribunal, the Select Committee did propose the appointment 
of a Press Ombudsman (which would also have required legislation), on the basis that “a 
regulatory level is needed beyond that of the Press Commission”. The Ombudsman, it was 
envisaged,  would  be  able  to  provide  an  ‘accessible  and  effective  recourse’  for  ‘anyone 
dissatisfied with the outcome of a Press Commission investigation, or whose complaint had 
been rejected without an investigation.’66 Lord Wakeham (then the Chairman of the Cabinet 
Committee  on  Home  and  Social  Affairs)  opposed  this  proposal,  describing  it  as  “Calcutt’s 
statutory tribunal by another name”.67

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I2.19  On 28 June 1993, Lord Brooke minuted Lord Wakeham saying that the White Paper would 
acknowledge  the  steps  already  taken  to  meet  some  of  the  Calcutt  and  Select  Committee 
criticisms, but that the Government preferred to retain self-regulation. It was clear therefore 
from that date that the Government had decided to reject the proposals for a either a Press 
Complaints Tribunal, or a Press Ombudsman.

2.20  On 29 July 1993 the Lord Chancellor’s Department, in conjunction with the Scottish Office, 
published  a  consultation  paper.  This  floated  the  idea  of  a  voluntary  press  Ombudsman 
scheme being set up within the PCC itself. In September 1993, Lord Brooke gave a speech to 
the Conservative Party conference, referring to the concept of a ‘voluntary Ombudsman’. In 
November 1993, he gave a speech to the Institute of Public Relations, calling on the press to 
establish such a voluntary Press Ombudsman. Again, as will be seen, this was never something 
taken up by either the press or by Government.

Strand 2: criminal offences

2.21  On 14 January 1993, Lord Brooke made a statement to the House of Commons in which he 

said this about the new proposed criminal offences: 68

“The Government accepts the case for new criminal offences to deal with specified 
types of physical intrusion and covert surveillance ... Subject to further examination of 
the details of the proposed offences ... The Government will bring forward legislation 
in due course”.

2.22  By May 1993, the Cabinet had agreed that the Criminal Justice Bill, to be introduced either 
that year or the following year, should include provisions on intrusion. Indeed, Lord Brooke 
told the Inquiry that, before a Cabinet meeting in June 1993, Sir John Major had expressed 
interest in seeing details of proposed criminal offences. At that meeting, the new proposed 
criminal offences were discussed. Lord Brooke told the Inquiry: 69

“Criminal offences had been discussed on June 24th in terms of Parliamentary handling. 
I sought to reach agreement with the Home Secretary and that the offences should 
apply to those who profited from, or even used without profit, the results of illegal 
intrusion. The intrusion and the use of the material should thus be separate offences. 
The offences should only apply to personal information but the offences should be in 
the 1993-4 session of legislation, having been accepted as far back as 1990”.

2.23  On 18 August 1993, a Cabinet Office note on possible criminal offences on intrusion concluded 
by noting that the aim remained to publish a White Paper in September of that year, following 
a discussion at the first meeting of Cabinet after the summer break. However, the ambition of 
publishing the White Paper in September was not fulfilled.

2.24 

In January 1994, Lord Wakeham met with the Lord Chancellor (Lord MacKay), Lord Brooke, 
the  Home  Secretary  and  a  number  of  other  senior  politicians,  to  discuss  the  Calcutt 
recommendations.  Lord  Wakeham  himself  described  this  meeting  as  productive,  and  it 
appears that a common view was reached on the proposed criminal offences. By 8 February 
1994, Lord Brooke was proposing to circulate a draft of the White Paper which recommended 
the introduction of the new criminal offences. This draft of the White Paper was sent to the 
Prime Minister on 3 March.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.25  On  7  March  1994,  No  10  wrote  to  Lord  Brooke  asking  for  some  further  time  to  consider 
the White Paper, and on 31 March 1994 wrote again, asking him to recast the draft White 
Paper. The new draft was to make the case for the new criminal offences whilst balancing 
it with the arguments against; acknowledging the need for wide defence provisions against 
criminal offences but also the disadvantages of the offences with such defences included. 
This intervention marked a turning point in the history of the response to the recommended 
criminal offences.

2.26  The new draft White Paper was produced on 30 June 1994.70 The Chancellor of the Exchequer 
expressed some disappointment that there had been a retreat on the idea of new criminal 
offences.

2.27  By the time of Lord Brooke’s departure on 20 July 1994, it was clear that the Government‘s 
support for Sir David Calcutt’s recommendation for new criminal offences to be introduced 
was  beginning  to  wane.  Indeed,  as  will  be  seen,  no  new  criminal  offences  were  in  fact 
introduced.

Strand 3: civil offences

2.28  As referred to above, on 29 July 1993, the Lord Chancellor’s Department, in conjunction with 
the Scottish Office, published a consultation paper. This proposed the introduction of a civil 
penalty for infringement of privacy. Lord Brooke told the Inquiry that the Lord Chancellor was 
known to be of the view that his proposed tort would render unnecessary any changes to the 
criminal law.71

2.29 

In January 1994, the Lord Chancellor invited the Department of National Heritage to agree 
that  there  should  be  a  statutory  remedy  for  infringements  of  privacy,  arising  from  their 
conclusions on the July consultation paper that the civil law should be put on a statutory 
footing.

2.30  On 3 March 1994 Lord Brooke provided a draft White Paper to the Prime Minister on that 
basis. By the end of that month, the Prime Minister had asked him to redraft it. On the issue 
of the new tort, the new draft was to say that, although a new tort was under consideration, 
the inclusion by the PCC of like provisions within its own Code of Conduct would be even 
better. Again, by the time that Lord Brooke left office, it was clear that the Government had 
also retreated from this recommendation, preferring instead to encourage enhanced self-
regulation.

2.31 

The Rt Hon Stephen Dorrell MP
In July 1994, the Rt Hon Stephen Dorrell MP was appointed as Secretary of State for National 
Heritage; he therefore inherited the amended draft White Paper.72 The key conclusions of the 
White Paper were as follows:73

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I“The Government accepts the [Select] Committee’s analysis of the dilemma [posed 
by the need for a balance between freedom of expression and privacy] and agrees 
that, at the stage when Sir David Calcutt and the Committee reported, the necessary 
balance between these rights manifestly did not exist...
Since that time, however, the press has shown hopeful signs of greater self-restraint, 
and the PCC has improved its procedures and practices. There have been regrettable 
lapses by individual newspapers, and the Government is still to be convinced that the 
newspaper industry, through the PCC, is fully in control of its members and we have 
entered a new era of wholly responsible journalism. But it considers that statutory 
intervention at this stage would be out of proportion and possibly counter-productive. 
Nonetheless the Government would urge the industry to consider further the self-
regulatory improvements set out in paragraphs 2.36 to 2.39 and in paragraph 4.19 
... Failure to implement these changes, particularly if any such failure coincided with 
further press abuse, will incline the Government to introduce, or give support to any 
Private Members’ Bill introducing intrusion offences, a privacy tort, or both.”

2.32 

In written evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Dorrell indicated that his first instinct upon taking office 
was to take some time to reassess the various options. He noted as follows:74

“(a)   I  am  personally  hostile  to  any  proposal  for  official  regulation  of  freedom  of 

expression;

(b)    Quite apart from issues of principle, any proposal to regulate the activities of the 

press carries obvious political risks;

(c)    I was reluctant to publish the draft White Paper which combined a theoretical 
willingness to legislate (about which I was dubious) with practical unwillingness 
to do so (which I thought was unconvincing)75;

(d)    I  was  conscious  that  there  had  been  substantial  debate  before  I  took  office 
between senior members of government, some of whom were more sympathetic 
to a regulatory response than I was.”

2.33 

In his oral evidence Mr Dorrell was asked to elaborate why, in his view, the Government was 
so keen to avoid replacing the PCC. His explanation was as follows:76

“I  think  it  starts  as  an  issue  of  principle  ...  it  would  be  a  step  of  considerable 
constitutional significance ... There was also, because this was a real political world 
with a real political set of decisions, there was the reality that if you were going to 
even contemplate going down that road, you would encounter huge opposition from 
the press themselves, based both on principle and it’s often argued on self-interest, 
but it would be powerful, vigorous opposition, and that would, as a practical matter, 
have made it impossible for such a proposal to have been carried through the House 
of Commons. So whether you address it as an issue of principle or reality, it wasn’t an 
option that merited very serious consideration”.

of-Stephen-Dorrell-MP.pdf 
75 Mr Dorrell explained in oral evidence that “I think it was time in my mind for the government to stop talking in terms 
of threats, which it had no willingness to carry out, and indeed no ability to carry out and everybody knew that those 
things were true”; p8, lines 10-14, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-

1252

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.34  Mr Dorrell’s written evidence indicates that, as of November 1994, the imminent appointment 
of Lord Wakeham as Chair of the PCC prompted a dialogue with the PCC about the options for 
improving the self-regulatory structure, and that this dialogue continued into the early weeks 
of 1995. He described his objectives at that stage as being to develop the policy outlined in 
the draft White Paper so that:77

(a) 

(b) 

the Government could report that it had agreed improvements to the operations of the 
PCC which would justify its decision not to replace it; and
it could also report a clear conclusion – namely that it intended to proceed with its 
commitment to legislate the proposed criminal intrusion offences, and that it did not 
intend to proceed with legislation to introduce a new tort of infringement of privacy.

2.35  This policy position was summarised in a minute sent by Mr Dorrell to the Prime Minister on 
2 March 1995.78 This minute prompted responses from three Ministers, all of whom favoured 
proceeding with the policy position set out in the original draft White Paper.

2.36  On 20 March 1995, Mr Dorrell produced a further minute for the Prime Minister. This brought 
a number of matters to his attention. In relation to the proposed tort of privacy, the minute 
revealed a real concern about taking on the press, reading as follows: 79

“The tort would be the wrong thing at the wrong time. Most importantly, it would 
mean a major row with the press (the Daily Mail editorial of 16 March, annex B, is a 
good indication of the strength of feeling). By contrast, the press has never been in 
serious doubt that the criminal offences would be enacted” (emphasis added).

2.37  The relevant Daily Mail editorial was headed “Who are they to cry foul?” and started with 
the words “What is this profoundly unpopular government now doing?” It went on to recite 
the names of a number of Ministers “driven out of office by their own philandering and folly” 
and concluded that the Prime Minister must know that “in the current climate of sleaze and 
corruption any concerted political clamour for privacy legislation is liable to be dismissed as 
little better than a self-protection racket”.80

2.38  Mr Dorrell was asked whether he was concerned about press coverage of this nature. He 

explained: 81

“I was told early in my political life: any fool can have friends, it takes a wise man 
to have the right enemies. You have to pick which battles you’re going to fight. I’m 
not  in  favour  of  having  government  policy  determined  by  press  editorial,  but  nor 
am  I  in  favour,  in  the  real  world,  of  government  policy  being  determined  blind  to 
press editorial. You have to choose which arguments you’re going to have. One of the 
elements of that choice is that there’s not much point in the government committing 
itself to a course of action which, because of press hostility, it is profoundly unlikely to 
get through the House of Commons. That was in my judgment the position that would 
have been in if we’d contemplated going down the route of introducing legation and 
privacy.

Chapter 5 | Media Policy IQ:  It seems that editorials from the more influential papers like the Daily Mail were 
certainly having an effect on your thinking?
A:  Of  course.  That’s  part  of  the  public  discussion  and  I  think  it  would  be  –  for  a 
politician to deny that the views of newspaper editorials are taking into account in 
policy making would be both implausible and actually wrong in principle.”

2.39  A third minute was produced by Mr Dorrell for the Prime Minister on 24 April 1995. This 
minute  referred  to  a  request  from  the  Prime  Minister  as  to  how  the  Government  might 
present a “do nothing” option.82 Mr Dorrell was asked about this:83

“Q:  So can I take it from that that the Prime Minister was beginning to think in terms 
of a ‘do nothing’ option?
A:  I think it’s relatively hard to draw any other conclusion from this correspondence. 
The government was arguing itself to a standstill, and therefore there had to be – it 
was a reasonable question for him to ask. We had an obligation to reply to Calcutt. 
We also had an obligation to reply to a Select Committee report, which this response 
was by then two years behind schedule, so we had to bring the matter to a conclusion 
somehow.”

2.40  The  third  minute  accordingly  discussed  the  “do  nothing”  option.  It  explored  how  such  a 
decision could be presented. The practical options appeared to be: first, making no statement 
at all, second announcing that nothing was going to be done, or third making a statement 
which  (a)  confirmed  the  intention  to  legislate  the  intrusion  offences  when  Parliamentary 
time permits (italics in the original) and (b) asserted the preference for self-regulation in the 
wider field of privacy law but underlined that continued public confidence in this approach 
depended on the effectiveness of the PCC. When asked why the words “when Parliamentary 
time permits” was in italics, Mr Dorrell confirmed that this was because the real intention 
was in fact simply not to enact these provisions.84

2.41  Mr Dorrell’s minute expressed the view that the final option was the “least bad choice” and 
that although it would “take a good deal of brazening out, given the history”, it could not “be 
criticised as a substantive retreat, it avoids a head-on collision with the press and it gets the 
Select Committee off our backs”. He went on:85

“Q:  Can I suggest that this political debate and the consideration of the announcing 
“do  nothing”  and  the  third  option  of  saying  that  you’re  going  to  legislate  when 
Parliamentary time permits, is that an example of a phenomenon which has been 
referred to by Tony Blair of not being able to be entirely frank for fear of how matters 
will be perceived?
A:  I think that is a reasonable way of putting it, and I think it’s pretty explicit in the 
minute. I was asked to dress up a ‘do nothing’ option. One way of doing nothing is 
to announce that you’re going to do nothing, and I made it clear in the minute why, 
as a member of the government, that didn’t seem to me to be an attractive way of 
announcing it, but clearly the option (c) amounts to the same thing.
Q:  Indeed it wasn’t your preferred way forward, but a variation of the ‘do nothing’ 
option was in fact what happened, wasn’t it?
A:  Substantively, yes”.

1254

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.42  Thereafter,  Mr  Dorrell  produced  a  further  draft  White  Paper,  which  went  to  a  Cabinet 
Committee  meeting  which  was  held  on  15  June  1995.  This  set  out  Mr  Dorrell’s  preferred 
option,  namely  to  legislate  on  the  criminal  offences  but  not  the  tort,  and  it  encouraged 
the PCC to raise its game; but noted that the Government had no plans to replace it. No 
clear consensus appears to have been reached at that meeting, and Mr Dorrell explained in 
evidence that Ministers had differing views on the appropriate way forward.86

2.43  A number of discussions took place thereafter between No 10 and the Department of National 
Heritage, but matters were interrupted by the Prime Minister’s decision to resign his position 
as Leader of the Conservative Party on 22 June 1995. Following Sir John Major’s re-election, 
Mr Dorrell moved to the Department of Health.

2.44  Mr Dorrell was asked whether he considered that the Government’s response to Sir David’s 

second report had been a missed opportunity. Unlike Sir John Major, he did not think so: 87

“My basic response to that is no I don’t. First of all, at a purely mechanistic level, 
the ability to do anything fundamental in legislative terms I don’t think was there 
because, as I have already said, I don’t think in reality we’d have been able to carry 
legislation, so there was no opportunity, if that’s what you wanted to do. But ... I 
am not persuaded that if we go down the legislative route here we don’t create a 
problem, a cure that’s worse than the disease”.

Virginia Bottomley MP

2.45  The results of the discussions referred to above were the White Paper, published on 17 July 
1995, some two and a half years after the publication of Sir David’s second report. The Rt Hon 
Virginia Bottomley MP, now Baroness Bottomley, as the new Secretary of State for National 
Heritage,  was  responsible  for  its  publication.  The  key  points  of  the  White  Paper  were  as 
follows:88

“(a)   The  Government  does  not  find  the  case  for  statutory  measures  in  this  area 
compelling. It believes that, in principle, industry self-regulation is much to be 
preferred.

(b)    The Government has long recognised that there is, in principle, a case for the 
introduction of [new physical intrusion] offences ... The Government has however 
so far been unable to construct legislation which in practice would be sufficiently 
workable to be responsibly brought to the statute book.

(c)    In considering the results of the consultation [on the feasibility of introducing a 
new tort of the infringement of privacy] the Government draws two conclusions. 
First  it  does  not  believe  there  is  sufficient  public  consensus  on  which  to  base 
statutory intervention in this area. Secondly it strongly prefers the principle of 
self-regulation  ...  It  therefore  has  no  present  intention  to  legislate  a  new  civil 
remedy”.

2.46 

In summary, the PCC was to remain, and there was to be no new tort and no new criminal 
offences.

1255

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I2.47  Baroness Bottomley summarised the position she inherited as follows: 89

“Taking over in July 1995, I had little direct knowledge of the conditions prior to Sir 
David’s report. There was confidence that John Wakeham, as Chairman of the PCC, 
was  the  man  for  the  moment  and  would  lead  self  regulation  in  an  authoritative 
manner with, if necessary, greater menace than before”.

2.48  She therefore moved forward with the response to Calcutt largely as it had been prepared 
under  her  predecessor.  She  announced  to  Parliament  that  the  Government  would  “for 
the  present  allow  Lord  Wakeham’s  commission,  and  the  press,  to  demonstrate  that  self-
regulation can be made to work.”90 All three of the Calcutt recommendations for legislation 
were rejected and instead Baroness Bottomley told Parliament that she had written to Lord 
Wakeham setting out “further improvements that the Government wish to see both in the 
procedures of the PCC and in the code of practice itself.”91 Those improvements included the 
creation of a compensation fund from which the PCC would compensate those whose privacy 
had been violated by the press and a number of changes to the Code to place greater weight 
on the protection of individual privacy.92

2.49  This was a complete victory for Lord Wakeham and the press, delivered through negotiation 
with  the  Government  in  relation  to  the  improvements  that  could  be  delivered  through 
self-regulation.  Baroness  Bottomley  appeared  to  consider  that  the  Government  and  Lord 
Wakeham had an understanding and she presumed it would be honoured on both sides. She 
said: “I was satisfied that Lord Wakeham, who is not to be trifled with, had got the measure 
of the role. There were lists of improved reforms and mechanisms.”93

2.50  This  was  demonstrated,  for  example,  in  February  1996,  when  a  Private  Member’s  Bill  on 
protection  of  privacy  was  brought  forward,  Baroness  Bottomley  was  keen  to  honour  that 
agreement. In a letter to the Lord President of the Council she said: 94

“More importantly, the Bill would cut across our policy on press regulation. It would be 
strongly resisted by the media, and would undermine the position of John Wakeham, 
whose authority as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission is predicated on 
the Government’s assurance that it will not introduce legislation provided that he 
can make self-regulation work. For this reason alone, I think that the Bill should be 
blocked at Second reading.”

2.51  By the end of 1996, it was becoming clear that the PCC and the press had not delivered on 
all that the Government had asked, and expected, of it in 1995. An internal Department of 
Heritage review of press self-regulation for the Secretary of State concluded that95

“in certain crucial respects, and as shown by a series of unremedied press abuses, the 
weaknesses of self-regulation identified by the first review (covering July 1995-April 
1996) have not been addressed, largely because the industry and Commission have 
not implemented various recommendations which you [Mrs Bottomley] made”.

1256

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.52  The  Department  of  Heritage  note  recorded  agreement  with  Baroness  Bottomley  that  she 
should write to Lord Wakeham to seek assurances that there would be action on breaches 
without a complaint, as well as incorporation of guidance on the public interest. This note 
shines a very interesting light on the relationship that had hitherto existed between Baroness 
Bottomley  and  Lord  Wakeham.  Baroness  Bottomley  was  warned  that  seeking  assurances 
from Lord Wakeham which he was known not to be willing to give would be a distinct change 
of approach:96

“You  should  note  that  this  will  be  a  change  of  approach  to  the  Press  Complaints 
Commission. The two previous-exchanges with Lord Wakeham (i.e. the letters published 
in  July  1995  in  Privacy’and  Media  Intrusion,  and  those  referred  to  in  paragraph 
1 above) were agreed in draft by the recipient before they were sent, so that, for 
example, your letters to Lord Wakeham tended to be limited to recommendations 
which he personally favoured, which he thought the industry would accept, or which 
he felt he could reject or defer in a plausible way. Equally, we could ensure that his 
letters to you were less evasive than they might otherwise have been. I think that the 
difficulty with this method is that your letters push mostly at open doors, whereas it 
is the closed ones on which he has not been very forthcoming and which are at the 
root of the present failures of self-regulation.”

2.53 

It has not been possible to follow these policy developments from start to finish, but the 
evidence  presented  demonstrates  first,  that  the  1995  Government  response  to  Sir  David 
Calcutt’s report was developed on the basis of an understanding between the Government 
and Lord Wakeham (clearly acting on behalf of the press), and second, the limited extent to 
which even that understanding, so wholly in favour of the industry, was ultimately delivered 
by the industry or the PCC.

Lord Wakeham

2.54  Lord Wakeham said in evidence that he was appointed as a fixer, a man tasked with restoring 
the reputation of the PCC with leading figures within Government and of convincing the public 
of the effectiveness of the PCC.97 In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Wakeham summarised 
the thinking of the industry in relation to his appointment in this way:98

“I think the newspaper industry did not want statutory control and that they accepted 
they needed someone to be the chairman with a bit of clout, who could stop statutory 
control by getting the standards up to an acceptable level, and this was my view of 
what I thought they probably wanted.”

2.55  Lord Wakeham’s particular skills were certainly recognised at the highest levels of Government. 

Sir John Major said:99

“I think if you wanted someone who could guide the PCC to a better code of behaviour, 
it would have been difficult at the time to find anyone better than John Wakeham or 
more capable of being able to do it. Certainly he made some efforts to do it, but I 
think at the end John would concede there was more perhaps needed to be done than 
he was able to do. But it was perfectly credible to believe that he would achieve more

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I2.56  Sir John also made clear the political impact of Lord Wakeham’s appointment (as well as the 

intelligence of the industry decision) in these terms:100

“I mean, those who were at all queasy about it would then say, “Look, here is one 
of our own, a very respected former Cabinet Minister who is actually chairing the 
PCC. Therefore, why don’t we wait and see how well he gets on? Why rush ahead 
with legislation?” So his appointment did have a material effect upon views in the 
Parliamentary party.”

2.57  Lord Smith of Finsbury, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport between 1997 and 
2001, noted that the appointment of Lord Wakeham as Chair of the PCC represented a sea 
change in that organisation.101 He explained that Lord Wakeham moved to look seriously at 
how the powers of the PCC might be strengthened, stating that this was the first time that the 
PCC had demonstrated a preparedness to make real change. This, he suggested, led policy 
makers to be sufficiently impressed to remove the threat of concerted political action.102 This 
he asserts:103

“effectively ensure[d] that the Calcutt proposal for statutory intervention did not have 
political legs.”

2.58  Certainly, Lord Smith gave evidence that on his assumption to office, press reform was no 

longer an issue accorded any priority.104

2.59 

It may be argued that this was the purpose of Lord Wakeham’s appointment; in the words 
of  Lord  Smith,  to  “draw  the  sting”  of  political  pressure  for  greater  and  more  far-reaching 
reforms. Lord Wakeham was regarded as an able political operator and “was outstandingly 
skilful” in his efforts at reforming the PCC.105

2.60  The purpose of his appointment, however, has been open to question. On the one hand, it is 
argued that it was to make use of his finely tuned political antennae to deliver the minimum 
reform necessary to placate the proponents of greater press reform and preserve as much of 
the industry influence and control of the system of press self- regulation as possible. On the 
other hand, it is contended that this was a genuine attempt at reform, that ultimately though 
well intended fell short of delivering real and effective change. The third possibility is that 
Lord Wakeham’s tenure as Chair of the PCC fell somewhere between those two stools.

2.61  The role of Lord Wakeham is altogether more complex and nuanced than as the fixer he claims 
himself to be. He was also appointed as Chair to make certain that the PCC was satisfactory 
to the industry it sought to regulate. As the Report has noted, Lord Wakeham gave evidence 
that he was a strong supporter of both press freedom and self-regulation:106

“I don’t think you could be a chairman of a body that was running a system of self-
regulation unless you believed in self-regulation. I think that would be a bit difficult. 
And I can’t imagine you being a very good chairman of a Press Council if you didn’t 
believe in press freedom. I would have thought they were pretty self-evidently things 
that were required for the job.”

1258

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.62  The key to Lord Wakeham’s success was that he provided the Government with a solution 
to what had increasingly become an intractable problem. By the time Mr Dorrell became 
Secretary of State, the Government may have privately abandoned proposals to implement 
the recommendations of Sir David Calcutt’s second report. It seemed to those in Government, 
including Mr Dorrell, that the most effective way forward was through reform of the PCC 
itself. Lord Wakeham had the personality, status and apparent willingness to take that reform 
forward to the satisfaction of Government.107

2.63 

It  is  testament  to  the  political  skills  of  Lord  Wakeham  that,  in  this  particular  context,  the 
PCC emerged as a potential solution to the issue of privacy.108 Additionally, it was fortuitous 
for  Government  that  Lord  Wakeham  moved  quickly  to  introduce  reforms  to  make  the 
PCC  more  credible.  These  included,  for  example,  the  strengthening  of  the  position  of  the 
Privacy Commissioner, and the appointment of men of stature to key positions within that 
organisation, about which Lord Wakeham said:109

“Well, I suppose this is the flipside of me being appointed as the chairman. I mean, 
things were changing and here it seemed to me that it was important to try and get 
the  Press  Complaints  Commission  more  highly  respected  and  therefore  to  get  the 
right people and have the right people appointing them seemed to me to be a move 
in the right direction.’”

2.64  By the  time that  Baroness  Bottomley took  over as  Secretary of  State, it  is  clear that  Lord 
Wakeham was successfully influencing Government policy, very much to the advantage of 
the PCC and the press without distinction between the two.

Sir John Major

2.65  The first Calcutt report was published a few months before Sir John Major became Prime 
Minister, but the second report was published in January 1993 when he had been in that 
position  for  a  number  of  years  and  had,  of  course,  been  returned  to  power  following  his 
election victory in April 1992. Asked about his direct role in responding to Sir David’s second 
report, he said this:110

“Well, I didn’t acquire direct ownership of the issue, certainly not. It was one of 20 
or 30 – there are 30 to 40 issues a day that cross a Prime Minister’s desk. The fact 
of the matter is that he or she can almost never have direct ownership of an issue. It 
has to be sub-contracted to the appropriate Secretary of State and the appropriate 
Cabinet committee and that is what happened with the Calcutt Report ... The day-
to-day detail of examination, of what is a very complex matter ... was predominantly 
in the hands of the Secretary of State, although when things were snarled up, they 
were reported back to me and I became sucked in, in terms of expressing an opinion 
and inviting people to go back and look at something again or recognising that it 
wouldn’t work”.

1259

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I2.66  Sir John was asked in evidence about the three ‘strands’ to the Calcutt recommendations. As 

to the recommendation for an independent tribunal, he noted:111

“The grounds of principle we had in mind was the freedom of the press to comment. 
That was why we regarded the idea of a statutory tribunal as very much as a last 
resort and something that we were not at the time attracted to.”

2.67  As to the proposed privacy tort, he noted:112

“There were several difficulties with the tort of privacy. One of the difficulties was 
that  it  was  very  easy  to  portray  a  tort  of  privacy  as  being  a  piece  of  legislation 
that favoured people who were relatively well off and relatively well organised but 
without complete access to legal aid for everyone would not be available to be used 
by the vast majority of people ... The other point about the tort of privacy was that 
it became apparent in the deliberations of the Cabinet subcommittee was that there 
was a very substantial philosophical difference within the Conservative Party, within 
ministers, as to the desirability of a tort of privacy.
Some thought it would be very difficult to frame and might only be unfairly framed 
and that would be unfair on the media. Others thought it would provoke such hostility 
that it would dwarf everything else that the government were doing. To that extent, 
some of them were very wary. Others were simply philosophically unsure that it was 
the right time and right place to actually go down that route.
There was a universality of opinion across the press that the tort in particular would 
be very damaging to investigative journalism. That was their view and they expressed 
it very forcibly in the columns of their newspapers ... It was a universality of opposition 
that we thought would spill out beyond opposition to that into opposition on wider 
areas of policy as well. The government would, in effect, become tainted. I think some 
colleagues felt that and there would be a general opposition to what the government 
were doing and not just an opposition focussed on that particular piece of legislation 
and that particular provision.”113

2.68  As to the proposed criminal offences:114

“I asked the then Secretary of State why he felt that the press weren’t very concerned 
about the criminal clauses and he said that was what they had told him in discussion. 
I don’t suggest that they were enthusiastic; I suggest that there wasn’t a last-ditch 
determination by the media to have fought against that”.

2.69  Asked why, in general terms, the Government had been unable to implement any of the main 

Calcutt recommendations, he said as follows:115

“The principal reason, at the end of the day – not the only reason, but the principal 
reason, at the end of the day, why we were unable to enact Calcutt is that we could 
not have got it through the House of Commons. If you cannot get something through 
the  House  of  Commons,  you  are  powerless.  That  is  the  difference  between  –  a 
government with a large majority can force something through. A government with a 
small majority – and in the 1990s we had a small majority to start with and it shrank

handful of Members of Parliament in your own party, quite apart from the opposition 
you can expect from parties other than your own”.

2.70  He also noted that the appointment of Lord Wakeham as Chairman of the PCC had also had 

a significant effect:116

“It would have been difficult at the time to find anyone better than John Wakeham 
or more capable of being able to do it ... I mean, those who were at all queasy about 
[statutory regulation] would then say: ‘Look, here is one of our own, a very respected 
former Cabinet minister who is actually chairing the PCC. Therefore, why don’t we wait 
and see how well he gets on? Why rush ahead with legislation?’ So his appointment 
did have a material effect upon views in the Parliamentary party”.

2.71  Asked about the ‘do nothing’ option contained in the minute of 24 April 1995, Sir John gave 
evidence as to why Mr Dorrell was asked to explore this option, and why it was the option 
eventually chosen:117

“We couldn’t carry anything through Parliament, and at the time, I think we had a 
majority of – I think our majority had fallen to single figures by then. So we were 
talking about a majority of nine and arguably the most contentious piece of legislation 
that anyone could have seen for quite a long time.”

2.72 

In his written evidence, Sir John expressed the view that the failure to implement any of the 
Calcutt review recommendations was a ‘missed opportunity’. Asked to elaborate on this in 
oral evidence, he said:118

“Well, I do. I do feel that. I think many of the things that have happened subsequently 
that have led to this Inquiry may not have happened if we had been able to enact, 
and I think in the interest if the good majority of the press, the press wouldn’t have 
fallen into the disrepute in which the criminal activities have laid it. If these changes 
had been made, I don’t think many of the things that subsequently happened would 
have happened. So in that sense it was a missed opportunity. But it was a missed 
opportunity  which  was  unavoidable.  It  wasn’t  a  missed  opportunity  because  we 
shirked it. It was a missed opportunity because we couldn’t do it” (emphasis added)

Reflections

2.73  The triumph of the ‘do nothing option’ demonstrates the way in which the press and the 
politicians have worked together on questions of media policy. In this case, the context was of 
a reactive policy: both the Government and the industry leaders were responding to external 
events.

2.74  First, doing nothing is both recognisable and perfectly legitimate in very many areas of policy 
and politics; there are many competing demands on the political agenda and public concern 
about  press  standards  was,  in  a  pre-internet  age,  afforded  little  publicity.  Doing  anything, 
particularly in this area, is always more difficult. Second, the press objected to the proposals 
both vociferously and comprehensively, deploying the megaphone at full volume. Third, they 
overtly attacked the authority of the Government to take any action at all in relation to the

1261

Chapter 5 | Media Policy Ipress, mired as it was in ‘sleaze’ allegations. Those allegations had of course been considerably 
amplified  by  the  press  itself;  holding  power  uncomfortably  to  account,  no  doubt,  but  not 
necessarily disinterestedly. Fourth, without cross-party Parliamentary consensus and a powerful 
Government mandate, the lobbying by the press was impossible to withstand. Fifth, the PCC 
had appointed a Chair, in the person of Lord Wakeham, who was himself a skilled politician and 
advocate, and who had developed alternative proposals which appeared sufficiently plausible 
to be capable of being presented to the public as an adequate improvement. It is little wonder 
that Sir John Major, personally undermined and faced with a very small majority in the House 
of Commons, found himself with no alternative to the ‘do nothing option’.

2.75 

I have no doubt that the success of this strategy would have left an indelible impression on 
the press and politicians alike.

3.6 

Introduction
The Long Title of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA) states that it is designed to “give further 
effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights”. 
In the preface to the White Paper “Rights Brought Home”, the Prime Minister explained that 
the HRA was intended to “give people in the UK opportunities to enforce their rights under the 
European Convention in British courts rather than having to incur the cost and delay of taking 
a case to the European Court of Human Rights”.119

A great deal has been written about the HRA, the debates in Parliament when the Bill was 
being passed, and precisely what it was intended to achieve. No such exercise is required in 
this context. This section of the Report seeks solely to ascertain the concerns of the press 
during  the  passage  of  the  Bill  through  Parliament,  and  to  set  out  the  basis  on  which  any 
amendments and concessions were made following lobbying efforts carried out directly or 
on their behalf.

It  is  clear  that  the  initial  publication  of  the  Human  Rights  Bill  by  the  incoming  Labour 
Government led to substantial concerns being expressed by most sections of the press.

First, there was a general concern about a “judge-made” privacy law which the Human Rights 
Act in general might lead to. Initially at least, the press argued that in order to avoid this, they 
should be excluded from the ambit of the Human Rights Act entirely.

Second, but linked to the general concern, a number of specific concerns were expressed, 
in  particular  about  pre-action  restraint  in  privacy  cases.  Representations  were  made  to 
the  effect  that  pre-trial  injunctions  should  be  granted  in  privacy  cases  in  only  the  most 
exceptional of circumstances. The press argued that in general terms the Bill should ensure 
that complainants make full use of the PCC rather than the courts.

As a result, what followed was sustained lobbying, and then detailed negotiations between 
government and Lord Wakeham, Chair of the PCC at that time. In summary, although the 
Government took the view that the press should not be excluded from the ambit of the HRA, 
these negotiations led to the enactment of section 12. This provides as follows:

119 Rights Brought Home (Cm 3782), 1997, p1

1262

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“12  Freedom of Expression

(1) This section applies if a court is considering whether to grant any relief which, 
if  granted,  might  affect  the  exercise  of  the  Convention  right  to  freedom  of 
expression.

(2) If the person against whom the application for relief is made (‘the respondent’) 
is neither present nor represented, no such relief is to be granted unless the 
court is satisfied –
(a) That the applicant has taken all practicable steps to notify the respondent; 

or

(b) That  there  are  compelling  reasons  why  the  respondent  should  not  be 

notified.

(3) No such relief is to be granted so as to restrain publication before trial unless 
the court is satisfied that the applicant is likely to establish that publication 
should not be allowed.

(4) The court must have particular regard to the importance of the Convention 
right to freedom of expression and, where the proceedings relate to material 
which the respondent claims, or which appears to the court, to be journalistic, 
literary or artistic material (or to conduct connected with such material), to –
(a) The extent to which –

(i)  The material has, or is about to, become available to the public; or
(ii)  It is, or would be, in the public interest for the material to be published;

(b) Any relevant privacy code.

“court” includes a tribunal; and
“relief” includes any remedy or order (other than in criminal proceedings).”

3.7 

The Role of Lord Wakeham
Lord Wakeham, who had been a Conservative member of the House of Lords since 1992,120 
became Chair of  the PCC in  January 1995. Given his  background,  and  his  commitment to 
the principles of self-regulation and freedom of the press, it would be surprising if he did 
not have strong personal views about the Human Rights Bill. In the event, he led support of 
the case the press was advancing with enthusiasm and effectiveness. Questions arise as to 
whether in doing so he was speaking on behalf of the PCC (as its Chair), the press as a whole, 
or both. On that point, Lord Wakeham said this in his evidence to the Inquiry:121

“I must make it clear that throughout the discussions on the Bill, I never acted as a 
‘representative of the press’. My concern was always with the future of self-regulation, 
and the way in which the human rights legislation might undermine it.”

120 he was Secretary of State for Energy between 1989 and 1992, and Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords 
between 1992 and 1994

Wakeham.pdf 

1263

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I3.8 

Asked about this in oral evidence, Lord Wakeham expanded as follows:122

“Q:  Some commentators have said that it is simply inappropriate for the chairman 
of the regulator, who’s meant to be, at the end of the day, an impartial mediator 
and  complaints  handler,  to  essentially  lobby  on  behalf  of  the  press  in  respect  of 
government decisions that might affect the press’ commercial interests ...
A:  I was never a regulator. I never said I was a regulator. I didn’t pretend to be a 
regulator. My task was to try and raise standards in the press by means of a code and 
by self-regulation. You have to bear in mind that when I went there, the press had 
been governed previously by the Press Council, and there ... wasn’t a code. We were 
the starting of the code. It was pretty crude when we started, and we refined it, but 
at no time was it a regulator’s job. It was a job of raising standards in self-regulation.
Q:  Did you speak to the press industry when the human rights bill was going through 
Parliament? Did you speak to representatives of the press industry?
A:  I can’t remember doing so. I can’t absolutely swear that I never spoke to a journalist 
at any time about it, but I certainly wasn’t representing them. My concern was for the 
public. The Press Complaints Commission, in my view, was the best way of protecting 
the public and I didn’t want to see it destroyed in the way that it more or less has been 
in the last few years.”

3.9  Whether or not the PCC was a regulator in the full sense of that term, a question arises about 
how far Lord Wakeham as the Chair of the self-regulatory body charged with the responsibility 
for resolving press complaints should have been speaking out in support of the case which the 
press clearly espoused. He would doubtless have been aware of the position the press was 
taking on these issues regardless of whether he discussed them with journalists and editors. 
In any event, the connection between the role of the PCC in maintaining press standards and 
opposing the Human Rights Bill insofar as it related to the press is not immediately apparent.

3.10  Other witnesses disagreed with Lord Wakeham’s recollection. Asked about a debate in the 
House of Commons during the second reading of the Bill, the Rt Hon Jack Straw MP gave 
evidence to the Inquiry as follows:123

Q:  Then ... you make it clear that there were discussions which involved you, the late 
Lord Williams and Lord Wakeham ... “The new clause was drafted in consultation 
with  Lord  Wakeham  and  representatives  of  the  national  and  regional  press.  They 
have given it a warm welcome.” So the upshot is that part of the explanation for the 
genesis of section 12, a consultation, agreement if you like, which you reach with Lord 
Wakeham, who may well have been speaking for a large section of the press. Is that 
fair?
A:  Yes.  He  was  certainly  speaking  for  a  large  section  of  the  press.  Whatever  his 
position in the House of Lords, he was chairman of the Press Complaints Commission 
...  I  mean,  it  wasn’t  a  piece  of  private  enterprise  by  Lord  Wakeham.  There  would 
have been no purpose served in busy ministers spending their time speaking to Lord 
Wakeham if this was just a sort of personal foible. He had a very influential position 
and he was tending to speak on behalf of the press ... I worked on the basis that if I 
could square Lord Wakeham, I’d square most sections of the press, which is what I 
wanted to do”.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.11 

Concerns of the press and lobbying
In any event, regardless of whether he formally represented the interests and concerns of 
the press, it is clear that Lord Wakeham played a central role in advancing the arguments 
which the press would have wished to raise. On 12 January 1998 Lord Wakeham wrote to 
Lord Smith,124 the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, expounding his principal 
concerns about the Bill:125

“... there are two central problems with the Bill. The first is the issue of prior restraint 
– and the new arsenal of weapons that will be available to the rich, the corrupt and 
those comfortable with the courts to gag newspapers. The second is whether the PCC 
should be a public authority within the terms of the Bill – and therefore the sort of 
legal entity which the newspaper industry never intended it to be”.

3.12  The issue of ‘prior restraint’ is explained below: in fact, it came to the fore slightly later in the 
chronological sequence. The second issue is technical, but may be boiled down to this. If the 
PCC was a public authority within the meaning of what is now section 6 of the HRA, then it 
would be unlawful for it to act incompatibly with any human right. It was believed, or feared, 
at the time – depending on one’s point of view – that the effect of incorporating Article 8 of 
the Convention into domestic law would be to create a privacy law ‘by the back door’. Subject 
to the application of section 6, the PCC would become bound to apply it.

3.13  Lord Wakeham made two speeches in the House of Lords during the Committee stage and 
the Third Reading of the Human Rights Bill. In written evidence, he explained that his view 
was that:126

“The Bill as drafted would damage the freedom of the press and badly wound the 
system of tough and effective self regulation that we have built up to provide quick 
remedies without cost for ordinary citizens. It would inevitably produce a privacy law, 
despite the Government’s stated opposition to one”.

3.14 

Initially, the press through Lord Wakeham tried to obtain a complete exemption from the 
HRA. Lord Wakeham accepted this in oral evidence, also noting that he did not expect that 
this would be considered acceptable:127

“Q:  Did you initially seek to get the press a complete exemption from the provisions 
of the Human Rights Act?
A:  I certainly did, with absolutely no chance whatsoever of getting it through the 
House of Lords, but I wanted to raise the issue, which was important. I have to tell you 
that Parliament is in favour of strengthening restraints on the press whenever they 
find an opportunity, and if there’s any legislation flows from the circumstances we’re 
in, I have considerable reservations as how it would get on in Parliament.”

124 now, the Rt Hon Lord Smith of Finsbury

1265

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I3.15 

In oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Straw explained why Lord Wakeham’s assessment that he 
had ‘absolutely no chance whatsoever of getting it through the House of Lords’ was correct:128

“... Lord Wakeham went on to say that there was a second issue, which he described 
as far more serious, which was whether the PCC should be a public authority within 
the terms of the bill. In fact, the PCC was not a public authority within the terms of 
the Bill, but what the PCC were trying to secure was a situation where the media were 
outwith the impact of the Bill so you just drew a ring around them somehow and they 
be excluded from any adjudication on the conflict between Article 8 and Article 10 
or anything else. Now, that was just impossible to meet, and I had to explain that to 
them, and we didn’t meet it.
It’s  also  simply  incorrect  for  anyone  now  to  say  that  nobody  knew  that  a  Human 
Rights Act would lead to a law of privacy. Of course they did. They said so. But as I 
brought out in my Gareth Williams lecture, we all knew it was going to do that. That 
was discussed endlessly in Parliament.”

3.16 

I now turn to the issue of ‘prior restraint’, in relation to which Lord Wakeham also made strong 
representations. What this issue amounted to concerned the legal test the High Court should 
apply in granting without notice injunctions  in privacy cases: in essence, Lord Wakeham’s 
contention was that it should be more difficult for privacy claimants to obtain such injunctions 
than would ordinarily be the case because the right to freedom of expression would always 
be in play.129 Here, it is fair to point out that the reasons he advanced back in 1998 were 
broadly similar to the reasons he gave to the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions in 
2011:130

“My concern was to stop privacy cases by and large coming to the courts at all. I 
wanted people who felt they were done down by the press to go to something less 
than court. You only have to look in the papers the other day; it cost a footballer half 
a million pounds to bring a privacy action, which he lost. That is of no use to the vast 
majority of my old constituents ... I wanted section 12 to try to encourage the use 
of the Press Complaints Commission and therefore people would not come to court 
nearly as much so we could deal with it....”

3.17  On this issue Lord Wakeham received a sympathetic ear from Government. The Inquiry heard 
evidence that extensive negotiations took place between Lord Wakeham, Lord Smith and Mr 
Straw who was then the Home Secretary. Mr Straw explained in oral evidence to the Inquiry 
why he took the view that these negotiations were both necessary and appropriate:131

“I  was  very  anxious  to  achieve  a  consensus  on  this  legislation  because  I  have  a 
principle which is that major constitutional change should only go through if there is 
some kind of greater legitimacy, either through a consensus in Parliament or through 
a referendum, and the Conservatives were opposing the bill at second reading and I 
was anxious to see whether we could reach an accommodation so we could get their 
endorsement to it. Also I thought a part of what Lord Wakeham and the PCC were 
saying was reasonable. [On the issue of prior restraint] ... I thought they had a point 
there”.

129 the text of section 12 is set out above. It is a procedural provision which applies only to the grant of interim 
injunctions where the proposed respondent to the application is neither present nor represented. The test in s12 is 
higher than the legal test which ordinarily applies to the grant of such injunctions

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.18  During the Committee stage debate in the House of Commons,132 Mr Straw explained that the 
need for a more onerous legal test reflected a principle already recognised by the European 
Court of Human Rights:133 “The dangers inherent in prior restraints are such that they call for 
the most careful scrutiny on the part of the court. This is especially so as far as the press is 
concerned, for news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short 
period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest”. Mr Straw added that in the light of 
this principle, the Government believed that:134

“The courts should consider the merits of an application when it is made and should 
not grant an interim injunction simply to preserve the status quo ante between the 
parties”.

3.19  Lord Wakeham gave evidence as to precisely how section 12 of the HRA came about, including 

the nature of his involvement in its genesis. In written evidence, he explained as follows:135

“... I believe Jack Straw understood ... [my views] more clearly ... When the Bill moved 
from the Lords to the Commons in the spring of 1998, he moved swiftly to try to deal 
with some of the issues that were raised and what became Section 12 was the result. 
Jack worked closely with me on the wording of the amendment, and we eventually 
agreed it at a hastily arranged meeting at Heathrow Airport.
I believe Section 12 was the best compromise that was likely to have been achieved 
in the circumstances. It tried to tackle the issue of prior restraint and in Jack Straw’s 
phrase in the House of Commons, ‘preserve self regulation’. But it has – as the recent 
rows over super-injunctions have shown – only been partially successful.”

3.20  The evidence of Lord Wakeham and Mr Straw therefore appears to be consistent. Mr Straw 
also accepted that the Government agreed to the inclusion of section 12 having regard to the 
concerns of the press. On 2 July 1998 the Bill had reached its second reading in the House of 
Commons. Mr Straw was asked at the Inquiry about a debate which took place on that day:136

“Q:  You were debating what was then clause 13, which became section 12, and ... 
you  told  the  Commons:  “As  the  Committee  will  know,  there  was  concern  in  some 
sections  of  the  press  that  the  bill  might  undermine  press  freedom  and  result  in  a 
privacy law by the back door.” And then you say that was not the government’s view 
and you’ve dealt with the issue.
A:  Yes.
Q:  But on the issue of prior restraint and what became section 12, the third paragraph, 
you say: “We recognise the concerns expressed in the press. As I have made clear, 
for example in respect of the bill’s impact on the churches, we are anxious to deal 
constructively with them. In the light of those concerns we decided to introduce a 
new clause specifically designed to safeguard press freedom. We thought long and 
hard about it...”.
A:  Yes.”

1267

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I3.21  Even so, it would be going too far to conclude that the Government introduced what became 
section 12 on account of the concerns of the press and for no other reason. Taking Mr Straw’s 
evidence as a whole, he made it clear that there were other reasons for ‘raising the bar’ in 
relation to the grant of without notice interim injunctions. Press concerns may have been a 
factor to which the Government had regard, and there may have been a form of compromise 
as to the precise wording of the provision; this appears to have been a case in which the 
thrust of overall Government policy and the interests of the press came into alignment.

3.22 

I do not overlook the evidence of Mr Blair who placed a somewhat different interpretation 
of these events:137

“Q.  Was it the position that News International – I suppose together with everybody 
else – were lobbying for complete press immunity from the Human Rights Act?
A.  Yes,  that’s  right.  They  wanted  no  suggestion  that  you  would  move  outside  the 
bounds of the PCC and self-regulation.
Q.  And were you generally supportive of that position?
A.  Yes, that was – I mean, my – my view was that if you were to deal with this, you 
had to deal with it head on, as it were, not through the Human Rights Act, which 
would be a sort of side way of dealing with it. Also, at that time, I think I’m right in 
saying it was Lord Wakeham who was head of the PCC, who was something actually 
I thought was doing quite a good job of that, and the PCC were pretty fierce on this, 
on behalf the whole of the media, really, not any one particular part of it.
Q.  Was the position reached that following, if I can put it in these terms, pressure 
from Lord Irvine – of course then your Lord Chancellor, who I think was responsible for 
piloting the act through Parliament generally, certainly of course through the Lords 
– that he persuaded you that your position was incorrect and we ended up with a 
compromise, which we see in the form of Section 12 of the Act?
A.  That’s right.
Q.  In terms, though, of what your position was, what was the problem in allowing 
a privacy law to develop incrementally through Article 8, which is what would have 
happened – indeed has happened in any event – with the introduction of the Act in 
the form in which we now see it?
A.  As I say, I felt we should still be with the self-regulation argument, and I knew 
that we were going to have quite a big battle over it if we changed that position. In 
the end, we did come to a compromise, and I think that compromise was perfectly 
sensible, by the way.”

3.23 

I  can  quite  understand  how  from  Mr  Blair’s  perspective,  section  12  appeared  to  be  a 
compromise; he after all was supportive of the press case for complete exemption from the 
scope of the HRA. But the evidence of Lord Wakeham and Mr Straw clearly demonstrates 
that complete immunity was unrealistic and unacceptable, not least from the point of view 
of public opinion.

1268

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIAftermath

3.24  A number of academic commentators have taken the view that the press concerns about 
the application of the HRA and any satisfaction they may have gained from section 12 were 
misplaced.  They  argue  that  irrespective  of  the  HRA,  judges  were  already  developing  the 
common law of breach of confidence to protect privacy. They also argue that the Government 
did not intend by section 12 to include any provision which required the courts to do more 
than apply the principles set out in the Convention, and that it would have been pointless to 
attempt to do so in any event, as the UK’s international obligations would permit persons who 
took the view that domestic law inadequately protects their rights to bring a claim against the 
UK in the European Court of Human Rights.138

3.25  However, evidence given to the Inquiry by a number of media lawyers was to the effect that 
the procedural provisions of section 12 have, in fact, afforded considerable protection to the 
press. Mark Thomson, of Atkins Thomson Solicitors, put it this way:139

“It is important to note that section 12 of the HRA has made the threshold tests for 
interim injunctions harder to obtain than before – in effect, a potential claimant has 
to show that he or she would be more likely than not to succeed at trial on proving the 
threatened publication is unlawful. Despite what the press say, for an interim court 
measure, that is a high threshold, and one which is meant to reflect the importance of 
freedom of speech. This point was recognised by Jack Straw and Professor Phillipson 
in their evidence before the Select Committee.”

3.26  Mr Straw gave similar evidence to the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions, on 17 

October 2011:140

“Lord Wakeham has kindly reminded me of what I said [at the time] ... it was words to 
the effect that the introduction of section 12 should make these interlocutory injunctions 
pretty rare, and people in general would go to the Press Complaints Commission. We 
can argue about the extent to which they are relatively rare. There has been a lot of 
publicity about individual ones, but they are fewer in number than is imagined”.

3.27  Nonetheless, it is necessary to keep this in perspective. As already pointed out at paragraph 
3.18  above  above,  section  12  of  the  HRA  broadly  reflected  principles  laid  down  by  the 
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

3.28 

Reflections
It is clear that the press in general, and Lord Wakeham in particular, lobbied heavily against 
the Human Rights Bill insofar as it related to the press and related freedom of expression 
issues. It is also clear that section 12 of the HRA was seen at the time as a form of compromise 
between competing interests. Even so, the robust evidence received from Mr Straw suggests 
that, although press/Wakeham lobbying had an influence on the ultimate course of events, 
there were other sound reasons for enacting section 12.

1269

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I3.29  Section 12 did not of course create a complete immunity for the press from the ambit of the 
HRA. Following the comment that Lord Wakeham made to the Joint Committee on Privacy 
and  Injunctions  to  the  effect  that  he  was  disappointed  that  section  12  had  not  achieved 
what had been hoped and that he wanted to encourage the use of the PCC,141 there was the 
following exchange:142

Q  (Lord Greenford): Do you think you succeeded in making freedom of expression 
superior to the right of privacy?
Lord Wakeham: No, I do not. I think there was a balance, but the balance was not 
even-steven. What I thought I had achieved was what Jack Straw said in the House 
of Commons when he introduced section 12; I thought he got it exactly right at that 
time. It has not worked out like that, and I am disappointed.”

3.30  On the other hand, Professor Gavin Phillipson told the Joint Committee:143

“Can I just add that there was nothing in section 12 to suggest that cases should be 
steered off to the Press Complaints Commission? Section 12 tells the courts what to 
do. It does not say anything about whether or not someone would prefer to go to the 
PCC and there is nothing in it to say that injunctions will be rare. It simply says that 
injunctions will be granted only if the court thinks that the claimant has the stronger 
case. If the claimant has the stronger case they will get the injunction”.

4.	 Data	Protection	Act	1998

4.1 

Introduction
On 10 May 2006, the Information Commissioner published his report to Parliament entitled 
“What  Price  Privacy?  The  Unlawful  Trade  in  Confidential  Personal  Information”.144  The 
background  to,  and  the  contents  of,  this  report  and  the  follow-up  report  entitled  “What 
Price Privacy Now?” are both covered in greater detail in Part H above in the context of a 
broader discussion of the work of the Information Commissioner. This section of the Report is 
devoted to narrower questions relating to the way in which s77-78 of the Criminal Justice and 
Immigration Act 2008 came to be enacted, but not implemented and, in particular, how far 
press influence was brought to bear on Government policy in relation to these amendments 
to the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA).

4.2 

In this context, it is unnecessary to address any, save one of the issues raised in the Information 
Commissioner’s reports to Parliament. The first report, What Price Privacy?, made the case 
for increasing the maximum penalty for the offence of misuse of personal data in breach of 
s55 of the DPA from a fine to a custodial sentence of two years. The Foreword to What Price 
Privacy? encapsulated the matter thus:145

“The crime at present carries no custodial sentence. When cases involving the unlawful 
procurement  or  sale  of  confidential  personal  information  come  before  the  courts, 
convictions often bring no more than a derisory fine or a conditional discharge. Low

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIpenalties devalue the data protection offence in the public mind and mask the true 
seriousness of the crime, even within the judicial system. They likewise do little to 
deter those who seek to buy or supply confidential information that should rightly 
remain private. The remedy I am proposing is to introduce a custodial sentence of up 
to two years for persons convicted on indictment, and up to six months for summary 
convictions. The aim is not to send more people to prison but to discourage all who 
might be tempted to engage in this unlawful trade.”

In  order  to  give  effect  to  these  recommendations,  primary  legislation  would  need  to  be 
enacted to alter the maximum penalties laid down in s60 of the DPA for breaches of s55. The 
ICO noted that a follow-up report would be published within six months in order to monitor 
progress on the recommendations made.

At  least  initially,  the  Government  appeared  to  be  amenable  in  principle  to  introducing 
a  custodial  sanction  in  line  with  the  ICO’s  recommendation.  The  Foreword  of  What  Price 
Privacy? concluded with the observation that preliminary discussions with the Government 
had been encouraging:146

“These concerns, and the need for increased penalties, have been raised with the 
Department  for  Constitutional  Affairs.  The  positive  response  that  I  have  received 
so far is encouraging. These are early and welcome indications of progress on the 
possibility of Government action.”

On 24 July 2006, the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) published a consultation 
paper on increasing the penalties for breaches of s55.147 This sought views on whether the 
proposed custodial sentences would act as an effective deterrent to those who deliberately 
or recklessly misused personal information. The consultation period ended on 30 October 
2006.

Responses to the consultation document
The  majority  of  respondents  welcomed  the  introduction  of  custodial  sentences.  They 
indicated  that  the  introduction  of  such  sentences  would  provide  a  greater  deterrence  to 
potential offenders, provide public reassurance that offenders would receive the appropriate 
sentence, and achieve parity with a number of disparate pieces of legislation which dealt 
with similar offences.

However, although the ICO’s recommendations were not specifically targeted at the press, 
it was the press that co-ordinated the vociferous formal objections to them. In response to 
the  consultation,  the  press  strongly  argued  that  the  introduction  of  such  penalties  would 
have a ‘chilling effect’ on journalism and that this was contrary to the principle of freedom of 
expression.

Notwithstanding these objections, the Government’s position remained that the introduction 
of custodial sentences was both appropriate and in accordance with the views of the majority 
of  respondents  to  the  consultation  document.  By  the  time  the  ICO’s  follow-up  report,

Chapter 5 | Media Policy IConfidential Personal Information148 was published in December 2006, the ICO considered 
itself to have achieved some success. Not only had the consultation paper received a majority 
of favourable responses, but What Price Privacy Now? had attracted a significant amount of 
public attention and media coverage. The follow-up report concluded that the ICO would:149

“...continue to press the government to introduce the option of a prison sentence and 
see this progress report as supporting that goal.”

4.9 

On 7 February 2007, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, Lord Falconer of Thoroton 
QC, made the following statement in the House of Lords:150

“I  have  today  published  the  Government  response  to  the  consultation  paper 
“Increasing Penalties for Deliberate and Wilful Misuse of Public Data” (C/P9/06)… 
The  response  sets  out  how  we  will  reform  section  60  of  the  Data  Protection  Act 
1998 to ensure that there is robust protection for personal data, and to strengthen 
individuals’  right  to  privacy….  The  Government  believe  that  the  existing  financial 
penalties are not sufficiently protecting people’s personal data.
…
In  summary,  following  careful  consideration  of  the  responses  received,  we  are 
proceeding with the proposals to introduce custodial sentences to section 60 of the 
Data Protection Act. The Government are clear that custodial penalties will be reserved 
for the most serious breaches of the Act. We will seek to introduce an amendment to 
the Act as soon as parliamentary time allows.”

The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill

4.10  By clause 75 (later clause 129) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, it was proposed 
to amend s60 of the DPA to increase the penalties for offences under s55 of the Act, to allow 
for a period of imprisonment of up to six months following summary conviction and up to 
two years following conviction on indictment. It is important to note that, at that stage, the 
Government did not have in mind any other alteration to the law such as the introduction of 
a subjective element to the existing public interest defence.151

4.11  The Bill received its Second Reading in the House of Commons on 8 October 2007, and at that 
stage Clause 75 did not appear to be generating any serious controversy. As at 27 November 
2007, the Government was still actively rejecting any suggestion that this clause could have 
a ‘chilling effect’ on the press, and were pressing ahead with the relevant amendments.152

4.12  However, in early 2008 it became clear that the press was organising a serious and concerted 
campaign against the proposals. The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP was Secretary of State for Justice 
during  the  relevant  period.153  His  written  evidence  records  that  he  received  a  number  of 
representations from members of the press particularly in January 2008, and that a number 
of meetings to discuss the press concerns were held.154

1272

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.13  By February 2008, and following continued vociferous representations from the press, the 
Government  was  proposing  to  withdraw  clause  75  (now  clause  129)  completely.  The  ICO 
expressed deep regret at this proposed course of action.155 A letter from Mr Richard Thomas 
dated 4 March 2008 noted that:

“The representations against the measure from media organisations have not been 
convincing. In effect, they are arguing against a criminal offence which has been on 
the statute for many years. They object to tougher sanctions against activities which 
they say do not exist or are not widespread. The louder their protests against stronger 
penalties, the more it suggests questionable practices. The offence is only committed 
when there is deliberate or reckless disclosure of personal data without the consent 
of the organisation which holds it. The implication of their case is that they wish to be 
able to break the law...
This is a pernicious, and largely hidden, illegal market and I am determined to stop it.”

4.14  Mr Thomas met the Prime Minister on 5 March 2008 to discuss the proposed withdrawal 
of clause 75. Mr Thomas’s notes of the meeting record that the Prime Minister “accepted 
that a strong sentence is needed to deter all those involved”, but “at the same time, he is 
concerned  to  strike  the  right  balance  with  protecting  freedom  of  the  press,  especially  in 
relation to legitimate investigative journalism. Now that some time has been bought (between 
Committee and Report stages in the Lords) he wants a compromise position to be achieved to 
minimise media concerns.”156

4.15  The compromise which was in the end achieved saw the replacement of clause 75 with two 
provisions, each of which required secondary legislation to be activated: the first providing 
an additional defence to the offence in s55 of the DPA as to subjective belief in the journalism 
in  question  being  in  the  public  interest;  and  the  second  providing  for  an  increase  in  the 
maximum penalties under s55 to terms of imprisonment in line with the original proposals, 
but  only after consultation.  These provisions  were enacted in  the form of ss77 and  78 of 
the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and, as has already been noted, the relevant 
secondary legislation has not as yet been introduced.

4.16  The Government’s official position therefore changed radically during this period. It is clear 
that pressure from the press as a whole was brought to bear, but cause and effect is not 
necessarily established by narrating the relevant sequence of events. The influence of press 
lobbying,  and  the  Government’s  reasons  for  their  change  of  policy,  therefore  fall  to  be 
examined.

Evidence of lobbying behind the scenes: reasons for the policy 
change

4.17  Not merely did representatives of the press makes strong public representations against the 
introduction of a custodial sentence, but a number of significant meetings took place behind 
the scenes. The issue was clearly one which the press had taken to heart, and the nature of 
the relationship of a number of key players with politicians was such that ready access was 
available.

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I4.18  The Prime Minister, Mr Brown, dined with Les Hinton, Murdoch MacLennan and Paul Dacre 
on 10 September 2007. Mr Hinton, then Executive Chairman of News International, did not 
give evidence to the Inquiry. Mr MacLennan gave evidence on 10 January 2012 but was not 
asked to deal with this occasion. The accounts I received from Mr Brown and Mr Dacre are 
different in emphasis if not in substance. Mr Brown’s account of the dinner was as follows:157

“A.  I remember the issue. I told them, as we started the dinner, what my own view 
was. I didn’t ask them for their view, I’m afraid. Maybe I should have. I told them what 
my view was, that there should be a public interest defence, and therefore it wasn’t a 
question of them lobbying me. I was informing them that this was my view, but that 
Michael Wills, who was an excellent minister, and Jack Straw, who was doing a great 
job  on  this,  were  consulting  people  about  how  we  could  implement  this  in  a  way 
where there was a public interest defence but we weren’t going to back off entirely 
the potential need for legislation.
Q.  Mr Dacre’s account doesn’t quite match that, Mr Brown. Under tab 34, he gave a 
speech to the Society of Editors conference on 9 November 2008. So it’s about 16, 17 
months after the relevant date.
A.  Yes.
Q.  He says:
“About  18  months  ago  [he  means  on  10  September  2007]  I,  Les  Hinton  of  News 
International and Murdoch McLellan [sic] of the Telegraph, had dinner with the Prime 
Minister Gordon Brown. On the agenda was our deep concern that the newspaper 
industry was facing a number of very serious threats to its freedoms.”
Then he said:
“The fourth issue we raised with Gordon Brown was a truly frightening amendment 
to the Data Protection Act.”
This is the amendment –
A.  I don’t think there’s any disagreement in these accounts. He had it on his agenda 
for the meeting. They raised it, but I told them as they raised it: “Look, this is my 
view.” I didn’t say, “I’m waiting to hear your view”; I told them: “This is my view.” 
I remember this distinctly. I had already made up my mind before I went into the 
meeting, and I told Jack and Michael that there should be a public interest defence 
and that we should probably postpone the implementation of this clause. Look, at 
that time, of course, we didn’t have all the information we now have about the abuse 
of this – of data by the media. At that time, there was no suggestion that there was 
anything other than what was called the rogue hacker. But again, my instinct is still 
the same, that there ought to be a public interest defence. I know it’s uncomfortable, 
because you are balancing off two freedoms, as we said at the beginning. You have 
this right that I would defend for people to have privacy, and you have this right of 
the media, I would say the individual, to express themselves and for the media to do 
this through a freedom of speech and therefore a willingness or ability to investigate 
things that are wrong, and you are balancing off these two freedoms. It seemed to 
me that we may end up with the custodial sentences, and that was an option that 
was left to us. We said we’d come back to this, but at that time we thought that – let 
us look at whether a public interest defence can be introduced into this legislation, 
which is what we did.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.19  During the course of his oral evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Dacre touched on his lecture to the 
Society of Editors in 2008 but was not asked to address in detail the exact circumstances in 
which the DPA issued was raised and discussed on this occasion; there was evidently not 
thought to be an issue about it at that time. His understanding was that Mr Brown was hugely 
sympathetic to the industry’s case and promised to do what he could to help.158

4.20  Mr  Brown’s  recollection  was  that  the  initiative  came  from  him,  rather  than  that  he  was 
responding to press influence or pressure. Mr Dacre’s was more along the lines that he and 
his press colleagues had proved to be persuasive.

4.21  A few questions perhaps arise. First, if Mr Brown was as sympathetic to the press case as Mr 
Dacre claimed, why was the Government were still pressing ahead with a Bill introducing a 
custodial sentence without a revised public interest defence as late as 27 November 2007? 
Secondly, Mr Brown’s testimony did not touch on the issue of the custodial sentence which 
was, after all, at the centre of the press concerns; he referred instead to the need for a public 
interest defence. This overlooks the fact that s55 of the DPA in its un-amended form already 
contained such a defence, admittedly one cast in objective form.

4.22  Lastly, Mr Brown’s assertion that, in September 2007, his knowledge as to the extent of data 
abuse was somewhat limited (“we didn’t have all the information we now have about the 
abuse of this – of data by the media. At that time, there was no suggestion that there was 
anything other than what was called the rogue hacker”)159 may be a mis-recollection of the 
background events that triggered the move to amend the legislation. The contents of the 
ICO’s two reports were the reason for Parliament debating amendments to the statute in 
the first place: there was no doubting what they said. The ‘rogue hacker’ issue was relevant 
to  the  standing  of  the  press  and  the  extent  to  which  journalists  were  likely  to  break  the 
law but it had no bearing on the Motorman case: there was no question of increasing the 
penalty for offences under RIPA and both Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire had, in fact, 
been sentenced to terms of imprisonment.

4.23  Accordingly,  the  impact  of  the  private  dinner  of  10  September  2007  on  the  evolution  of 
Government  policy  at  this  time  is  difficult  to  tell.  Mr  Dacre  clearly  believed  that  it  made 
a  difference;  an  examination  of  the  chronology  suggests  that  official  Government  policy 
remained unchanged.

4.24  Responsibility  for  the  policy  and  the  navigation  of  the  legislative  amendments  through 
Parliament lay with Mr Straw as Secretary of State for Justice. As has been pointed out, and 
as was scarcely unusual, Mr Straw was also subject to behind-the-scenes lobbying by senior 
members of the press, including Mr MacLennan, Mrs Brooks, Guy Black and Mr Dacre, the 
latter of whom Mr Straw had known from their university days and with whom he enjoyed a 
‘respectful’ relationship.160

4.25  Mr Straw’s written evidence recorded that as a result of the representations made by the press 
(which included those received at a meeting that he had with Mr Dacre, Mr MacLennan and 
Mrs Brooks), and despite the Government’s commitment to bringing in custodial sentences, 
he  proposed  to  ministerial  colleagues  that  the  relevant  clause  should  be  withdrawn  from 
the Bill to enable all parties to work out a compromise.161 Interestingly, at no stage during his 
written or oral testimony did Mr Straw indicate that he had had any conversation with the 
Prime Minister which referenced the latter’s preference for a public interest defence.

1275

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I4.26 

In oral evidence, Mr Straw explained why the Government’s position changed. Having referred 
to meetings he had had with various parties, Mr Straw was asked:162

“Q:  If we can look at the text of the letter dated 12 February 2008, you write to Mr. 
Dacre. Under the heading “Data Protection Act”, you say:
“We’re not proposing to criminalise any conduct which is currently against the law. 
However,  we  do  understand  your  and  the  media’s  concerns  more  generally  about 
the introduction of custodial sentences for breach of section 55. We have no wish to 
curtail legitimate and responsible journalism, and when the proposed penalties were 
designed it was not considered that they would have that effect. We’re not aware 
that section 55 has caused any problems such as a chilling effect since the DPA came 
into force. The penalties were proposed and strongly argued for by the Information 
Commissioner to strengthen the protection of individuals’ rights to respect for their 
privacy... But I have reviewed your proposals in light of the important points which 
you and others have made. As I explained when we met, I was increasingly minded 
to consider inclusion of provision for the reasonable belief of someone at the time 
an offence was committed. I understand that there will still be considerable anxiety 
about  the  potential  impact  of  this  measure  and  that  there  is,  therefore  a  case  of 
reconsidering it in slower time.”
Then you say
“Alongside this, I am faced with the overwhelming need to achieve royal assent for 
the bill by 8 May 2008, when the existing legal restrictions against prison officers 
taking industrial action otherwise terminate. Taking all these factors into account, I’m 
making a further recommendation to colleagues and I will be back in touch”.
So you’re faced here, Mr. Straw, with a double pincer movement. On the one hand, 
you have the press stirring up trouble, making the arguments you’d expect them to 
make, and we can analyse those in a moment, and you would say, perhaps even more 
importantly, you had to get the bill through by a particular date because there were 
other provisions in it which were absolutely vital. Is that it?
A:  Yes... I’m afraid that other issues then became subordinate to it. That’s life, that’s 
politics.
...
Q:  Mr. Straw, we understand this is, as it were, a classic case study in realpolitik. 
Royal Assent had to be obtained by a certain date for reasons extraneous really to the 
merits of section 55. Had it not been for that consideration and/or the pressure you 
were under by the press, would your policy position have been either adhere to the 
original position, in other words just up the sentence to include a custodial penalty, 
or were you in fact persuaded by the merits of the argument that the subjective/
objective test should be introduced?
A:  .... I’d like to say that even in slower time I would have made the same judgment 
about the subjective defence that was inserted, but I can’t say for certain ... I am 
absolutely clear that the two went together, and I mean I regret the fact that that I 
didn’t bring in the amendment to section 55 before the election, and I think it ought 
to have been brought in by now, but there we are”

Morning-Hearing-16-May-2012.pdf 

1276

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.27  The  immediate  cause  of  the  compromise,  which  ultimately  was  fashioned  in  the  form  of 
ss77 and 78 of the 2008 Act, was the political reality of the need to enact the whole statute 
before 8 May 2008, in the face of a threat of industrial action by prison officers. Mr Straw 
in particular formed the political judgment that this could only be achieved by compromise, 
notwithstanding  that  this  had,  at  least,  the  appearance  of  yielding  to  pressure.  Although 
the Government had a sufficient majority in the House of Commons to force through this 
legislation in its original form, it had never had a majority in the House of Lords, and there 
clearly was a risk that the Peers might decide to block or delay the Bill on this very point.163 By 
then, the press had very publicly made it an issue, which was no doubt part of their overall 
strategy.

4.28  Mr Straw was also asked to explain whether he had been persuaded by the logic and overall 
merits  of  the  press  case,  or  whether  political  imperatives  predominated.  Understandably, 
and very frankly, Mr Straw found that a difficult question to answer given the difficulty in 
disentangling cause from effect: as he put it, “because I became persuaded, if you follow me, 
so you have to work out why you were persuaded...”.164

Reflections

4.29  The evidence leaves no room for doubt that the press brought its full resources and influence 
to bear on an issue about which it clearly felt very strongly. In that respect, it was acting no 
differently from any other interested party with political influence in relation to proposed 
policy  or  legislative  changes.  Their  case  was  highly  stated,  and  to  a  degree  they  had  the 
Government over a barrel on timing. The merits of the argument are dealt with in detail in 
Part H.

4.30  The dinner engagement of 10 September 2007 must have made it clear to Mr Brown just 
how seriously the press was prepared to campaign on this issue, and one way or another he 
made it clear to his interlocutors that he might be prepared to move on aspects of the policy. 
Having said that, the DPA amendments was only the fourth item on Mr Dacre’s agenda and, 
as has already been pointed out, the Government adhered in the short term to its policy.

4.31  But Mr Brown would have been aware of how high the stakes had become, and that if the 
passage of the amendments through Parliament became problematic, for any reason, then 
he was taking a significant political risk. These risks became more acute in January 2008 as 
pressure mounted, press lobbying intensified and deadlines loomed. Furthermore, there was 
at least some presentational attraction in the argument that the increase in the sentencing 
options should be matched by a broadening of the scope of the public interest defence.

4.32  However,  if  anxiety  about  the  passage  of  the  Bill  prior  to  8  May  2008  might  explain  the 
compromise at that time, it does not explain why in the two years that followed the passage 
of  the  legislation  until  the  general  election,  the  legislation  was  not,  in  fact,  commenced. 
Nobody  has  suggested  that  the  policy  had  changed  because  something  had  happened  to 
cause  the  Government  to  consider  that  the  legislation  had  been  misconceived.  A  more 
plausible explanation may be that the impetus that had been provided by the What Price 
Privacy? reports had been lost and, for understandable reasons, the fast approaching general 
election meant that a further battle with the press over implementation was the last thing 
that the Government wanted.

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I4.33 

I am not in a position to reach a decision as to the reasons why, four years on, legislation that 
Parliament saw it fit to enact has still not been commenced. Its commencement is now said 
to be dependent on the recommendations that I make notwithstanding that the focus of the 
ICO is not on journalists but others who commit egregious breaches of the data protection 
legislation.

5.	 Communications	Act	2003

5.1 

5.2 

5.3 

Introduction
The Communications Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) represented a major and controversial landmark 
in New Labour’s media policy. Its main features in relation to plurality and media ownership 
have  already  been  outlined  earlier  in  this  Report.165  The  Act  had  a  protracted  legislative 
history  covering  a  wide  array  of  media  issues.  This  sub-section  of  the  Report  focuses  on 
the  genesis  of  those  parts  of  the  Act  which  relate  to  newspaper  ownership,  particularly 
foreign ownership, and cross media ownership involving national newspapers and terrestrial 
television. So far as terrestrial television is concerned, for reasons which will become clear, 
the focus is on Channel 5. In particular, this sub-section seeks to examine the relationship 
between politicians and the national press as it relates to the legislative process.

Legislation was considered and in due course enacted in the context of a rapidly changing 
media  landscape.  Digital  media  and  satellite  television,  in  particular,  were  both  growing 
prodigiously. At the start of the story, the position was that (save for EU and EEA countries) 
foreign ownership of, inter alia, analogue terrestrial television was prohibited.166 Moreover, 
cross media ownership was the subject of quantitative limits including a rule which stipulated 
that  no  proprietor  of  a  national  newspaper  could  be  a  participant  with  more  than  a  20% 
interest in a body corporate which was the holder of a licence to provide a Channel 3 service, 
or Channel 5, or a national radio service.167 Consequently, Rupert Murdoch, could not have 
acquired Channel 5, had it been for sale, on not just one but two separate regulatory grounds: 
the ban on foreign ownership and the 20:20 rule.

By the time that the 2003 Act became law, the position on both fronts had been reversed. 
There was no ban on foreign ownership and the 20:20 rule, insofar as it applied to Channel 5, 
had been dropped. It is true that a public interest plurality test had been inserted which would 
have had to be applied to any bid by Mr Murdoch for Channel 5 but that was only as the result 
of determined campaigning against the Government by Lord Puttnam. The regulatory door 
had been opened, by the Labour Government, for Mr Murdoch, amongst others, to bid for 
the terrestrial channel, if it came up for sale. How did the change come about? Is there any 
merit in the suggestion (made at the time) that there was a ‘deal’, between Mr Murdoch and 
the then Labour Government?168 What influence, if any, did the media have on this policy? 
These are the issues to be explored.

5.4  Many of the arguments deployed by diverse interests during the course of the consultations 
and debates which took place remain pertinent to the question of media plurality today but 
are not fully explored here. Current and future plurality issues are considered later in the 
Report.169

5.6 

The Legislative Process
The  development  of  policy  on  media  ownership  and  the  resulting  legislation  which  gave 
life to the policy, rested jointly with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) 
and the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI). The Secretary of State for Culture, Media 
and Sport was initially Chris Smith, now Lord Smith, and, later, Tessa Jowell. Stephen Byers, 
and later Patricia Hewitt, were their counterparts at the DTI. Tony Blair was consulted at key 
stages and was involved in the decision making on a number of issues as to the direction of 
the legislation.

Striking  features  of  the  legislative  process  were  both  the  length  of  time  it  took  and  the 
extensive consultation, scrutiny and debate which occurred, each indicators of the importance 
and  sensitivity  of  the  subject  matter.  A  Communications  White  Paper  A  New  Future  for 
Communications Cm 5010 (the White Paper) was published in December 2000 by Lord Smith 
and Stephen Byers but the Act did not receive Royal Assent until 17 July 2003. In between 
there were extensive consultations, a draft bill published in May 2002, pre-legislative scrutiny 
by  a  Joint  Committee  (described  by  Ms  Jowell  as  a  relatively  unusual  process),  as  well  as 
considerable debate in both Houses, notably consideration of a number of amendments by 
the House of Lords.170

5.7 

Of some significance is the fact that Ms Jowell felt it necessary, shortly after her appointment 
as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, to ask Mr Blair in terms whether or not 
he had reached a ‘deal’ with Mr Murdoch on the reform of cross media ownership rules. It 
demonstrates that even within the Cabinet there was suspicion that an arrangement might 
have been reached:171

“Q.  Can  I  start  by  asking  you  whether  you  had  any  conversations  with  the  prime 
minister of the time when you took up the portfolio?
A.  Yes, I did. From memory, it was, I think, the day after or within a couple of days of 
being appointed, once I had had time to assess what the priorities were for me as an 
incoming Secretary of State, what was in the in-tray.
...
I saw the Prime Minister, as I say, within a couple of days of my appointment, and I 
had a conversation with him which was, I think, necessary, and I asked him whether 
or not any deal had been done with Rupert Murdoch on the reform of the cross-media 
ownership rules. He gave me an absolute assurance, which I completely accepted, that 
there had been no prior agreement, so that it – to a great extent, I had no constraints 
on the conclusions I might reach...”

5.8  Mr Blair confirmed Ms Jowell’s account of the conversation and that there was no implied 
deal with Mr Murdoch. He was not surprised by his Minister’s question, a fact which says 
something  at  least  about  contemporary  perceptions  about  the  relationship  between  Mr 
Murdoch and Mr Blair:172

“Q.  Were you surprised that she asked you that question?

1279

Chapter 5 | Media Policy IA.  Not particularly, I mean, you know, we’re talking 2002, are we, around about? 
Yeah. By then, this issue to do with me and Rupert Murdoch and so on, so it didn’t 
surprise me that she asked that question.”

5.9 

Throughout  there  was  a  good  deal  of  lobbying  by  interested  parties.  Amongst  the  many 
lobbyists  were  News  International  and  BSkyB.  Views  were  received  through  written 
submissions, formal meetings, if requested, correspondence and participation in conferences 
and seminars.173 News International contended that competition law was all that was required 
adequately to regulate the industry:174

“They want all restrictions on foreign ownership removed and would prefer media 
markets to be regulated solely through competition legislation, which they felt could 
be further improved by the removal of the special newspaper regime that currently 
exists.”

5.10  News International was not alone in their view. All broadcasters, except Channel 4, maintained 
that there should be no restriction on ITV/Channel 5 joint ownership save for competition 
law.175 Bloomberg LP forcefully pressed the case for the removal of the foreign ownership 
rules,176  as  did  Telewest.  DMGT  complained,  via  a  letter  to  Charles  Clarke,  then  Minister 
Without Portfolio and Party Chairman, about the competitive disadvantage which it felt arose 
from the domestic regulatory regime:177

“The fact is that foreign media companies are able to use the more relaxed regulatory 
climate  of  their  home  countries  to  build  the  kind  of  powerful  domestic  base  that 
enable them, through acquisition, to become major global players. The irony is that 
these foreign firms are then able to acquire major British media companies that are 
denied to the Daily Mail & General Trust – an all British company – because of this 
country’s regulatory climate”.

It contended:

“For  the  future, DMGT  wants  clear,  consistent  rules  and  an  open  and  transparent 
regulatory environment...”

Policy objectives

5.11  The  policy  objective  was  to:  “preserve  plurality  of  media  ownership  while  not  placing 
unnecessary and unreasonable restrictions on growth and the workings of the market.”178 The 
key principles were described as being: ensuring universal access to a choice of high quality 
services; deregulation to promote competitiveness and investment; self-regulation wherever 
appropriate, backed by tough measures to protect plurality and diversity; and ensuring that 
public service principles remain at the heart of British broadcasting.179

1280

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.12  A  briefing  note  from  the  period  succinctly  sets  out  the  then  Government’s  thinking  on 

democracy, plurality and diversity:180

“Our  democracy  and  our  cultural  vitality  depend  on  the  availability  of  a  range  of 
different media voices, views and styles. The ownership of our newspapers, television 
and  radio  is  therefore  of  the  utmost  importance.  That  is  why  the  Government  is 
concerned  to  ensure  that  citizens  can  receive  a  diversity  of  media  content  from  a 
plurality of sources.
“Diversity is about having a wide range of content and in the White Paper, a New Future 
for Communications, we set out the commitments to public service broadcasting and 
positive content regulation that we believe will be sufficient to ensure this diversity.
“Plurality is not about content but the source of that content, the “voice” behind it – 
the owner. A plurality of voices should:

–  ensure no individual has excessive control over the democratic process;

–  provide a plurality  of sources of news and editorial  opinion,  preserving  the 

culture of dissent and argument on which our democracy rests;

–  prevent the emergence of any one source able to control the news agenda by 

the inclusion / omission of particular stories;

–  maintain  our  cultural  vitality  by  ensuring  that  different  companies  exist  to 
produce different styles of programming and publishing, each with a different 
look and feel.

“We therefore need regulation that is specifically directed to ensure plurality and that 
is why we have imposed rules on media ownership”.

5.13  The evidence discussed in more detail below is consistent with the pursuit of these policy 
objectives throughout, although there was considerable debate about the best kind of rule to 
apply and the precise formulation thereof so as adequately to protect plurality whilst at the 
same time minimising the impact upon economic growth and the market.

Foreign ownership of terrestrial television

5.14  At  the  start  of  the  legislative  exercise  the  Government’s  position  was  that  the  existing 
prohibitions on foreign (non EU/EEA) ownership of, inter alia, analogue terrestrial television 
should be maintained. The purpose of this prohibition, as expressed in the Communications 
White Paper, was to help ensure that European consumers continued to receive high quality 
European content. It was further felt that “without reciprocal reforms in countries like the 
US or Australia that put restrictions on British companies, we cannot justify lifting our ban 
at the present time”.181 However, the downside to the rule was that it excluded investment 
from many countries, notably a number of countries with developed economies, and vibrant 
media industries, including the United States, Australia and Japan. As Ms Jowell explained:182

1281

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I“So the very important and balanced judgment that we had to make was the extent 
that we could open up the possibility of American investment, Japanese investment, 
Australian investment in our British media without prejudicing the quality and without 
jeopardising plurality.”

5.15  News International lost no time and lobbied energetically on the issue from an early stage. It 
took issue with the status quo in its formal response to the White Paper.183 Les Hinton wrote 
to Ms Jowell and Kim Howells (then the newly appointed Parliamentary Undersecretary of 
State at DCMS) in June 2001 to congratulate them upon their appointments and sought a 
meeting. He met Mr Howells on 26 July 2001, following up first with a brief letter the same 
day in which he wrote: “I am particularly delighted to hear that, contrary to the White paper, 
the Government is prepared to consult on the foreign ownership prohibitions”184 and then 
with a longer letter dated 8 August 2001 fully articulating News International’s position on 
this  issue  and  on  cross  media  ownership.185  The  letter  contained  a  thinly  veiled  threat  to 
litigate  relying  upon  Article  10  of  the  ECHR  (freedom  of  expression),  read  with  Article  14 
(prohibiting discrimination) and concluded:

“Foreign ownership prohibitions are unnecessary, anachronistic and discriminatory. 
Furthermore, they are an insult to those foreigners such as Roy Thomson and Max 
Beaverbrook, whose contributions made Fleet Street what it was – not to say to those 
foreigners who are currently active in this industry.”

5.16  The Government initially was not persuaded. As the consultation document was launched Ms 

Jowell briefed the Prime Minister in November 2001 in the following terms:186

“Foreign ownership of broadcasting: our working assumption is that we stick to the 
line in the White Paper that there will be no lifting of foreign ownership restrictions. 
We invite views on whether we should develop reciprocal arrangements with those 
countries which might lift restrictions on UK companies, or put this issue on the table 
for WTO discussion.”

5.17  The documentary evidence shows that arrangements had been made for both Ms Jowell and 
Patricia Hewitt to meet Mr Hinton on 26 November, although the indications are that that 
meeting was subsequently postponed.187 Ms Jowell was again due to meet Mr Hinton on 23 
January 2002, although it is unclear whether this meeting in fact went ahead.188 There was no 
documentary record of such a meeting having taken place amongst the DCMS’ disclosure and 
so the meeting may not in fact have gone ahead.

5.18  The  first  sign  of  a  shift  in  the  Government’s  position  on  foreign  ownership  appears  in  an 
internal briefing document prepared for Ms Jowell on 30 January 2002, following consideration 
of responses to the formal consultation process, which had been launched in November of 
the previous year. On the issue of foreign ownership an official recommended removing the 
existing restrictions on foreign ownership. The recommendation was founded in an analysis

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIof the consultation responses and fully reasoned. The author of the document noted that all 
the major British companies (TV and radio) had argued for reciprocity. Foreign companies 
(News  International,  Bloomberg,  Telewest)  had  called  for  the  restrictions  to  be  removed. 
Some  independent  voices  had  argued  for  the  retention  or  strengthening  of  the  rules  to 
maintain levels of high quality European content. Six considerations were set out in support 
of the recommendation:189

“1. Tier  1  and  2  requirements  will  guarantee  original  production,  independent 
production and UK regional production and programming. Non-EEA companies 
could bring welcome inward investment.

“2. There  is  arguably  no  difference  in  principle  between  French  or  German 
ownership, which we currently allow, and US or Australian ownership which 
we ban. To remove the ban is to remove an anomaly. Other European countries 
(eg Germany, Spain, the Netherlands) have removed foreign ownership rules 
without any obvious adverse effect.

“3. Foreign owners are already allowed into the newspaper market, where there 

has been no obvious loss of “British” content.

“4. The Radio Authority argue that foreign ownership will dilute the “local” nature 
of services, but there seems no reason why a large US company should have 
any more reason than a large UK company to degrade the service offered in 
any local area.

“5. Foreign ownership can be difficult to identify, eg in the case of Sky, which the 

ITC do not consider to be a foreign-controlled company.

“6. A  position  of  reciprocity  would  in  effect  add  up  to  a  ban  on  American 
companies, given that the US is extremely unlikely to remove their rules on 
foreign ownership in the foreseeable future.”

5.19  Ms Jowell did not accept the recommendations uncritically. An internal minute of 7 February 
2002  evidences  the  fact  that  she  called  for  a  note  from  the  Radio  Authority  on  foreign 
ownership. The official who considered that note did not feel that it provided a strong case 
for maintaining a ban on non-EEA ownership. The internal minute also records preliminary 
legal advice about the strength of the ECHR challenge which had been threatened by News 
International (see 1.14 above) and Bloomberg. The view of the Department’s lawyers was 
that the matter was not clear cut and that the argument advanced against the secretary of 
state would involve an extension of the current law if it were to prevail.190

5.20 

In the result, both Ms Jowell and Ms Hewitt were persuaded that the best course was the 
abolition of the restrictions on foreign ownership and recommended the same to the Prime 
Minister in a joint letter to him about media ownership rules dated 7 March 2002.191 After 
discussion, Mr Blair accepted the recommendation.192 In due course the decision was accepted 
by the Cabinet and incorporated into the Draft Communications Bill which was published on

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I7 May 2002. On the issue of foreign ownership, in the course of her statement about the Bill, 
Ms Jowell told the House:193

“We  also  intend  to  scrap  the  inconsistent  rules  that  prevent  the  non-European 
ownership of some broadcasters. It makes no sense that French, Italian or German 
companies can own television and radio licences, but Canadian, Australian or United 
States companies cannot. The resultant inward investment should allow the UK to 
benefit rapidly from new ideas and technological developments. New blood and new 
competition will help to give our industry the edge.”

5.21 

In her evidence to the Inquiry, Ms Jowell, also explained how the change in policy thinking 
in relation to foreign ownership was interrelated with Ofcom’s emerging content regulation 
role:194

“...we  were  very  concerned  to  avoid  a  situation  where  we  lifted  the  restriction  on 
foreign ownership of terrestrial television in a way that invited dumping of low quality 
content. So the decision on relaxing foreign ownership really moved alongside the 
development of our thinking on the content regulation role of Ofcom..”

5.22  The  history  above  has  been  set  out  at  some  length  because  it  demonstrates  an  entirely 
proper and reasoned approach to a significant policy decision. News International lobbied 
with characteristic determination (something that they would not have needed to do had 
there been a pre-existing deal). The records show that in fact the change of policy on foreign 
ownership occurred as a result of the consideration of responses to a formal consultation 
process. Indeed further views were sought from the Radio Authority, and preliminary legal 
advice taken about whether or not maintenance of the ban on foreign ownership would be 
discriminatory as alleged by News International and Bloomberg, before the Ministers made 
their recommendation to Mr Blair. These are not the actions of persons seeking to advance a 
particular agenda, but those of persons seeking to make an informed decision.

5.23  The reversal of position is consistent with a trend towards incorporating more, rather than 
less, deregulation as the policy developed. Both the removal of the ban on foreign ownership 
and  the  relaxation  of  the  20:20  Rule  in  relation  to  Channel  5  (see  below)  exemplify  this 
trend. The Ministers plainly took account of, and were influenced by, the responses to the 
consultation process. It was the responses of large foreign owned media companies which 
proved more persuasive.

Channel 5

5.24  Consideration of the relaxation of the 20:20 rule in relation to Channel 5 first requires some 
background.  At  the  material  time,  Channel  5  was  not  for  sale.  Nor  had  either  BSkyB,  or 
News Corporation, indicated a firm intention to bid for the channel if it did come onto the 
market. BSkyB was, however, potentially interested as is evidenced by an internal Sky memo, 
obtained by DCMS through an undisclosed means, in which the possibility, amongst others, 
of a bid for Channel 5 is countenanced.195 The memo is striking because it also appears to

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIshow that representatives of BSkyB had previously met James Purnell196 and discussed what 
would happen if BSkyB bid for a Channel 3 licensee:197

“For the record, shortly after Carlton made its bid for UN&M and Granada made its 
bids for both Carlton and UN&M, Irwin and I met with James Purnell. He confirmed 
that the Government would not rely on the 20:20 Rule to block a takeover bid by Sky 
for a Channel 3 licensee (and one would assume that the same approach would apply 
to Channel 5). James anticipated that any such bid by Sky would be referred to the 
Competition Commission (as was the case with bids by the ITV companies for each 
other). Assuming that the Competition Commission did not find such a bid by Sky to 
be against the public interest, the Secretary of State would use the statutory power 
to amend the 20:20 Rule to ensure that it did not block that bid” (emphasis added).

5.25 

It is not necessary to determine whether or not Mr Purnell did in fact say what is attributed 
to him in the note because whatever he did say was overtaken by events when the rule fell to 
be considered at the highest levels of Government as described below.

5.26  After publication of the draft Communications Bill, BSkyB’s potential interest in Channel 5 was 
confirmed by Tony Ball, then chief executive of BSkyB, who told the Guardian that a takeover 
of Channel 5: “could be interesting if the price was right”.198

5.27  Channel 5 was in some difficulty because it had not lived up to financial expectations and 
was rapidly losing money. It was entirely realistic to believe that it might be offered for sale 
to a large media organisation. One of its significant shareholders, United Business Media plc 
(UBM), had expressed the view to Ms Jowell, that its future best lay as a part of a larger media 
organisation and had gone so far as to identify BSkyB amongst others as a potential buyer. 
Lord Hollick, on behalf of UBM, wrote:199

“...As you know we own 36 per cent of Channel 5 which you visited recently. I was 
responsible for persuading the then Government to consider the award of a further 
terrestrial franchise in the early 1990s. At the time I told the Government and the ITC 
that I anticipated that Channel 5 would have a brief and hopefully profitable career, 
as a stand-alone station but would soon become part of a larger broadcasting and 
media enterprise where its small but innovative and different voice would thrive. I 
had three particular options in mind; it should either become ITV 2 (to provide ITV 
with competitive bulk equivalent to the BBC), Sky 5 (where it would merge with Sky 
1 and become the terrestrial arm of Sky), or Cable 1 (where it would become the 
terrestrial arm of the cable companies).
Channel  5  has  indeed  made  a  bright  start  and  its  ratings  have  exceeded  our 
expectations but unfortunately its financial performance has fallen far short of the 
plan and with its fifth birthday approaching it is still losing well over £50 million per 
year. The strategic and economic case for a merger of Channel 5 into a larger media

reduce the administrative and programme acquisition costs it is burdened with by 
operating on a stand-alone basis, is now overwhelming...”(emphasis added)

5.28  Quite properly, Ms Jowell responded to UBM assuring Lord Hollick that his comments would 
be considered closely but being careful to state: “You will appreciate that I cannot discuss the 
detail of our thinking at this stage ...”200

5.29  Channel  5  had  a  very  small  audience  share  and  did  not  enjoy  universal  coverage.201 
Nevertheless, the concern in some quarters was that if it was acquired by News Corporation, 
or BSkyB, then with the benefit of heavy investment it could grow in influence and audience 
share  and  be  used  to  cross-advertise  BSkyB’s  satellite  channels.  The  scenario  was  taken 
seriously  enough  to  have  been  specifically  covered  in  Ms  Jowell  and  Ms  Hewitt’s  briefing 
ahead of their appearance before the Joint Pre-Legislative Scrutiny Committee.202 It is in this 
context that the Government’s modification of the 20:20 rule falls to be considered.

5.30  Despite a general wish to deregulate, the direction initially and jointly taken by Ms Jowell and 
Ms Hewitt in relation to Channel 5 was in favour of maintaining the 20:20 rule. Thus, on this 
point, their joint recommendations to Mr Blair, made by letter dated 7 March 2002, following 
the formal consultation, and in preparation for the publication of the draft Bill, were:203

“Cross  media  ownership  –  removing  most  media-specific  rules,  leaving  it  to 
competition rules to prevent undue dominance; maintaining restrictions on significant 
cross-ownership of newspaper and TV assets;...” (my emphasis)

and were detailed in annex 3 thereto as meaning:204

“A  continuing  restriction  on  large  newspaper  groups  and  subsidiaries  (News 
International and Sky, Trinity Mirror, and possibly Associated Newspapers in the near 
future) owning any significant share of ITV or Channel 5 companies. Other newspaper 
group, with less than 20% of the national market, would now be able to invest in 
terrestrial  TV  without  the  acquisition  having  to  pass  a  public  interest  test.”  (my 
emphasis)

5.31  The change in direction came as a result of discussions, shortly thereafter, with Mr Blair, and 
is evidenced by a discussion paper sent to him by Ms Jowell and Ms Hewitt. It is notable that 
Mr Blair was not seeking to impose a particular solution, rather he was seeking further to 
explore different options. The recommendation specifically to remove all restrictions on the 
ownership of Channel 5 came from the Secretaries of State and not from the Prime Minister:205

“At our meeting this week, you asked for some further discussion of the merits and 
defects  of  the  different  approaches  we  could  take  to  the  rule  preventing  anyone 
owning 20% of both the national newspaper market and a Channel 3 or Channel 5 
service. Our original recommendation was to keep this rule. Three other options are 
discussed in the pages that follow. Of these, we would recommend Option 3, which

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIremoves all restrictions on the ownership of Channel 5, to allow free investment and 
growth in that channel, while protecting the independent voice provided by ITV, by 
far our largest commercial public service broadcaster.”

5.32  Having said that, Ms Jowell, recalled that this exploration of deregulatory options was itself 

the result of Mr Blair encouraging her to go further than she might otherwise have gone:206

“I have no detailed recollection of the conversation at that meeting ten years ago, 
save to say that the Prime Minister’s instincts in relation to this were, I think, more 
deregulatory than mine. He pushed me further than I might have gone myself on 
exploring deregulatory options, but that was a constructive part of the process.”

5.33  As to the recommendation, it was itself carefully reasoned in the discussion paper:207

“OPTION 3 – KEEP A 20% RULE FOR ITV, BUT NOT FOR CHANNEL 5
Possible effect

–  News  Corporation/BSkyB  own  Channel  5;  ITV  companies  (or  perhaps 
eventually a single ITV) separately owned by a separate media giant with no 
British newspaper interests – Bertelsmann, or Disney perhaps.

–  Channel 5 would be free to benefit from all sources of additional investment, 
allowing it to grow over time into a more serious competitor to ITV. ITV will also 
be able to benefit from new sources of investment, as long as that investment 
doesn’t come from the British newspaper industry.

Advantages

–  This  suggestion  would  be  proprietor-neutral  –  it  allows  anyone  to  buy  and 

invest in Channel 5.

– 

ITV would survive as a voice independent of newspapers’ editorial agendas, 
but will still be able to benefit from new sources of investment.

–  There  are  some  obvious  justifications  for  making  a  distinction  between  ITV 

and Channel 5:

C5 doesn’t cover the whole of the UK population, has low viewing figures and 
few public service broadcasting commitments.
ITV has a much more defined public service role, and comprises 15 regional 
licences  that  cover  the  whole  country.  These  regional  licences  are  already 
the focus of a 20% rule, and cannot be joint-owned with more than 20% of a 
region’s press.

–  We could try to protect the independence of Channel 5 by maintaining or even 

strengthening its public service requirements.

Chapter 5 | Media Policy IDrawbacks

–  Although Channel 5 is small in terms of viewing figures and influence now, with 
increased investment it may grow its share of both over the coming years, to 
remove the most obvious distinctions between it and ITV.

POSSIBLE STEPS TO STRENGTHEN REGULATION OF CONTENT
Whichever option we choose, Channel 5 might be owned by a large newspaper group, 
and its audience share may grow. To address any concerns we might have over the 
quality of news and programming, there are some steps we could take to regulate 
content, rather than ownership...”

5.34  There was a further meeting with Mr Blair and it was agreed to remove the restriction against 

sizeable newspaper companies owning Channel 5:208

“We  have  met  twice  to  discuss  the  reform  of  media  ownership  rules.  This  letter 
summarises the decisions we have taken. Our approach will be deregulatory wherever 
possible, but we will retain a set of simple rules to prevent too great a concentration 
of ownership and political influence. Where we propose to remove rules (for example 
to allow sizeable newspaper companies to own Channel 5) content regulation will 
be  able  to  maintain  the  quality,  impartiality  and  diversity  of  programming  and 
competition law will tend to encourage dispersed ownership and new entry...”

5.35  The then Prime Minister’s thinking was obviously influential in this decision, as Ms Jowell 

readily acknowledged:209

“He was in favour of this option and he agreed with me on the safeguards that should 
accompany a decision to pursue this option to lift the ownership bar created by the 
20 per cent on Channel 5”.

and, later:210

“Q.  I’m not for a moment suggesting that this wasn’t a considered decision and that 
these things can happen as policy and legislation develops, but my question was: was 
it the influence of the Prime Minister’s thinking that set you on a course of thinking 
that led to you changing your mind?”
“A.  Well,  of  course,  it  did,  because  he’s  the  Prime  Minister,  and,  you  know,  when 
you develop – you’re a Secretary of State and you’re developing policy and the Prime 
Minister has a slightly different view from the one that you’re advancing, you take 
that seriously.”

5.36  The safeguards referred to in the first of the quotations above concerned content regulation 
and the ability to require that Channel 5 took a nominated news provider in the event that 
the channel grew significantly. Their inclusion indicates that consideration was clearly being 
given to the plurality ramifications of the altered stance on Channel 5:211

of new investment from being a tiny and rather marginal terrestrial company, that 
Ofcom would be in a position to (a) require that they took a nominated news provider 
and  that  they  would  be  in  a  position  to  exercise  the  content  control  that  ITV,  for 
instance, was accountable for–or accountable to–”

5.37 

In the course of denying the existence of any implied deal, Mr Blair confirmed his preference 
for deregulation, explained that he thought that Mr Murdoch was more interested in Channel 
3, and emphasised his wish to encourage very large foreign media companies to enter the 
United Kingdom’s market:212

“Q.  In  terms  of  the  substance  of  the  matter  though,  do  you  feel  that  the 
Communications Act reflected in any way an implied deal with Mr Murdoch or not?
“A.  No, absolutely not. For a start, the thing that we did which was boost Ofcom 
is  a  thing  that  he  absolutely  disliked.  And  contrary  to  what’s  often  written  about 
this, Channel 5 was not his – I mean, I never thought he was (inaudible) Channel 5. 
Channel 3 would have been a far better fit for him, and that he was unable to do. I 
mean, my thing with this Communications Act – because I did talk to the ministers 
about  it  several  times,  my  thing  was  very  much  to  do  with  trying  to  open  up  the 
media ownership thing.
...
“And  I  actually  remember  during  the  course  of  this  piece  of  legislation,  I  actually 
wanted to see if there were major media companies, I mean people the Time Warners 
of this world, Viacom, I think, Axel Springer, other big organisations that if you had 
a more open media policy would be prepared to come in, because what concerned 
me  always  was  that  you  needed  –  it  wasn’t  necessary  just  to  have  other  media 
ownerships, it was necessary to have other media owners with heft, with the ability 
to put major investment in, and frankly with the type of global media position that I 
could see the world moving to.”

5.38  There can be no doubt that the relaxation of the 20% rule was good news for Mr Murdoch, 
and that the decision to relax the rule was personally influenced by Mr Blair. However, it does 
not follow from those bare facts that there was any explicit arrangement to that effect; nor 
even that the latter pushed this point specifically in order to favour News Corp in the hope 
of maintaining its support. The evidence demonstrates a more complex position. There was 
a clear desire to deregulate within the Government, the only differences being as to how 
far  deregulation  should  go.  Mr  Blair  was  ready  to  go  further  than  Ms  Jowell  was  initially 
prepared to go and she in turn was prepared to go further than her predecessor Lord Smith.213 
Ultimately, this was an area in which a balance had to be struck between plurality safeguards 
and market freedom and in which there was considerable room for differing views as to what 
was best for the country.

5.39  The decision was not unqualified good news for Mr Murdoch. As Mr Blair pointed out, the 
2003  Act  contained  much  which  News  Corp  did  not  like,  not  least  insofar  as  it  related  to 
Ofcom. In relation to the 20% rule, the final decision to remove the rule only in relation to 
Channel 5, but not in relation to the more influential Channel 3 did not go anything like as far 
as News Corp had been seeking. Whilst it would be wrong to say that Mr Murdoch had no 
interest in Channel 5, the evidence does not demonstrate that it was a priority.

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I5.40  This  is  an  example  of  media  policy  being  personally  influenced  by  a  prime  minister  and, 
as such, points to the importance of the personal access which many senior media figures 
have had to our Prime Ministers. There may not be a deal, actual or implied, but access to 
communicate one’s views in person to a Prime Minister who can directly influence policy is 
potentially a very important advantage.

5.41 

Lord Puttnam’s amendment and the media plurality test
In relation to acquisitions by national newspaper owners of terrestrial television interests, 
before  the  enactment  of  the  2003  Act,  a  public  interest  test  was  applicable  in  three 
circumstances:214

(c)  Any application by any newspaper owner to hold a licence for GMTV, Channel 5, or any 

national radio service;

(d)  Any application to hold a regional Channel 3 licence or a local radio licence, by any 

national or relevant local newspaper owner; and

(e)  Digital programme services could not be provided for three months after the award of 
the licence to a national or relevant local newspaper owner unless a plurality test was 
met.

5.42  These rules were not  thought to  be helpful  by DCMS  and  DTI.  They initially  consulted on 
the possibility of incorporating an alternative public interest test into cross media ownership 
decisions,  in  terms  which  were  summarised  by  Ms  Jowell,  when  writing  to  Mr  Blair,  as 
follows:215

“...We ask for views on whether the cross media ownership limits should be abolished, 
retained or reformulated. If they are retained in some form, we ask whether they 
should be permeable, with decisions above the threshold of the formula subject to a 
plurality test, and whether such decisions should be taken by the Secretary of State 
or by OFCOM.”

5.43  Government  thinking  was  at  that  stage  concerned  with  whether  to  apply  a  plurality  test 
above a quantitative ownership threshold so as to make the threshold permeable. It was not 
the overarching test that was ultimately adopted following Lord Puttnam’s intervention. Even 
this limited proposal met with disfavour when the responses to the consultation paper had 
been considered. DCMS officials noted that most respondents rejected the idea of a media 
plurality test and recommended against such a test:216

“Plurality tests are not well supported by the industry because they are inherently 
uncertain. Given that we are offering significant deregulatory reforms in most areas, 
and setting rules only where we feel we need to draw a line at what is acceptable in 
terms of plurality, there seems little point in offering additional flexibility where it is 
not wanted.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.44  The  notion  of  some  kind  of  plurality  test  was  nevertheless  explored  further,  and  at  Ms 
Jowell’s request, the idea of expanding the plurality test in the newspaper regime to apply 
to all mergers (including cross-media mergers) that involve newspapers was the subject of a 
detailed ministerial submission prepared for her and Ms Hewitt in February 2002.217 The fact 
that this paper was sought at all tends to suggest that the Ministers had open minds and were 
genuinely seeking to explore the options.

5.45  The joint recommendation which ultimately went from the Secretaries of State to the Prime 
Minister did not propose the inclusion in the draft Bill of a plurality test to be applied to cross 
media acquisitions. On the contrary, it recommended the abolition of the three extant public 
interest tests which applied to the acquisition of other media by a newspaper proprietor (see 
1.41 above):218

“The three existing rules that together make any purchase of any broadcasting service 
by any newspaper proprietor subject to a public interest test will be removed. The 
scope of these tests is not clear; they discourage newspaper owners from attempting 
levels of consolidation that would not necessarily dilute plurality; and they distort 
the  market  by  encouraging  existing  owners  who  wish  to  sell  to  accept  bids  from 
non-newspaper owners who will not have to wait to pass a public interest test (a 
parallel  may  be  drawn  with  the  recent  purchase  of  the  Express  newspapers  by  a 
non-newspaper owner who was not subject to any test under the special newspaper 
regime).”

5.46  Plurality  was  instead  to  be  ensured  by  quantitative  limits  on  cross  media  ownership  and 
competition law. The rules were to be the subject of automatic review by Ofcom no less than 
every three years. Insofar as it relates to national newspapers, their relevant proposals were 
summarised as follows:219

“Cross-media ownership
“The existing patter of rules to be stripped down to those rules we feel are essential:
–  A rule preventing those with more than 20% of the national newspaper market 

buying a significant stake in Channel 3 or Channel 5...

“Other rules to be removed:
Rules that stipulate public interest tests for any acquisition of any broadcasting licence 
by any newspaper company to be scrapped ...
“...
“Review of ownership rules

–  All rules to be subject to automatic review by OFCOM no less than every 3 
years OFCOM to make recommendations to the SofS, who can amend rules by 
secondary legislation.”

5.47  At this stage, on cross media ownership, the large media companies were heading towards 
getting most, but not all, of what they wanted. Within Government there was (and always 
remained) a refusal to accept that competition law alone would suffice to ensure plurality in

Chapter 5 | Media Policy Ithe media. The ministers’ underlying political thinking is well summarised in their joint letter 
to Mr Blair:220

“We believe that the case for deregulation is powerful. There has been an explosion 
of  media  choice  in  recent  years  giving  people  a  wide  range  of  sources  of  news, 
information, entertainment and other services. Meanwhile, the existing rules have 
hampered  some  companies  from  expanding  and  developing  while  others  find 
themselves much freer. These anomalies are not good for investment, jobs or diversity 
of products for the consumer.
However, we also believe that the media are different from other industries, which 
means that Competition law alone is insufficient. They are a uniquely powerful force 
in democracy and debate and there is a long history of some media owners using 
national  newspapers  in  particular  to  promote  their  views.  We  need  a  significant 
degree of plurality of ownership for democracy to work, and competition law can’t 
guarantee this for us. Our line is therefore to regulate ownership on top of competition 
law,  but  only  where  absolutely  necessary  –  imposing  a  simple  set  of  barriers  to 
excessive concentration.
We are therefore proposing substantial deregulation, both within each media sector 
(radio,  TV,  local  newspapers,  and  national  newspapers)  and  also  between  them, 
subject  to  retaining  reduced  but  still  significant  controls  on  cross-ownership  of 
national newspapers and major terrestrial TV channels.”

5.48  A  revealing  part  of  the  joint  submission  made  by  the  Secretaries  of  State  to  the  Prime 
Minister is the annex listing potential commercial winners and losers on the proposals  as 
they then stood. The “Big Winners” are stated to be terrestrial television companies, most 
non-EEA companies, the biggest radio groups and the smaller national newspaper groups. 
News International is not amongst the “Big Winners” but is placed is the “Smaller Winners” 
category  along  with  the  largest  national  newspaper  groups,  their  subsidiaries  and  the 
regional-only newspaper groups.221 It must be noted that this assessment was at that stage 
on the assumption that the prohibition on a News International purchase of Channel 5 would 
remain  and  the  ultimate  outcome  was  more  favourable  for  News  International  than  that 
contemplated at this time. Nevertheless, the assessment tends against any suggestion that 
the Government of the time was seeking specifically to benefit News International and is 
consistent with its policy of deregulation for wider economic and consumer benefit.

5.49  As has been discussed above, the 20% rule, as it applied to Channel 5 was not in the event 
included  in  the  draft  bill,  as  a  result  of  discussions  with  Mr  Blair.  On  the  subject  of  cross 
media  ownership,  the  Secretaries  of  States’  recommendation  to  reduce  the  system  to  its 
essentials was accepted and no media plurality test was incorporated into the draft bill for 
application to cross media acquisitions.222 This approach was consistent with the desire to 
provide predictable rules for business and with the greatly relaxed approach to newspaper 
mergers set out in the draft Bill, the effect of which was summarised as follows:223

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“A  reformed  newspaper  merger  regime  will  be  less  onerous  and  more  targeted, 
applying  post-acquisition  only  in  cases  where  there  is  significant  concern  on 
competition or plurality grounds. Criminal sanctions will be removed. Final decisions, 
at least on plurality grounds, will rest with Ministers.”

5.50  The absence of a plurality test generally applicable to media mergers in the draft bill became 
the subject of some controversy. At the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, the Joint Committee 
made  148  recommendations.224  Amongst  these,  the  Committee  recommended  the 
incorporation of a plurality test for media mergers to be incorporated into the general merger 
regime introduced by the Enterprise Act 2002 (and thus applicable to media mergers which 
were also qualifying mergers for the purposes of that Act). They also expressed concerns 
about the proposed exclusion of Channel 5 from the 20:20 rule and the lifting of the ban 
on  foreign  ownership.225  The  core  recommendation  about  plurality  incorporated  a  widely 
drafted test and read:226

“We recommend that the general merger regime, as introduced by the Enterprise 
Bill, be amended by the Communications Bill to permit the OFT and the Competition 
Commission to have regard to plurality, as well as the issue of substantial lessening 
of  competition,  in  reaching  decisions  on  media  mergers.  For  these  purposes,  we 
recommend  that  plurality  be  specified  as  a  consideration  in  respect  of  which  the 
Secretary of State may serve a public interest intervention notice and that plurality 
be defined as:
The public interest in – (i) the maintenance of a range of broadcast media owners 
and  voices  sufficient  to  satisfy  a  variety  of  tastes  and  interests;  (ii)  the  promotion 
and  maintenance  of  a  plurality  of  TV,  radio  and  other  broadcast  media  owners, 
each of whom demonstrates a commitment to the impartial presentation of news 
and factual broadcast programming; and (ii) the promotion and maintenance, in all 
media including newspapers, of a balanced and accurate presentation of news, the 
free expression of opinion and a clear differentiation between the two”.”

5.51  DCMS and DTI considered the Joint Committee’s recommendations, accepting most of them 
and they also considered the responses of interested parties to the draft Bill. On the question 
of  a media  plurality  test, they were unmoved by the Joint Committee’s  recommendation. 
A contemporary joint briefing produced by officials for Ms Jowell and Ms Hewitt succinctly 
recorded their position:227

“[The Government’s view is that the only way to guarantee sufficient levels of plurality 
on a cross-media basis is to set clear, specific limits on ownership through a number 
of key rules.
“Since  these  rules  –  which  will  apply  to  all  mergers  –  are  directed  at  the  same 
objectives as a general plurality consideration, we do not see the need to provide 
additionally for a general plurality test in the Enterprise Bill merger control regime].”

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I5.52  There were also concerns that the proposed test would effectively impose a form of content 
regulation  on  newspapers.228  The  Communications  Bill,  when  it  was  introduced,  did  not 
include a media plurality test.

5.53  Lord Puttnam was not prepared to let the matter rest and led a campaign for, amongst other 
things, a media plurality test, against the relaxation of the 20:20 rule in relation to Channel 
5, and against the lifting of the ban on foreign ownership. He met Ms Jowell on 11 June 2003 
when the position, on these issues, recorded the plurality test as being to the fore:229

“Lord Puttnam thought a plurality test would resolve his own concerns about foreign 
ownership and Channel 5. He accepted, however, that he couldn’t speak for anyone 
else. The SoS said she would be concerned about a double bind of ownership rules 
plus plurality test, and was not convinced that the industry would buy it, given the 
uncertainty involved. Puttnam said his conversations with industry leaders suggested 
they  were  not  unduly  bothered  by  such  uncertainty.  He  is  not  hung  up  about  the 
precise  wording  –  the  extract  from  the  PCC  Code  is  deliberately  provocative.  SoS 
agreed we’d look at his ideas and discuss with our lawyers.”

5.54  There was some limited counter lobbying from the industry but the political tide was turning 
against the Government.230 As the Bill approached its first day of Lords Report, Ms Jowell 
and Ms Hewitt wrote jointly to Mr Blair, informing him that the Government faced defeat on 
the three issues which this sub-section of the report has focused upon: foreign ownership, 
Channel 5, and a media merger plurality test. They invited him to agree to make a concession 
on  a  plurality  test,  it  having  been  indicated  to  them  both  by  the  Conservatives  and  Lord 
Puttnam that such a move would  win their backing on foreign ownership  and Channel  5. 
The thinking behind recommending the concession reflected the increasingly deregulatory 
course which the policy had taken and was stated to be:231

“Until  now  we  have  resisted  calls  for  a  plurality  test  on  the  basis  that  our  mix  of 
content regulation and core ownership rules should protect plurality. In Parliament, it 
has argued that because the Bill is so deregulatory we should equip ourselves with the 
means of investigating further those rare cases where we have removed ownership 
rules but where some concerns remain. We can see the logic in this, although such a 
concession only makes sense if the wider liberalisation central to the Bill is retained.”

5.55  There then followed a period of internal policy debate about the form which a plurality test 
should  take  and,  including  amongst  other  things  whether  it  should  be  a  narrow  test  or  a 
wide test, accompanied by guidance and applied only exceptionally in practice.232 There was

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIa further discussion between Ms Jowell, some of her officials, and Lord Puttnam on 26 June 
2003 which, on the issue of media ownership, as recorded at the time, had all the hallmarks 
of a negotiation:233

“Andrew McIntosh repeated that at Report stage we would signal our concern about 
plurality in general and our intention to consider Puttnam’s plurality test amendment. 
Puttnam said that would not be enough to satisfy him. He was clear that only the 
exact text of his amendment (as scrutinised by Lord Grabiner) would work for him. 
He also circulated a new, additional amendment that would prevent any removal of 
ownership rules relating to Channel 5 until a plurality test had come into being.
The Secretary of State asked for clarification that if we introduced a plurality test we 
would withdraw his opposition to our proposals on Channel 5 ownership. He agreed 
that if we can reach a common position on plurality he will not push the Channel 5 
amendment – he would take his name off it and would encourage Lord McNally and 
Lord Crickhowell to do the same. He will repeat this offer, making clear its conditional 
nature, at Report.
On foreign ownership, he said he would support the Government. He will take his name 
off the amendment, and will stand up and oppose those who argue for reciprocity.”

5.56 

If this meeting produced the outline of a compromise between the Government and Lord 
Puttnam, it still left a real issue between them as to the scope of the plurality test which 
should be put in place. Internal e-mails between officials recorded their understanding of the 
position bluntly and with an emphasis on the impact for News Corp:234

“TJ had now spoken to Puttnam – he will push his amendment to a Division regardless 
of what we say. He will only accept a plurality test that makes absolutely sure News 
Corp  can’t  buy  Channel  5.  He  will  also  vote  against  us  on  C5,  though  not  foreign 
ownership.”

5.57  No consensus had been reached on the wording of a plurality test before Lord Puttnam’s 
amendment was debated in the House of Lords on 2 July 2003.235 The amendment moved at 
the start of the debate was in these terms:236

“MEDIA PLURALITY PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATION

(1) Section 58 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (c.40) (specific considerations) shall be 

amended as follows.

(2) After subsection (2B) (which is inserted by section 368 of this Act) there shall 

be inserted – “2(C) The public interest in the promotion and maintenance-“
(a) of  a  plurality  of  media  owners  committed  to  a  balanced  and  impartial 

presentation of news and to a balanced presentation of comment, and

(b) of a wide range of voices such as to satisfy a variety of tastes and interests 

is specified in this section.

Chapter 5 | Media Policy I(3)   In subsection (3), after the words “any consideration”, there shall be inserted 

“(other than the consideration specified in subsection (2C))”.”

5.58  Lord  Puttnam  explained  that  the  Joint  Scrutiny  Committee’s  proposed  plurality  test  lay  at 
the heart of its conclusions and recommendations about media ownership. The committee 
regarded it as one of three non-negotiables and the test needed to be: “...sufficient to look 
across  all  media  and  make  determinations  in  the  best  interests  of  the  citizen...”237  On  the 
question of the underlying rationale of the amendment he said:238

“Much  has  been  made  in  the  past  few  weeks  of  the  underlying  rationale  of  the 
amendment. I have heard it referred to as “the Murdoch clause”; it has even been 
described as something that attempts to demonise sections of the media. That is not 
and never has been the case. The Secretary of State was entirely right in insisting that 
the Bill and the amendment were entirely “proprietor neutral”. It is more to do, as I 
see it, with attempting to make our democracy proprietor neutral.”

5.59  He later summarised the aim of his amendment as “...a move towards making the “Berlusconi-
isation” of British democracy an impossibility.239 Lord McIntosh, for the Government, supported 
the principle behind the amendments but expressed concerned about the details:240

“Taken  to  one  possible  logical  conclusion,  the  text  of  the  amendment  could  have 
the effect of stopping broadcasters from being impartial and allowing them to have 
“views and opinions” ...
The amendments would also seem to encourage the introduction of content regulation 
into newspapers ...”

5.60  Lord McIntosh summarised the main points in favour of a plurality test: it would allow for the 
gradual dismantling of media ownership rules over time; it would be flexible enough to cope 
with changed circumstances (in this regard he posited the growth of Channel 5 to approach 
that of Channel 3 in size and reach); and it would allow judgments on media mergers, based 
on the particular circumstances of the case (in contrast to the cliff edge effect of the 20:20 
Rule).241

5.61  Turning to the test to be applied, Lord McIntosh promised that a plurality floor would be 

maintained:242

“It will be for Ministers to determine whether the merger causes sufficient plurality 
concerns for it to be blocked, or for conditions to be attached. Similarly, the test must 
also recognise that there is a minimum level of plurality which must be maintained.”

1296

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.62  Significant limitations on the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would, in practice, 

intervene were signalled:243

“We propose that the power be wide enough to capture all media mergers, including 
cross-media mergers. We would intend as a matter of policy normally to apply the test 
in practice only to those areas where the current rules are being removed completely. 
This means that, usually, the Secretary of State would consider intervening on plurality 
grounds  only  in  the  following  areas:  national  newspapers  with  more  than  20  per 
cent of the market/Channel 5; national newspapers with more than 20 per cent of 
the market/national radio service, Channel 3; Channel 3/national radio; Channel 5/
national radio; and national radio/national radio.” (emphasis added).

5.63  On the delicate question as to the practical effect of the Government’s intended test, Lord 

McIntosh would give no specific guarantee:244

“The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, asked whether this test would “effectively rule out” a 
major national newspaper owning Channel 5. The answer is that the test will ensure 
that the Secretary of State can investigate any merger which threatens plurality. It 
will clearly prevent unacceptable levels of cross-media dominance. But it is inherent in 
the nature of a test that one cannot predict the outcome in advance of any individual 
case. It will be necessary to analyse and consider all the relevant circumstances at the 
time on a case-by-case basis.”

5.64  Guidance was intimated in order to afford industry some degree of certainty and, in particular, 
to set out in more detail those areas whether the test would generally be applied and the 
factors that would be considered. Wider application of the test in “extreme and rare” cases 
was, understandably, not ruled out.245

5.65  These  assurances  proved  sufficient  for  Lord  Puttnam  who  withdrew  his  amendment.246 
Subsequently, the amendment to the Enterprise Act 2002, effected by the Communications 
Act 2003, inserting the media plurality test, was in these terms:247

“Media public interest considerations
“After subsection (2) of section 58 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (considerations specified 
as public interest considerations for the purpose of the main merger regime) there 
shall be inserted –

5.66  Had  it  not  been  for  Lord  Puttnam’s  amendment,  the  deregulatory  effect  of  the  2003  Act 
would have been even more extensive than it was. In particular, there would have been no 
restriction, other than ordinary competition law, to prevent News Corp from acquiring and 
then investing heavily in Channel 5 and thereby becoming an even more powerful media 
presence in the United Kingdom.248

Reflections

5.67  The evidence does not support an inference of an agreement between Mr Murdoch and Mr 
Blair. Not only did Mr Blair flatly deny any such deal but the contemporary papers, discussed 
in  detail  above,  reveal  very  considerable  thought,  genuine  debate  and  reasoned  decision 
making during the development of the policy underpinning the 2003 Act.

5.68  Mr  Blair’s  approach  to  the  2003  Act  was  driven  by  the  views  which  he  expressed  in  his 
evidence (as held at that time – they changed later) including his desire to deregulate and 
to encourage foreign investment in what was a rapidly changing and globalising market. The 
approach was congruent with, but not necessarily a product of, his strategy to foster better 
relations with some sections of the media than his predecessors had enjoyed.

5.69  The amount of consultation and dialogue involved during the development of the policy was 
noteworthy. There was considerable industry lobbying. Some of this was not transparent. 
I make no criticism of those involved; standards of transparency were in keeping with the 
times. Both on its own and when collected with other examples, the significance and value of 
transparency is increasingly obvious.

5.70  The views of large media companies were undoubtedly taken into account but so were those 
of others with contrary views. The evidence has not demonstrated bias or unfair advantage 
resulting  from  media  lobbying.  Insofar  as  media  representations  were  preferred  over 
competing representations the documents show that it was the result of a proper weighing 
of  the  opposing  arguments,  and  consistent  with  the  deregulatory  policies  of  the  decision 
makers.

MEDIA POLICY: THE BSKYB BID

1.	
1.1 

1.2 

1.3 

Introduction
On 15 June 2010 News Corporation (News Corp) announced its bid to acquire those shares in 
British Sky Broadcasting plc (BSkyB) which it did not already own and thus triggered a need 
for the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Rt Hon Vince Cable MP, 
to consider the media plurality test introduced by amendment into the Enterprise Act 2002 
at s58(2C).1 As is well known, Dr Cable’s consideration of the bid became the subject of public 
controversy on 21 December 2010 as a result of comments which he made to undercover 
reporters from the Daily Telegraph about Rupert Murdoch and News International (NI). Those 
comments,  which  gave  at  least  the  appearance  of  bias  against  News  Corp,  prompted  the 
Prime Minister immediately to intervene and transfer responsibility for considering the bid to 
the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP.

The  choice  of  Mr  Hunt  itself  prompted  questions  from  some  quarters  because  he  had 
previously commented in positive terms about the bid and was believed to be well disposed 
towards News Corp.2 The bid returned to the public spotlight in July 2011, after the phone 
hacking scandal had broken in earnest, when an Opposition Day Motion was tabled: “This 
House believes that it is in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corp to withdraw 
their bid for BSkyB”.3 In these very adverse circumstances News Corp withdrew the bid shortly 
before the debate.4

Significant further evidence about the bid, and in particular the relationship between politicians 
and the press in relation to it, came to light during the course of the Inquiry. Exhibit KRM18 
to Mr Murdoch’s witness statement contained 161 pages of email traffic evidencing News 
Corp’s lobbying effort. On their face, these emails appeared to show direct private contact 
between Mr Hunt and News Corp’s then Director of Public Affairs, Europe, Frédéric Michel. 
Mr Michel gave evidence to the effect that, in fact, the overwhelming majority of the contact 
was  with  others  at  the  Department  of  Culture,  Media  and  Sport  (DCMS),  predominantly 
Adam Smith, then a Special Adviser (SpAd) to Mr Hunt. These documents, together with text 
and  telephone  records  which  were  subsequently  sought  by,  and  disclosed  to,  the  Inquiry 
demonstrate a sustained behind the scenes lobbying campaign by News Corp, in support of 
its bid wholly to own BSkyB, which the Inquiry investigated by calling relevant witnesses.

1.4 

The  publication  of  KRM18  by  the  Inquiry  aroused  very  considerable  public  interest  and 
immediately  sparked  a  political  debate.  On  24  April  2012  Mr  Hunt  wrote  to  the  Inquiry 
requesting that his evidence be taken earlier than had been programmed, but the Inquiry 
explained that it needed to hear all relevant testimony bearing on the issues before Mr Hunt 
could fairly and properly provide his own account. The Speaker of the House of Commons 
permitted  urgent  questions  to  be  put  to  the  Prime  Minister  about  Mr  Hunt  on  30  April

I2012. In those circumstances it was necessary for the Inquiry, on more than one occasion, 
to make absolutely clear why it was taking evidence about the bid, its approach and, just as 
importantly, those questions which fell outside its remit. On 23 April 2012 I said:5

“I  understand  the  very  real  public  interest  in  the  issues  that  will  be  ventilated  by 
the evidence. I also recognise the freedom that permits what is said to be discussed 
and the subject of comment in whatever way is thought fit, and I shall approach the 
relationship between the press and politicians from an entirely non-partisan judicial 
perspective, which I have no doubt is the reason that I was given this remit. I would 
hope that this approach will be made clear”.

1.5 

On 10 May 2012 I explained what I would and would not be looking at and why:6

“I will look at the facts surrounding the News Corp bid for the remaining shares of 
BSkyB.  I  will  do  so  in  order  to  investigate  the  culture,  practices  and  ethics  of  the 
relationship  between  the  press  and  the  politicians.  It  was  because  of  the  need  to 
examine the facts fairly that on 25 April I spoke about the need to hear every side of the 
story, and although I had seen requests for other inquiries and other investigations, it 
seemed to me that the better course was to allow this Inquiry to proceed. That may 
cause me to look at the Ministerial Code and its adequacy for the purpose, but I will 
not be making a judgment on whether there has been a breach of it. That is simply 
not my job and I have no intention of going outside the terms of reference that have 
been set for me.
For the avoidance of doubt, I see the significance of the way the bid was handled both 
by the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills and the Secretary of State 
for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport as evidencing manifestations, to return to the 
terms of reference, of the relationships between a media interest and politicians and 
the conduct of each”.

1.6 

The publication of KRM18 led to calls for other inquiries and other investigations. On 25 April 
2012 I expressed the view that it would better to allow the Inquiry to proceed:7

“In due course, we will hear all the relevant evidence from all the relevant witnesses, 
and when I report, I will then make findings that are necessary for me to fulfil the 
terms of reference the Prime Minister has set for me. In the mean time, although I 
have seen requests for other inquiries and other investigations, it seems to me that 
the better course is to allow this Inquiry to proceed. When it is concluded, there will 
doubtless be opportunities for consideration to be given to any further investigation 
that is then considered necessary”.

1.7 

I returned to the subject of other inquiries and investigations on 15 May 2012 in the light of 
significant activity in Parliament arising from the publication of KRM18 during the intervening 
period. I fully recognised on that occasion the sovereignty of Parliament to determine its own 
proceedings, but explained how a Parliamentary investigation of the same events as were 
being investigated by the Inquiry, conducted in advance of, or concurrently with, the Inquiry’s

work risked making it impossible for the Inquiry to investigate this part of the evidence in 
accordance  with  its  duty  of  fairness  pursuant  to  s17(3)  Inquiries  Act  2005.8  In  the  event, 
Members of Parliament decided not to proceed in parallel with the Inquiry, and the Inquiry 
has continued as intended.

This subsection of the Report does not seek to provide a comprehensive history or critique of 
the bid. Rather, it considers the relationship between the national press and politicians during 
the course of the bid and the conduct of each, including the ways in which the relationship 
was conducted.9 It explores the relevant interactions, how the competing parts of the press 
sought to advance their interests, and how the politicians conducted the process of applying 
the cross media public interest plurality test. It seeks to identify the issues of concern which 
arose during the process of applying the statutory test with a view to identifying lessons to 
be learned. These lessons are directly relevant not only to the future conduct of the national 
press and politicians in relation to one another but also to the question as to how best to 
ensure the maintenance of sufficient plurality in the media.

Scrutiny of the bid in this way raises many questions. Perhaps the most important question is 
what role, if any, should politicians play in cross media plurality decisions? Also for consideration 
are: how did the statutory test work? Was it necessary? Does it require alteration or change? 
How and why did the problems with process at both BIS and DCMS occur? What can be done 
to  prevent  a  recurrence  of  such  problems?  Consideration  is  also  given  to  whether  or  not 
there was an explicit arrangement between Mr Murdoch and any Conservative politician in 
relation to the handling or outcome of the bid. It is right though to state at the outset that in 
fact the evidence did not come close to proving any such arrangement.

Context

1.10  Total control of BSkyB “...had long been an aspiration, since the merger with BSB”10 for News 
Corp. At the launch of the bid, News Corp’s interests in the United Kingdom included a 39.1% 
stake in BSkyB and 100% ownership of NI. News Corp also wholly owned HarperCollins, one 
of the top four book publishers in the UK.11 These holdings were but a part of a global media 
business with interests in many parts of the world, including shares in a number of European 
satellite broadcasters. News Corp was already generally regarded, for plurality purposes, as 
having control of BSkyB.12

1.11 

James  Murdoch  explained  why  News  Corp  nevertheless  wished  to  acquire  the  remaining 
shares:13

“...News Corporation wanted to expand its holding in BSkyB in order to simplify the 
operating model of the business, to have fewer, bigger businesses, and to focus on 
cash flow and invest in upstream content and creative industries. It was intended to

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iconsolidate BSkyB with our interests in the other Sky businesses around the world to 
create the first state of the art, global, 21st century, digital pay television business, 
which would have centred in the UK. The proposed deal with driven by considerations 
relating  to  the  way  television  is  made  and  consumed  around  the  world  and  the 
benefits of consolidation. We see competition increasingly on an international scale 
and  our  aim  was  to  combine  our  interests  in  a  number  of  our  Sky  businesses  in 
order to compete more effectively with multinational telecoms companies and large 
technology businesses that have begun to distribute audio-visual programming, and 
enjoy certain benefits of scale and scope that the individual Skys might not.”

1.12  He expanded on the international dimension, demonstrating as he did so, the truly global 

perspective from which media companies of the size of News Corp view the market:14

“The  proposed  transaction  would  have  brought  enormous  benefits  to  industry,  to 
the  Sky  business  and  its  consumers  and  to  the  wider  economy.  We  had  hoped  to 
combine our interests in the Sky businesses in the UK, Italy, Germany, India and New 
Zealand to build a world class company, with its headquarters in the UK, I am aware 
that some people in the UK thought that Sky was too big, but we felt that it would 
be helpful to be bigger in order to compete with other international companies such 
as Google, Apple and large telecoms companies, all of whom are much larger than 
BSkyB and have been investing in the audio-visual business heavily on a global rather 
than national basis.”

1.13  There can be little doubt that the acquisition, if it had gone ahead, would have afforded News 
Corp with a significant commercial opportunity to develop a large integrated multi-platform 
media  company.  The  prospect  certainly  alarmed  competitors  in  both  the  newspaper  and 
television industries who vigorously opposed the bid. They were joined in that endeavour by 
two very active campaigning groups, Avaaz and 38 Degrees.

1.14  Although BSkyB is a satellite television broadcaster, its proposed acquisition was of undoubted 
relevance to the national newspaper industry. It offered the prospect of increased cooperation 
between NI’s titles and BSkyB, both of which would have been wholly owned by News Corp 
had the deal gone ahead. Competitors feared that both subsidiary companies would benefit 
from  economies  of  scale,  might  be  able  to  gain  commercial  advantage  by  bundling  their 
products, and (subject to the rule requiring impartial television news coverage) share each 
other’s content.15

1.15  The  commercial  context  in  which  the  bid  took  place  is  important.  Regulation  of  media 
ownership  must  strike  the  right  balance  between,  on  the  one  hand,  avoiding  the  over 
concentration of media power into too few hands and, on the other, attracting investment 
and promoting innovation in a technologically very dynamic industry.

1.16  The precise timing of the bid was related to some extent to the general election held in May 
2010. News Corp deliberately waited until after the election before launching the bid. James 
Murdoch told the Inquiry that this was to avoid the bid becoming a political football.16 He also 
explained that more broadly the timing of the bid had primarily been influenced by the global

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIfinancial crisis and was determined by the need for News Corp to amass the very substantial 
funds necessary to make a cash offer. A third and final factor was the timing of the BSkyB 
board’s summer meeting:17

“A.  I think it was to wait until the election was completed, regardless of the outcome, 
such that a transaction of this size, some $12 million [sic], didn’t become a political 
football, and that was the goal. But the primary driver for the timing was really (a) 
the affordability of it, being able to do it. We had taken some time to really husband 
our resources carefully. It was contemplated that it would be an all cash offer and that 
took a little while to save up, if you will, after – over a number of years. Also, there 
was a gap because in 2009 you’ll recall, with the financial crisis, with the uncertainty 
around the environment, you know, large scale mergers and acquisitions activity was 
a hard thing to get your head around.
Q.  Yes.
A.  And furthermore, in 2009 – and forgive me, Mr Jay, but it’s important because I 
think I know where you’re going, but every summer the BSkyB board, the independent 
directors,  meet  together  to  talk  through  long-term  strategy  and  the  like,  and  we 
wanted to do it ahead of that, or around that time when the board was all scheduled 
to have a few days together, so it could be done completely and properly with the 
board.”

2.  The plurality test and quasi-judicial procedure

2.1 

The statutory framework
The  proposed  merger  met  the  threshold  for  consideration  by  the  European  Commission 
under the EU Merger Regulation. Consequently, News Corp and BSkyB were required to notify 
the proposed transaction to the European Commission for clearance. Following negotiations 
between the parties, they notified the European Commission at the start of November 2010.18 
Clearance was then forthcoming on 21 December 2010.19

2.2 

Domestically, the first formal decision for the Secretary of State was to consider whether or 
not to exercise his discretion to issue a European Intervention Notice (EIN) under s67(2) of 
the Enterprise Act 2002. The discretion afforded by that statutory provision is as follows:

“The Secretary of State may give a notice to the OFT (in this section “a European 
intervention notice”) if he believes that it is or may be the case that one or more than 
one public interest consideration is relevant to a consideration of the relevant merger 
situation concerned.” (emphasis added)

2.3 

The  public  interest  considerations  which  fell  to  be  considered  in  this  case  were  those 
commonly referred to as the “broadcasting and cross media public interest considerations” 
contained in s58(2C) of the 2002 Act. They are:20

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“(a)  the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a 
particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality 
of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience;
(b)  the  need  for  the  availability  throughout  the  United  Kingdom  of  a  wide  range 
of broadcasting which (taken as a whole) is both of high quality and calculated to 
appeal to a wide variety of tastes and interests; and
(c)  the need for persons carrying on media enterprises, and for those with control 
of such enterprises, to have a genuine commitment to the attainment in relation to 
broadcasting of the standards objectives set out in section 319 of the Communications 
Act 2003.”

2.4 

2.5 

2.6 

When  Dr  Cable  in  due  course  did  decide  to  issue  an  EIN,  the  particular  plurality  concern 
which he identified in the notice was that set out at (a) above.21

The issue of an EIN triggers an obligation upon the OFT to report to the Secretary of State 
and,  as  happened  in  due  course  in  this  case,  media  plurality  is  considered  to  be  a  public 
interest consideration, then Ofcom is also required to prepare a report. Once in receipt of the 
reports it then falls for the Secretary of State to decide whether or not to refer the case to 
the Competition Commission for detailed scrutiny. In the present case this was the decision 
which fell to Mr Hunt, after responsibility for the bid was transferred to him on 21 December 
2010, and it is considered in more detail later in this section of the Report.22

The alternative to issuing an EIN was for the Secretary of State simply to permit the acquisition 
to proceed, subject only to the European Commission’s competition decision. In other words, 
simply to allow the acquisition without further specific scrutiny of the possible consequences 
of the transaction for media plurality.

The guidance
As  promised  by  the  Labour  Government  when  the  media  plurality  test  was  inserted  by 
amendment into the 2002 Act, and as is provided for by s106A of the 2002 Act, guidance 
was published by the then Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in 2004 (the Guidance) 
with a view to explaining the considerations specified in section 58(2A) to (2C) to persons 
who are likely to be affected by them; and indicating how the Secretary of State expected the 
legislation to operate in relation to such considerations. The Guidance, whilst not binding, is 
intended to provide an indication of how the media public interest merger regime will operate 
in practice, and the approach which the Secretary of State is likely to adopt in considering 
cases. The Secretary of State should have regard to the Guidance and should only depart 
from it with good reason. Ultimately, as the Guidance makes clear, each transaction falls to 
be looked at on its merits on a case-by-case basis.23

2.7 

In relation to a decision to intervene on a media public interest consideration, the Guidance 
provides in relation to procedure that:24

1304

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“...If the Secretary of State is going to take a view on whether or not to intervene in the 
case on public interest grounds, the parties to the merger will be informed of this and 
invited to submit any views they have on this in writing. In taking a view on whether 
to intervene the Secretary of State will have regard to all available information which, 
depending on the case, may include:
•  submissions from the parties to the merger (as invited by the Secretary of State);
•  complaints made to the Press Complaints Commission and judgments made;
•  any previous regulatory decisions which include relevant information or judgments;
•  published articles raising matters of relevance; and
•  any third party representations received; but
•  she will not receive advice from OFCOM on whether to intervene (though she may 

receive and/or seek information from them in order to inform her decision).”

and (insofar as is relevant):

“...The Secretary of State will not normally conduct a public consultation on whether she 
should intervene in a case, but will welcome and take account of any representations 
she receives. She may also seek the views of a few interested parties if time permits”.

2.8 

2.9 

The exchange of submissions and the oral presentation of a party’s case (in whatever form) 
are not envisaged in this Guidance and, unless the Secretary of State chooses to go further 
than the Guidance indicates, those making submissions are not afforded, at this stage, the 
opportunity to reply to the arguments made against them.

Guidance about the substantive interpretation of the plurality of persons considered, specified 
at s58(2C)(a), and the provision to which Dr Cable ultimately referred when he did issue an 
EIN, is to be found in chapter 7 of the 2004 Guidance. Amongst other things, it makes clear 
that the plurality of persons test “...is concerned primarily with ensuring that control of media 
enterprises is not overly concentrated in the hands of a limited number of persons...” and that 
“...the Secretary of State considers that sufficient plurality in this context refers to the number 
of persons controlling media enterprises, taking into account as appropriate relative audience 
shares” (emphasis added)25

2.10  Of particular relevance to the bid for BSkyB was the policy on intervention in broadcasting and 
cross-media public interest cases set out in section 8 of the Guidance. This policy considerably 
narrows  in  practice  the  application  of  the  otherwise  widely  worded  public  interest  test 
applicable in broadcasting and cross-media public interest cases:26

“In principle, the Secretary of State may intervene in any relevant or special merger 
situations  involving  media  enterprises,  including  cross  media  mergers,  where  she 
believes  that  the  broadcasting  and  cross-media  public  interest  considerations  are 
relevant.
The  Secretary  of  State’s  policy  is  that,  save  in  exceptional  circumstances,  she  will 
consider intervention only in cases where media ownership rules have been removed 
by the Communications Act 2003. These are: ...
...

25 p32, ibid
26 p37-38, ibid

1305

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid IIn addition, the Secretary of State’s policy is that, save in exceptional circumstances, 
she  will  not  intervene  in  respect  of  mergers  in  areas  where  there  are  no  media 
ownership  restrictions  and  none  were  removed  by  the  Communications  Act  2003 
(e.g. mergers involving satellite and cable television and radio services).
...
In  exceptional  circumstances,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  consider  it  necessary  to 
intervene in mergers in areas where there continue to be media ownership rules or 
where  there  have  never  been  such  rules.  The  Secretary  of  State  will  only  consider 
intervening in such a merger where she believes that it may give rise to serious public 
interest concerns in relation to any of the three considerations. During Parliamentary 
debate of these provisions, Ministers suggested that these might include circumstances 
where a large number of news or educational channels would be coming under single 
control,  or  if  someone  were  to  take  over  all  the  music  channels.  The  Secretary  of 
State may consider intervention if a prospective new entrant to local radio ownership 
has not shown a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards in other media or 
countries. The Secretary of State is not currently aware of any other types of cases 
in which exceptional circumstances might arise. She has also taken the view that an 
adverse  public  interest  finding  by  a  previous  regulatory  authority  into  a  proposed 
merger is not necessarily in itself an exceptional circumstance meriting intervention; 
such cases should be considered in light of the reasons for the adverse finding and 
if the law has been changed to allow the sort of concentration resulting from the 
merger.” (emphasis added)

2.11  The proposed acquisition by News Corp, a company connected with a newspaper proprietor, 
NI, of a satellite television company, BSkyB, was not a case where media ownership restrictions 
either  existed  or  had  been  removed  by  the  2003  Act.  Under  the  policy,  intervention  was 
therefore only appropriate in exceptional circumstances and if the Secretary of State believed 
that the proposed transaction may give rise to serious public interest concerns in relation to 
any of the three public interest considerations. It was not one of the transactions expressly 
envisaged as exceptional at the time when the Guidance was drafted.

2.12  News Corp was not alone at the outset of the bid in thinking that there was a strong case 
for not referring the bid when regard was had to this test. They did not see as exceptional a 
merger which involved the acquisition by it of the remaining shares in a company in which 
it already had a significant stake and exercised considerable control. Opponents of the bid 
differed and argued (insofar as is relevant) that there would in fact be a significant increase in 
control with real consequences for plurality.

Quasi-judicial procedure

2.13  Both  Dr  Cable  and  later  Mr  Hunt  recognised  that  they  were  exercising  a  statutory  power 
in a quasi-judicial capacity. What then are the requirements of a quasi-judicial procedure? 
Counsel for News Corp rightly referred in their helpful closing submissions both to the seminal 
case  of  Council  of  Civil  Service  Unions  v  Minister  for  the  Civil  Service,27  which  is  authority 
for the proposition that the requirement is to act with “procedural propriety”, the precise 
requirements of which may depend upon the specific legislative context in which the decision 
is taken; and then R v Home Secretary ex p Doody28 in which Lord Mustill (with whom the

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIrest of their Lordships agreed) distilled six broad principles of fairness from the authorities at 
p560:

“What does fairness require in the present case? My Lords, I think it unnecessary to 
refer by name or to quote from, any of the often-cited authorities in which the courts 
have explained what is essentially an intuitive judgment. They are far too well known. 
From them, I derive that
(1)  Where an Act of Parliament confers an administrative power there is a presumption 
that it will be exercised in a manner which is fair in all the circumstances.
(2)  The standards of fairness are not immutable. They may change with the passage 
of time, both in the general and in their application to decisions of a particular type.
(3)  The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote identically in every situation. 
What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision, and this is to be 
taken into account in all its aspects.
(4)  An essential feature of the context is the statute which creates the discretion, as 
regard both its language and the shape of the legal and administrative system within 
which the decision is taken.
(5)  Fairness  will  very  often  require  that  a  person  who  may  be  adversely  affected 
by the decision will have an opportunity to make representations on his own behalf 
either before the decision is taken with a view to producing a favourable result; or 
after it is taken, with a view to procuring its modification; or both.
(6)  Since  the  person  affected  usually  cannot  make  worthwhile  representations 
without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often 
require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer.”

2.14  From these broad principles it follows that there is a degree of flexibility as to the precise 
approach adopted by a quasi-judicial decision maker, so long as in the particular circumstances 
of the decision the procedure adopted conforms to the broad principles and the decision is 
free  from  either  actual  or  apparent  bias.  Bias,  whether  actual  or  apparent,  will  taint  and 
usually vitiate a decision. The test for apparent bias is whether a fair-minded and informed 
observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that 
the decision maker was biased: Porter v Magill.29 It is important to recognise the significance 
of the words “a real possibility of bias” because they set the threshold for a finding of apparent 
bias well below a finding that there is, or has been, actual bias.

2.15  The requirement for an independent and impartial tribunal  does not mean that a person 
cannot have a prior opinion on the matter in question, so long as that opinion can be and is 
put aside and is not such as to gives rise the appearance of bias. As Dr Cable put it:30

“Yes. I think the key phrase is that an intervention decision must be taken with an 
independent mind, and I have given illustrations earlier in my political career of having 
encountered quasi-judicial decision-making before. I think with an independent mind 
doesn’t  mean  with  a  blank  mind.  Most  people  in  public  life  have  views,  opinions. 
Probably, if they’re politicians, those opinions and views have been on the record, and 
the requirement on me and people in this position is to set those on one side for the

1307

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Isake of making this decision, to consider representations, the evidence, the facts, and 
decide on that and only on that.”

2.16  An obvious but important feature of the quasi-judicial function which the Secretary of State 
exercises in relation to the regulation of media mergers is that the decision is his alone and is 
not a matter for collective cabinet decision. It is not a political decision.

2.17  Crucially,  the  decision  maker  must  address  the  appropriate  test,  taking  into  account  all 
relevant  evidence  and,  equally  as  important,  ignoring  all  irrelevant  evidence.  Thus,  when 
applying the media plurality test, wider political and economic considerations are irrelevant 
and must be ignored.

2.18 

It is against these requirements that the conduct and consideration of the bid first by Dr Cable 
and then by Mr Hunt, their advisers and officials, fall to be measured.

Precedent and experience

2.19  The  media  plurality  test  had  been  applied  only  once  previously,  in  2006,  when  BSkyB 
had  acquired  shares  in  ITV  plc.31  There  was  therefore  limited  practical  experience  of  its 
application,  no  firmly  established  practice  for  conducting  the  test,  and  the  guidance  had 
barely been tested. There was, though, in the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills 
(BIS), significant experience in quasi-judicial decision making in other contexts and Dr Cable 
himself had had some experience of quasi-judicial decision making, albeit many years before 
when he was a Glasgow city councillor.32

2.20  Another  case,  the  acquisition  of  Channel  5  by  Northern  &  Shell,  was  being  considered  at 
around  the  same  time  as  the  BSkyB  bid.  Dr  Cable  decided  not  to  intervene  in  that  case, 
distinguishing it from the bid for BSkyB:33

“In my view, a less robust case for intervention existed in relation to Channel 5 and 
Northern & Shell. Channel 5 is substantively different to BSkyB in that it is not a source 
of news – the news programmes that are broadcast on Channel 5 are provided by Sky 
News. Channel 5 is not central to news provision in the UK. In addition, Northern & 
Shell newspaper titles (the Daily Star, Daily Express and the Sunday Express) have a 
significantly lower market share – in the region of 10 to 14%, compared to 37% for 
News International titles. On an assumption that there was only a limited prospect 
that Channel 5 would develop the capability to provide news to other broadcasters in a 
similar way to ITN and Sky News, the prospect of a negative impact on plurality turned 
on the extent to which plurality might be damaged by a possible closer alignment 
between news broadcast by Channel 5 and news as covered by the Northern & Shell 
titles.
I considered advice in this matter and decided that, while it was open to me to intervene 
in this case, I should not do so. Bearing in mind the nature of the enterprises involved, 
and taking into account the Guidance, I did not consider this was an exceptional case 
in respect of which intervention on public interest grounds was appropriate. There

number of sources of news available to people in a way that was detrimental to the 
public interest.”

of conducting quasi-judicial decisions in relation to the National Lottery and gambling.34

Initial reaction
News of the bid broke early on 15 June 2010. The Press Association reported it in terms which 
make clear the commercial sensitivity of the regulatory process and which are a reminder 
that this is an area in which a balance has to be struck between regulation and free operation 
of the market:35

“BSkyB said today that it had rebuffed an initial attempt by Rupert Murdoch’s News 
Corp to take full control of the UK satellite broadcaster.
The 700p-a-share approach for the 61% of BSkyB that NewCorp does not currently 
own values the FTSE 100 Index company at around £12 billion.
BSkyB said the proposal significantly undervalued the business and called for an offer 
in excess of 800p a share, in part to compensate shareholders for the wait they would 
face while regulatory clearance was sought...” (emphasis added)

James  Murdoch  immediately  requested  and  was  granted  a  telephone  call  with  Dr  Cable. 
In  his  evidence  Dr  Cable  described  himself  as  having  been  in  listening  mode  during  this 
conversation.36 He denied giving any indication of his views: “I gave no indication of my views 
on the bid one way or another”.37 The short formal minute of the conversation made by his 
officials is consistent with this.38

Dr Cable’s account was disputed by both James Murdoch and Mr Michel. In an internal email, 
Mr Michel quoted Dr Cable as having said that: “there would not be policy issue in this case” 
and opined: “We should have recorded him!”39 James Murdoch addressed the issue in the 
course of answering a broader question about a supportive statement about the bid made by 
Mr Hunt: “...this is one part of the government, saying: “Look, we don’t see any issues here, 
we’ll probably be – it’s going to be fine”, which is consistent with what Mr [sic] Cable had told 
me on the telephone”.40

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I3.4 

It is not necessary to resolve this conflict in the evidence for two reasons. First, whether or 
not Dr Cable expressed a provisional view, he later came to a very different conclusion and he 
did so on the basis of reasons which were both proper and well supported. Second, whatever 
else the remaining evidence about the bid shows, it certainly does not reveal any appearance 
of bias on the part of Dr Cable in favour of News Corp.

3.5 

An internal BIS email suggests that in the conversation on 15 June 2010 Dr Cable had not 
ruled out meeting James Murdoch. His subsequent decisions not to do so were to become a 
source of frustration to News Corp:41

“At the end of the call this week James suggested he and the SoS meet up at some 
point, SoS vaguely agreed. They now want a slot in the diary”.

3.6 

Initially, Dr Cable’s officials considered that it would be unreasonable to refuse a meeting 
although  they  contemplated  that  the  Secretary  of  State  would  once  more  be  in  listening 
mode:42

“It seems reasonable to assume that since the phone call earlier this week, the two 
companies are closer to reaching a deal and that James Murdoch wants to update the 
SofS and, in the light of their experience in the ITV share acquisition case, would want 
an indication from the SofS as to whether he would use his powers of intervention.
It  therefore  would  perhaps  seem  unreasonable  to  refuse  their  request.  The  SofS 
should however, be in listening mode and I would suggest that he should follow the 
lines to take (background would remain the same) as provided in my e mail of late 
Tuesday evening. It might help if a CCP official could sit in.” (emphasis added)

3.7 

Dr Cable decided not to, and the efforts of Mr Michel to secure a meeting for his principal 
were rebuffed:43

“...Also  I  understand  that  Frederic  Michel’s  office  called  my  private  secretary  on  a 
number of occasions to try to arrange a meeting but after considering advice I decided 
to decline any meeting”.

3.8 

Dr Cable explained why:44

“Well, the name Frederic Michel didn’t register on my radar, but I was aware that 
there was a request to have a meeting, and I didn’t wish to be disrespectful to Mr 
Murdoch. I do meet major investors. But in this case I thought there were compelling 
reasons not to meet him. First of all, there was a legal risk because the subject which 
he clearly wished to talk about was something couldn’t talk about, that if I did meet 
him this might be perceived by other parties to be partial in his direction, and I would 
therefore have to see them, and there were lots of them, so potentially very large 
numbers of meetings which, by definition, couldn’t have any substance, and – but 
I  think  the  key  reason  was  I  didn’t  actually  think  it  was  necessary,  because  they 
had an opportunity to, through Hogan Lovells, to put their opinions in writing, their 
submissions. They did so on several occasions.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.9 

Dr Cable had been invited to News Corp’s summer party, due to be held the next day on 16 
June 2010, and had been intending to attend that function. Mr Michel’s email reporting the 
telephone  conversation  between  James  Murdoch  and  Dr  Cable  appears  to  record  that  at 
that stage Dr Cable was still intending to go to the function: “Cable said he was coming as 
planned tomorrow”.45 In the result, because of the bid, Dr Cable decided that it would not be 
appropriate to attend and did not do so.46 Thus, from an early stage Dr Cable decided to avoid 
personal contact with News Corp either directly in connection with the bid or at all. It was 
open to him to decide whether to intervene on the basis of written submissions. He was not 
obliged to give Mr Murdoch an oral hearing. It was also prudent for the decision maker not to 
be seen to be socialising with one party to the bid whilst the decision was pending.

3.10  The first lines to take, worked up by officials for Dr Cable, wisely advised him not to rush to a 
decision: “...recommendation is not to intervene at this stage, or at least until more is known 
and until the merger has been notified to the EC”.47

3.11  Preliminary  advice  on  the  substantive  decision  followed  shortly  thereafter.  Subject  to 
consideration  of  any  arguments  put  forward  to  the  contrary  by  interested  parties,  it 
recommended against intervention:48

“Our initial view is that there is no reason to make a public interest intervention in this 
proposed transaction since it appears to involve no change in practice to the extent 
to which people have access to a wide range of views and opinions. Nevertheless, 
interested parties may put forward a case for intervention and will need to consider 
carefully any arguments that may be put forward on the matter. Accordingly, in any 
public statements BIS makes on the matter, it is important to reserve the Secretary of 
State’s position and not appear to have already reached a conclusive decision”.

3.12 

In coming to this view, officials had spoken about the proposed transaction with colleagues 
at Ofcom, DCMS and the OFT. Both Ofcom and the OFT are recorded initially to have been 
unconcerned  by  the  bid,  contrary  to  their  eventual  positions.  The  officials  at  DCMS  had 
properly identified that the intervention decision was not a matter for them:49

“We have spoken about the transaction with colleagues at Ofcom, DCMS and the OFT. 
Ofcom indicate that while the transaction may give Newscorp increased influence 
over BSkyB’s output , they already treat Newscorp and BSkyB as one entity for the 
purposes of the media ownership rules provided under the Communications Act 2003. 
DCMS officials had no points to make relevant to the decision on whether or not an 
intervention might be appropriate – a decision that falls to be taken solely by the BIS 
Secretary of State. The OFT indicated they did not consider the transaction likely to 
raise substantive competition concerns.”

Submissions to Dr Cable

3.13  There is no statutory duty to consult in relation to a decision on whether to intervene on 
public interest grounds and Dr Cable chose not formally to invite submissions or to meet

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iinterested parties (including News Corp as mentioned above). Nevertheless, he did inform 
people that it was in order to send him substantive submissions.50 Whether as a result of this 
or entirely of their own volition, many people and organisations sought to make their views 
on the question known to the Secretary of State. He did not initiate any exchange of those 
submissions which he did receive.51

3.14  The first such approach came on 23 June 2010 when Brendan Barber, General Secretary of 
the TUC wrote to express “grave concerns” about the bid and sought a meeting to discuss the 
issue: “...I would welcome the opportunity for myself and colleagues representing workers in 
the media industry to meet with you to discuss this urgent matter further...”.52

3.15  A response, which took some time to prepare and went through a number of drafts, was sent 
on 2 August 2010. It explained the decision which the Secretary of State had to make, referred 
to  the  Guidance,  and  invited  the  TUC  to  submit  written  arguments  on  the  matter.53  That 
approach was subsequently followed when responding to numerous others who intimated 
their opposition to the transaction but did not address the specific question which Dr Cable 
had to decide.

3.16  On  20  July  2010  Hogan  Lovells,  solicitors  acting  for  News  Corp,  submitted  an  8-page 
document which it described as a preliminary briefing and which methodically argued against 
intervention.54 Their thinking chimed with that of BIS officials whose reaction is recorded in 
an internal email:55

“The Hogan Lovells analysis accords with our own assessment of the position – which 
is:

(i)  that the transaction appears to make no substantive difference to the state 
of plurality of persons with control of media enterprises since News Corp is 
already deemed to have the power to influence the output of BSkyB and

(ii)  that our published guidance on use of the power to intervene suggests this 
is not a case in which we would expect to use the power to intervene save in 
exceptional circumstances. We remain open to argument on the matter but 
there would  need to  be substantive information  on  which  to  base  different 
conclusions about the case for a public interest intervention”.

3.17  There followed a growing number of submissions against the bid, urging Dr Cable to intervene, 
from media companies and others. On 30 July 2010, Enders Analysis (Enders) produced a 20-
page submission, packed with statistics, which considered the UK TV and newspaper markets, 
and News Corp’s strategy for growth (as seen by Enders), before identifying three specific 
plurality concerns which are set out in full below because the same or very similar points 
were made in many of the other submissions objecting to the bid:56

“First, products currently separately offered by BSkyB and News Corp titles may be 
combined  in  bundles,  discounted  or  provided  without  charge.  For  instance,  BSkyB

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIcould  bundle  News  International  titles  with  monthly  entertainment  to  its  millions 
of  customers  in  the  UK.  If  this  happens,  long-held  reader  loyalty  to  titles  such  as 
The Mirror, The Daily Telegraph and even The Daily Mail could be severely tested. 
In other words, reader loyalty would be measured by a new and entirely different 
yardstick  than  previous  competitor  options,  such  as  temporary  price  discounts  or 
a  new  supplement.  Strategic  initiatives  of  this  nature  could  lead  to  a  much  more 
rapid decline in competitor newspaper circulations than we have assumed, boosting 
News  Corp’s  newspaper  market  share  above  40%  by  2014.  Magazine  publishers 
already know something about this: Sky distributes 7.4 million copies every month 
of its magazine to subscribers of its TV services, making Sky the largest circulation 
magazine in the UK based on ABC data.
Second,  the  widespread  availability  of  fast  broadband  is  encouraging  the  rapid 
convergence of press and television. Today’s newspaper websites contain increasing 
numbers of video clips and extended interviews. Once the News Corp purchase has 
been completed, stories from Sky News (especially video) will presumably be carried 
more and more frequently on News Corp websites. Links to newspaper stories could 
appear at the bottom of the Sky News screen. Progressively, News International papers 
and BSkyB channels, particularly Sky News, may merge into one stream of fact and 
opinion. If this occurred, plurality would decline, even if the combined organisation 
continued to maintain newsrooms that are nominally separate.
Third,  the  loss  of  independent  BSkyB  shareholders  will  allow  News  Corp  greater 
opportunity  to  influence  tacitly  or  otherwise,  the  editorial  coverage  of  Sky  News 
and  other  BSkyB  channels.  The  2006  investigation  by  the  regulators  of  the  BSkyB 
purchase  of  ITV  shares  found  no  evidence  of  proprietor  intervention  in  Sky  News 
under its current shareholding structure, but this could change under full ownership. 
Today, the presence of strong independent directors of the company, many of whom 
have substantial external reputations, helps protect independence and diversity of 
what appears on screen, particularly on news programmes.”

3.18  The Enders submissions arrived on 2 August 2010,57 on the same day as an internal email 
records  that  Dr  Cable  was  questioning  News  Corp’s  submissions  (and  by  implication  the 
views of his own officials) as well as expressing an interest in what others thought about the 
proposed transaction. The document marks the start of a gradual turning of the tide against 
News Corp on the question of intervention:58

“The SoS is of the view that News Corporation’s lawyers can hardly be considered an 
independent source of advice. The SoS has read strongly argued views to the contrary. 
He is somewhat concerned to read that “OFT does not expect the merger to give rise 
to competition concerns”. Does this not suggest that they have prejudged the issue? 
Or have they already carried out an evaluation?”
The SoS has also queried what other representations have been received, Have [sic] 
other media groups written letters? The BBC? Are we expecting representations from 
these and others?”

3.19 

In his evidence to the Inquiry, Dr Cable stated:59

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“...In  the  light  of  the  more  substantive  representations  which  began  to  come  in,  I 
began to believe that there were genuine substantive concerns about the merger and 
that the case for intervention should be explored very thoroughly before reaching 
conclusions on the matter.”

3.20  The internal response of Dr Cable’s officials was to stick to their original view, and point to 
their experience of the plurality test in the only previous case in which the test had been 
applied:60

“...Our  own  analysis  of  these  questions  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  intervention 
appears unlikely to be appropriate in this case – as briefly set out in my original briefing 
note  submitted  on  25  June.  The  Hogan  Lovells  submission  on  behalf  of  Newscorp 
draws much the same conclusions for the same reasons. This is not surprising. We 
all have direct experience of using the powers to intervene in media mergers having 
done so in respect of BSkyB’s acquisition of a 17.9% stake in ITV plc and this heavily 
contested case examined very thoroughly before the courts the limits of the Secretary 
of State’s powers.
...
...On an initial reading, however [the Enders submission] appears unlikely to raise 
points  that  could  lead  us  to  reach  different  conclusions  about  the  merits  of  an 
intervention by the SofS in either of these cases.”

3.21  Guardian Media Group (GMG) also wrote in opposition to the bid on 30 July 2010.61 British 
Telecom (BT) followed on 13 August 2010 with a nine page submission62 and Trinity Mirror 
on 16 August 2010.63 Replies were sent to each of these organisations and to Enders. GMG, 
which had written only a short letter, was referred to the Guidance and invited to submit 
arguments  which  took  the  Guidance  into  account.  The  other  parties’  submissions  were 
acknowledged and they were advised also to make submissions to the EU Commission’s DG 
Competition because many of the points which they had raised appeared to BIS to relate to 
potential competition impacts.64

3.22  On 25 August 2010 Dr Cable met Brendan Barber of the TUC at a regular quarterly meeting. 
The minutes record that Mr Barber raised the question of the bid but Dr Cable’s evidence, 
which is consistent with the minutes, confirms that the Secretary of State was careful not 
to give Mr Barber an oral hearing (which would have been inconsistent with his approach 
towards other interested parties) and simply responded by reiterating the request for written 
submissions. The minutes state:65

“BB said that the reported Newscorp acquisition of BSkyB was a serious issue for media 
unions. BB said that there were practical, industrial issues on the media plurality issue 
which the unions were concerned about. SoS said that there was a careful process to 
be followed, and that he had no pre-conceived judgments, but he said he would be 
willing to hear any genuine representation and consider the evidence.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIand Mr Cable’s evidence was:66

“...I have regular quarterly meetings with the TUC and the matter was raised at my 
meeting with them on 25 August 2010 but I declined to discuss the matter further...”

3.23  Officials next worked up a submission dated 3 September 2010 with advice for Dr Cable who, 
officials believed, was keen both fully to understand the situation and to know: “What would 
a representation which does provide valid grounds for him to intervene look like?”.67 They did 
not find the arguments straightforward: “The arguments are complex and we recommend a 
further discussion before you make a decision”.68 It was at this point that the low statutory 
threshold for intervention was expressly drawn to Dr Cable’s attention:69

“In  summary,  we  believe  that  the  substantive  arguments  as  to  why  this  merger 
might be deemed to result in insufficient plurality of persons with control of media 
enterprises are not strong. Nevertheless, the legislation provides a deliberately low 
legal threshold for taking a decision to issue an intervention notice. You need only 
believe  it  is  or  may  be  the  case  that  the  specified  public  interest  consideration  is 
relevant to a consideration of the merger. The prospect of legal challenge arising at 
this initial intervention stage appears low since the process involved is relatively short 
and  would  not  involve  significant  burdens  on  the  parties  to  the  merger.  However, 
issuing an intervention notice initiates a formal statutory process and places you in 
the position of taking formal decisions in accordance with the requirements of the 
Enterprise Act 2002. The nest stage in that process would be for you to decide whether 
or not to refer the merger on public interest grounds to the Competition Commission. 
At  this  second  stage,  the  evidential  threshold  is  higher  and  the  prospects  of  legal 
challenge much greater. The evidence you would have on which to base that decision 
may  well  be  substantively  the  same  as  the  evidence  you  have  already  received  in 
submissions from the parties to the merger and from interested third parties.”

Counsel’s advice

3.24  Counsel  with  relevant  expertise  was  instructed  on  9  September  2010  and  she  advised  in 
conference on 16 September 2010. Legal privilege in that advice was very helpfully waived 
and  the  Inquiry  has  had  the  benefit  of  sight  of  the  instructions  to  counsel,  notes  of  the 
conference  and  subsequent  emails  recording  further  advice  given  subsequently  as  events 
unfolded.70 Counsel took a very different view to that initially taken by officials within BIS. Her 
advice marked a turning point insofar as advice given to Dr Cable is concerned, pointing very 
clearly in favour of intervention.

3.25  Counsel advised that it was entirely open to the Secretary of State to conclude that it is, or may 
be the case that media plurality is, or may be, relevant to the proposed acquisition. It would 
be difficult to argue, in the face of submissions from Enders and others, that media plurality 
could not be a consideration. The fact that the European Commission would investigate any 
potential  market  distortion  would  not  be  a  good  enough  reason  for  not  intervening,  if  it 
appeared there may be concerns about media plurality. Deciding not to intervene would be 
a conclusive determination of the question of media plurality and would carry a greater risk

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iof successful challenge than a decision to intervene. So far as the Guidance was concerned, 
this merger may be regarded as exceptional since it involved a large number of news outlets 
coming under complete common control (because Sky News provided news to Channel 5 and 
local radio) and was analogous to the example given in paragraph 8.8 of the Guidance. As for 
the prospects of challenge, News Corp would be unlikely to challenge a decision to intervene 
and, if it did, then it would be more likely than not to be unsuccessful. On the other hand, 
the chances of a decision not to intervene being successfully challenged were higher than the 
chances of the opposite decision being successfully challenged.71

Further submissions to Dr Cable

3.26  Meanwhile, submissions advocating intervention continued to arrive. BT wrote again on 16 
September  2010.  The  author  of  that  letter,  Ian  Livingstone,  CEO  of  BT  Group,  referred  to 
having spoken briefly to Dr Cable about the bid: “We spoke briefly about this when we met 
recently and I thought it would be helpful if we clarified a few points again as you still be 
considering  the matter”72 before summarising  and  augmenting BT’s previous  submissions. 
The BBC expressed its concerns by letter on 20 September 2010.73 It is clear that it was not 
possible  for  Dr  Cable  entirely  to  insulate  himself  from  contact  with  interested  parties  as 
this reference to meeting Mr Livingstone and the meeting with the TUC referred to above 
demonstrate. However, it is hard to see how such encounters could have been avoided. It 
is all but inevitable that a person in Dr Cable’s position (and later Mr Hunt’s) would come 
across interested parties during the course of their other duties. That is the nature of the 
environment in which this quasi-judicial decision making was being conducted.

3.27  The submissions received by BIS, arguing in favour of intervention, were not copied to News 
Corp by BIS. Nor was News Corp given any formal written indication by BIS as to the gist of 
the case against it. News Corp did obtain a copy of the Enders submission because it had 
been posted on the internet. On 20 September 2010, as is evidenced by an email of that 
date, Hogan Lovells, on News Corp’s behalf, intimated to BIS that it wished to respond to the 
Enders submission. They did so in writing in a very detailed letter dated 29 September 2010,74 
arguing that Enders’ submission misunderstood and presented a flawed and misleading view 
of the relevant legal and regulatory framework for the assessment of media public interest 
considerations; relied on unsupported and speculative assertions concerning the effects of 
the proposed transaction; and was founded on selective and in certain instances, misleading 
public interest considerations in relation to the proposed transaction.

3.28  On  the  day  on  which  these  further  submissions  arrived  Dr  Cable,  with  the  assistance  of 
his officials, was in fact preparing lines to take on News Corp predicated on a decision to 
intervene:75

“As discussed, the SoS has amended the lines to take on Newscorp. It now reads:
I have received various representations on this issue from a variety of [media] groups. 
It is my statutory responsibility to ensure that issues of media plurality are carefully 
considered in takeovers. Given the [serious] concerns [about plurality] raised with me 
in this case, I have asked the independent experts at Ofcom to investigate the matter

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIand report back to me. [I will not comment any further on this case until I hear back 
from Ofcom]...”

3.29  The  arrival  of  News  Corp’s  further  submissions  prompted  BIS  to  take  further  advice  from 
counsel and to prepare a submission for the Secretary of State to consider with the further 
submissions. Counsel remained of the view that the grounds to challenge an intervention 
were not particularly strong given the significant discretion available to the Secretary of State 
in deciding whether to intervene, and the non-determinative nature of that decision.76

3.30  Officials continued to make ready for a decision to intervene: a draft statement to Parliament 
was prepared on 8 October 2010.77 On the same day, an opinion from solicitors Slaughter & 
May, supporting intervention, was submitted by an alliance of communications and media 
companies (“the Alliance”) comprising: the BBC, BT, GMG, ANL, Trinity Mirror and Northcliffe 
Media.78 Four of these companies had previously made individual submissions in opposition 
to the bid.

3.31  A draft copy of the same advice was later submitted by the Financial Times (FT) on 14 October 

2010 together with a letter supporting intervention.79

3.32  As with the Enders submission, News Corp was not provided with a copy of, or informed of 
the gist of the Slaughter & May advice by BIS. However, it obtained a copy of the draft advice 
and sent detailed written submissions in rebuttal to BIS on 27 October 2010.80 They were put 
to counsel but they did not cause her to change her advice:81

“Counsel confirmed on Friday that nothing in the latest submission from Hogan Lovells 
caused her to change her previous assessment of the legal case for intervention and 
risk of challenge – the existence of uncertainty about the impact on the public interest 
does not preclude intervention to require a more substantive initial assessment of 
such impacts”.

3.33  The campaigning group 38 Degrees delivered a petition with 18,956 signatories on 14 October 
2010.82 Officials considered that Dr Cable ought not to meet the group so as to “preserve his 
impartiality in considering the merits of the case”83 and Dr Cable did not do so.

3.34  Support for News Corp’s position was expressed by Capital Research and Management, an 
American based investment management organisation which had client mutual funds holding 
an approximately 5% stake in BSkyB.84 Further support, in the form of a report by Berenberg 
Bank, appears to have arrived after the decision had been taken but before it was announced 
and was forwarded to Ofcom.85

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid IThe decision to intervene

3.35  Dr Cable decided to intervene. His decision was made public on the morning of 4 November 
2010. News Corp was informed the evening before the announcement of the timing but not 
the substance of the decision.86 The timing of the decision followed formal notification of the 
proposed transaction to the European competition authorities by the parties to the deal. The 
Secretary of State explained his decision in these terms:87

“Having regard to the Guidance, my view was that as the merger involved a situation 
where several significant sources of news would be coming under common control 
the situation was at least akin to examples given in the Guidance as to when such 
exceptional circumstances might arise. As such my intervention in this case represented 
a reasonable and appropriate use of my power to intervene.
I took a decision to intervene which was on the basis of my belief that there was or 
may have been a public interest consideration specified in Section 58(2C)(a) of the 
Enterprise  Act  relevant  to  the  consideration  of  the  merger,  namely  to  ensure  that 
there is sufficient plurality of persons with control of media enterprises in the UK. This 
decision was one for me, and me alone, to take on the information before me. The 
decision I took was that it was appropriate to require Ofcom to undertake an initial 
investigation to enable the substantive arguments to be explored more fully.”

3.36  Dr  Cable  did  not  seek  to  hide  his  concern  about  the  political  influence  of  the  Murdochs, 
although he maintained that he recognised at all times the legal parameters of the decision 
he was taking. He continued:

“Having considered all the evidence and submissions, it seemed clear to me that the 
proposed merger did raise genuine concerns affecting the public interest and that 
these should be properly considered. In my opinion as a politician, I also believed that 
the  Murdochs’  political  influence  exercised  through  their  newspapers  had  become 
disproportionate.  The  accusation  that  leading  political  figures  in  the  Conservative 
Party  and  the  Labour  Party  had  offered  disproportionate  access  to  the  Murdoch’s 
[sic] was widely made, as was the perception that both parties had shown excessive 
deference  to  their  views  (as  expressed  through  News  International  newspapers). 
But in both respects I recognised that I could only act within the constraints of the 
legislation as described above.”

3.37  The effect of the EIN which Dr Cable issued on 4 November 2010 was to require both the 
OFT and OFCOM separately to investigate the proposed transaction and report to him by 
31 December 2010.88 The OFT’s remit was to advise on considerations relevant to making a 
reference to the Competition Commission on competition grounds and to decide whether it 
believed that a European relevant merger situation would be created if the transaction was 
executed. It also had a discretion to advise and make recommendations on the sufficiency 
of  plurality  of  persons  with  control  of  media  enterprises  (because  that  public  interest 
consideration was identified as relevant in the EIN) and to summarise any representations 
about the case which it received and which related to that issue.89 Ofcom had no discretion and 
was required to report with advice and recommendations on the effect of the media plurality 
consideration identified in the EIN on the case, as well as to summarise any representations

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIabout the case which it received relating to that media plurality issue.90 In the result OFT 
and Ofcom reported to Mr Hunt and not to Dr Cable because responsibility for the bid was 
transferred whilst they were both investigating.

3.38  Hogan Lovells engaged BIS in correspondence about the reasoning for the decision but, in 
line with counsel’s earlier prediction, News Corp did not go so far as to seek judicial review 
of the decision to intervene.91

3.39  This process, whilst entirely proper, was confused by the fact that people made submissions 
at  different  times,  and  there  was  a  lack  of  transparency  arising  from  the  fact  that  the 
representations made were not published by BIS (although in some cases they were published 
by those making them). Neither was it necessary for Mr Cable to explain the reason for his 
decision once he had reached one. A more formal, streamlined process in the future with 
more transparency both about the arguments being made and the reasons for the decision, 
might help to avoid any potential concerns about bias or appearance of bias.

Media lobbying behind the scenes

3.40  Of particular interest to the Inquiry was the behind the scenes lobbying activity related to 
the bid. The interactions between those acting on behalf of media companies and politicians 
concerning this multi billion pound proposed media transaction provide a good example of 
how easily the relationship can become unhealthy. Under this subheading, the Report seeks, 
in relation to the bid whilst it was Dr Cable’s responsibility, to examine who was lobbying 
behind the scenes, why they were doing it behind the scenes, whom they were targeting, 
what were they seeking, how were they going about achieving their aims, and with what 
results.

3.41  The  evidence  makes  abundantly  clear  that  News  Corp  mounted  a  determined  lobbying 
campaign in support of its bid from the outset which went well beyond the written submissions 
which it made to Dr Cable. As a matter of generality, James Murdoch explained:92

“I think in any situation, any business is going to – yes, is going to try to advocate the 
merits of its case, be it an investment case or a regulatory case, to a wide audience of 
policy-makers who may or may not be in a position to have some input into it”.

3.42  The day to day lobbying effort was led by Mr Michel. In relation to the duties of public affairs 

executives James Murdoch was clear that:93

“...Mr Michel’s job was to engage with special advisers and at a political level with 
Westminster, to put it broadly. That is what a public affairs executive does....”

3.43  Mr Michel did not act alone. James Murdoch was also speaking to politicians about the bid, 
when the opportunity presented itself, and the evidence showed the interaction of others 
from time to time. Internally, a number of senior people are seen copied into Mr Michel’s 
emails reporting back his contacts with politicians, SpAds and officials.

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I3.44 

In addition to his single conversation with Dr Cable, James Murdoch spoke to a number of 
senior politicians about the bid. The first of these was Mr Hunt to whom he spoke on 15 June 
2010 (the day on which the bid was launched and James Murdoch also spoke to Dr Cable). 
When asked whether the bid was discussed, James Murdoch could not remember but he 
realistically thought that it would have been:94

“I  don’t.  I  don’t  remember.  I  think  –  but  I  mean,  it  was  in  those  days  around  the 
announcement of the bid, so I’d be surprised if it weren’t [discussed], and I would 
have taken the same position that I took publicly and that we took with anyone who 
would listen.”

3.45  Mr Hunt confirmed that the bid had been discussed. Both at that time and in his evidence 
he did not hide his opinions which were broadly sympathetic to the bid. He was, of course, 
entitled to hold an opinion about the bid and it was entirely unsurprising that the Secretary 
of State for Culture, Media and Sport should have a view about a proposed transaction of this 
scale in the media sector:95

“I  have  always  been  open  about  the  fact  that  I  was  broadly  sympathetic  to  the 
proposed acquisition prior to taking responsibility for it.
I expressed those views when James Murdoch called me to tell me about the planned 
acquisition in June 2010.”

3.46  Throughout  the  bid,  Mr  Michel  maintained  a  dialogue  with  DCMS  about  the  proposed 
transaction. This communication was conducted principally, but not exclusively, through one 
of Mr Hunt’s special advisers, Adam Smith. That contact (and contact with BIS and others) is 
primarily recorded in Mr Michel’s emails, but also in text messages; and it is further evidenced 
by telephone records provided to the Inquiry. At the outset of a consideration of his evidence, 
it is necessary to make two important observations about Mr Michel’s emails.

3.47  First, Mr Michel’s emails reporting this contact to his colleagues are very often worded as 
if he has had direct conversations with Mr Hunt. As was made clear when the emails were 
disclosed  to  the  Inquiry,  and  as  was  confirmed  by  Mr  Michel  in  a  statement  exhibiting  a 
detailed supporting analysis, that was generally not the case. In particular, he maintains that 
he had no conversation with Mr Hunt between 24 December 2010 and the end of July 2011 
relating to the BSkyB bid, beyond two formal meetings which he attended as part of the News 
Corp team (and which are considered later in this section of the Report). Other contact during 
this period was limited to seeing him very briefly before a dinner and to some personal text 
messages (which are also considered later in this section of the Report). Mr Michel wrote as 
he did as a form of shorthand:96

“At no point between 24 December 2010 and the end of July 2011 did I have any 
direct conversation with Jeremy Hunt relating to the BSkyB proposal beyond the two 
formal meetings I attended with the News Corp team referred to above.
Given the absences of direct interaction with Jeremy Hunt which I have just described, 
it may appear surprising that within the emails in Exhibit KRM18 there are emails 
after 24 December 2010 the language of which suggests that I had frequent contact

1320

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIwith Jeremy Hunt on the BSkyB proposal. In the emails I use language such as “spoke 
to Hunt”, “had a call with JH”, “JH said”, “Jeremy said” and other variations. I often 
use the wording “JH confidential” as a heading for emails.
I want to make absolutely clear that such phrases are no more than shorthand for 
what I was told by someone within Jeremy Hunt’s office, almost invariably his special 
adviser Adam Smith. For the purposes of these emails, I did not distinguish between 
Jeremy  Hunt’s  advisers  and  him  personally.  His  advisers  were  there  to  assist  and 
advise Jeremy Hunt and it was my understanding that when they told me something, 
it was always on behalf of the Minister and after having conferred with him. It was 
on this basis that I relayed the information to my colleagues in the emails, using this 
form of shorthand.” (emphasis added)

3.48  Second, the terms in which Mr Michel relayed information were often not as accurate or 
precise as they might have been, and he did not always clearly distinguish between what he 
had been told and his own thoughts. A number of witnesses commented upon this, or took 
issue  with  specific  examples,  particularly  Mr  Smith:  “...I  do  not  always  recognise  them  to 
be an accurate reflection of conversations which I had with Mr Michel”.97 In some instances 
there was clear exaggeration. Further, Mr Michel is often relating the thoughts of one person 
about  what  another  is  thinking  or  likely  to  do,  in  circumstances  where  it  might  either  be 
speculation or simply wrong. For this reason, Mr Michel’s emails have been treated with real 
caution. Even so, they remain of very considerable evidential significance by providing an 
insight into News Corp’s media lobbying effort.

3.49  Mr Michel himself explained: “...Sometimes I would add some elements that can be helpful 

for the team”.98

3.50  Rupert Murdoch’s evidence was:99

“Q.  Were you not surprised by the degree of apparent closeness between Mr Michel 
and Mr Hunt’s office?
A.  No, and I don’t want to say anything against Mr Michel, but I think there could 
have been a little bit of exaggeration there”.

3.51  Dr Cable, when dealing with one of Mr Michel’s early emails said:100

“Would you just allow me to make a general comment on this reference to people 
close  to  me,  because  there  are  continued  references  to  so-called  advisers,  people 
who are close to me. I have no idea who these people are. Nobody was authorised 
to speak on my behalf, and there are whole sets of comments like this which I don’t 
recognise, so – just so I don’t have to repeat that in response to every question”.

3.52  On the day that the bid was launched, Mr Michel wrote in an email that he had “Had a call 
from  Hunt’s  adviser”  who  “Said  there  shouldn’t  be  media  plurality  issue  and  believed  the 
UK Government would be supportive throughout the process [despite what the Standard for

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iexample is suggesting this evening].”101 Mr Smith did not deny that a conversation took place 
but he did deny saying that the UK Government would be supportive throughout the process 
and took issue with other parts of the email.

3.53  A second email stated that “Jeremy just called”, and recorded that in an interview for the FT 
Mr Hunt had said that the bid was: “matter for competition authorities but he didn’t see any 
problems”.102 Mr Hunt’s actual words were: “It does seem to me that News Corp do control 
Sky  already.  So  it  isn’t  clear  to  me  that  in  terms  of  media  plurality  there  is  a  substantive 
change, but I don’t want to second guess what regulators might decide”.103 The impact of this 
public comment had later to be taken into account by the Prime Minister before deciding to 
transfer the decision to Mr Hunt.

3.54  The above contacts were the start of a pattern of behind the scenes lobbying extending far 
wider than the actual decision maker, or even his department, but also to DCMS, no doubt 
because of its media portfolio and, in due course, to a number of others across Government 
and beyond.

3.55  At  this  early  stage  of  the  bid,  it  is  contact  with  BIS  that  was  the  primary  objective  of  Mr 
Michel’s efforts. By 23 June 2010 Mr Michel was following up James Murdoch’s telephone 
call of 15 June 2010 to Dr Cable and working on procuring a meeting between the two. As 
James Murdoch emphasised in his evidence, it was a face-to-face meeting at which to put his 
case that he really wanted: “...all we wanted to do was to be able to sit down in a proper way 
...Please sit us down and let us make our case”.104 This must have been a priority for Mr Michel 
but he received a disappointing response from BIS, in keeping with Dr Cable’s decision not to 
meet the parties, which he reported by email to James Murdoch in these terms:105

“Vince has been advised by his team it would be better to meet with you once things 
have settled down on the Sky process in order to avoid any media questions on the 
purpose / content of the meeting.
Vince is keen to meet for a catch-up as you both discussed on the phone”.

3.56  The email is not to be read as meaning that Mr Michel had direct contact with Dr Cable, in 
view of the shorthand that the former was prone to use. It may be that the reference to 
meeting for a catch-up as discussed on the phone relates to the conversation between Dr 
Cable and James Murdoch on 15 June 2010, in which a BIS official had understood Dr Cable 
to have “vaguely agreed” to meet James Murdoch.106

3.57  The lobbyist did not have to report to James Murdoch a meeting with Mr Hunt on 28 June 
2010 because Mr Michel, James Murdoch, together with Matthew Anderson of News Corp, 
were all present. For his part, Mr Hunt was not accompanied by officials and the meeting was 
not minuted, although he thought that the bid would have been discussed. He explained that 
it was one of a number of such meetings that he held with industry leaders during the early 
days of his tenure at DCMS:107

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“A.  Yes. I was told by my officials that it was entirely proper to have meetings where 
there were officials present who took minutes, and meetings where there weren’t 
officials present and minutes weren’t taken and it was entirely my discretion and I 
had that meeting with Mr Murdoch. I also had meetings with other officials, with the 
chairman of the BBC Trust, the head of ITV and a number of other people when I’d just 
become Secretary of State.
Q.  Do you believe that the BSkyB bid was discussed on that occasion?
A.  I would be very surprised if it wasn’t discussed, because obviously it would have 
been top of Mr Murdoch’s mind. I don’t remember any particular discussions...”

3.58  By 28 July 2010, Mr Michel was reporting contact with “people very close to VC” asserting 

that:108

“-he is keen to be seen as the most pro-competition SoS and as we know he is very 
much anti-regulation
-on  our  particular  issue,  he  strongly  believes  the  deal  doesn’t  change  the  market 
situation or would have any impact on media plurality”.

3.59  Whether those views really were the views of Dr Cable about the bid at the time is unlikely, 
Dr Cable denied that they were.109 The views recorded are consistent however with the views 
of at least some of the officials within the Department at that time and with the advice that 
Dr Cable was receiving.

3.60  When the journalist Robert Peston asserted on 15 September 2010 that Dr Cable was likely 
to issue an intervention notice, Mr Michel turned to DCMS to try and check the position. He 
texted Mr Hunt directly, who replied that he did not know anything. Mr Michel then reported 
that reply to colleagues in his idiosyncratic shorthand and in terms which went beyond those 
of the text which he had received: “Jeremy Hunt is not aware and thinks it’s not credible at 
all. He is checking now”.110 He must have thought that there was a least a chance of obtaining 
some confidential information about the bid this way, although there is no evidence that he 
did in fact do so.

3.61  Mr  Michel’s  emails  to  his  News  Corp  colleagues  indicate that  he  began  to  try  a  new  tack 
soon  afterwards  by  engaging  key  Liberal  Democrat  politicians.  On  20  September  2010  he 
reported:111

“Had chat with Don Foster; DCMS spokesman for Libdems this morning. Very relaxed 
about the bid can’t see plurality review taking place”.

3.62  A week later Mr Michel had “Talked to Vince’s main economic adviser, who sits in the Lords, 
over the week-end. He is leading on this for him.” The peer had been reassuring (although 
by that time Dr Cable was in fact well on his way to deciding against NewsCorp): “I was told 
there is absolutely no reason to believe he would want a referral”. Mr Michel was planning on 
keeping lines of communication open and sharing News Corp’s arguments.112 The peer was

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iprobably Lord Oakeshott.113 Dr Cable was clear in evidence that in fact no one was leading for 
him. Whatever Lord Oakeshott actually said, it must have been in a personal capacity.

3.63  That is not to say that Dr Cable had had no contact with Lord Oakeshott. He explained how he 
had spoken to Lord Oakeshott and a number of Liberal Democrats including Don Foster, who 
also features in Mr Michel’s emails. Dr Cable emphasised that he only ever sought background 
and context from these colleagues and that he did not seek their views on the actual decision 
that he had to make:114

“Well, because I just wanted background understanding of the legislation and how it 
had originated. I had no background in media policy...
I wasn’t seeking their opinion on whether the merger was good or bad or whether I 
should intervene, but I did think it was useful to have a background understanding of 
the kind of questions you have just been asking me.”

3.64  On 8 October 2010 Mr Michel reported seeing “... an adviser to Cable’s team on business 
issues” and relayed details in a lengthy email. Whoever this was gave Mr Michel the impression 
that there was a strong political influence playing on the pending intervention decision:115

“-at the moment, they are assuming Vince will refer because of the political pressure, 
the heavy media debate and the need for him to be seen as bringing scrutiny to a 
Murdoch transaction.
-there is real unease in Libdem ranks over Coulson and the relationship to NI. Simon 
Hughes, deputy leader, is on a mission to make this an NI issue. The more it is linked 
to NI/NoW, the more it will stay political and toxic...”

3.65  The assumption quoted above turned out to be correct as to the result but is not as to the 
reasons for it. Significantly though, it fuelled a growing belief on the part of Mr Michel that 
the wider political agenda was important and that advantage might be had if News Corp was 
to assist Dr Cable politically. The conversation also gave rise to renewed tactical thinking as to 
the best way to refine the lobbying effort. As Mr Michel recorded later in his email report:116

“-the adviser was very clear that if we try to aggressively push Cable, it will have 
a negative impact. But changing the narrative in the main media would help him 
politically a lot and help him inside the Cabinet.
-advised to brief all the key lib-dems in coming weeks and go through the impact of 
the transaction is the key since it was made clear that the media agenda has had a 
very negative influence on the decision-making process
-Many people around Cable are from the left or Labour and are briefing against us. 
We need to engage with them behind the scenes even more.
-Its the right timing as Parliament is back Monday.

1324

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansINB:  the  Coulson/NI  issues  are  agitating  Cable’s  political  base  in  a  major  way  and 
there is absolutely no upside in trying to use NI in any lobbying. I am seeing the Chief 
Exec of the LibDem Tuesday on it.
-regarding  items  we  could  help  Cable  with:  we  should  try  to  help  him  make  his 
pro  business  arguments,  for  example  supporting  his  campaign  to  bring  flexibility 
to migration cap and work with his team (I can get the people in the City who are 
helping him to come see us).
Cable  needs  help  in  working  with  the  City  and  we  can  have  a  two-way  beneficial 
conversation with him.” (emphasis added)

3.66  Political and media considerations were irrelevant to the decision which fell to be taken by 
a specific minister in accordance with a test prescribed by statute. But News Corp clearly 
believed that Dr Cable might have been capable of being influenced by these extraneous 
factors and Mr Michel was beginning to contemplate how the company’s corporate muscle 
might be deployed in order to try and influence the decision by helping Dr Cable politically. 
Dr Cable was clear that in fact he maintained his focus on the correct test.117 Had he been 
influenced as intended, then the proper exercise of the media plurality test would have been 
vitiated by irrelevant considerations.

3.67 

In the meantime, Mr Michel  and  Rebekah Brooks had  met Mr Hunt and  Mr Smith  at the 
Conservative Party Conference on 5 October 2010. Mr Michel reported it to James Murdoch 
as: “...a very useful meeting with Jeremy Hunt today on the bid ...”.118 Mr Hunt recalled how: 
“...I think they expressed some concern that they weren’t getting a sympathetic hearing from 
Vince Cable, but not much more than that” and thought that he: “...would have said that my 
own view broadly speaking was that I didn’t think there was a plurality issue, so I would have 
probably expressed some surprise that Vince Cable may have thought there was more of a 
problem”.119 The opportunity was plainly used to lobby Mr Hunt in the hope that it might have 
led somehow to influencing Dr Cable.

3.68  Mr Michel followed up the encounter by sending Mr Smith information about the bid for 
Mr Hunt.120 The provision of information which News Corp thought relevant to the bid to 
Mr Smith, for Mr Hunt, was to become a feature of their relationship. On this occasion the 
material was passed on to Mr Hunt and his reaction to it communicated back to Mr Michel by 
email: “Jeremys [sic] response to this – “persuasive””.121 The effect was not a profound change 
of mind. Mr Hunt was not hostile to the bid. But Mr Michel clearly thought it important to 
keep Mr Hunt abreast of the issue and on his radar.

3.69  On  12  October  2010,  Mr  Michel  again  spoke  to  “Vince’s  main  adviser”  and  reported  the 
conversation back to colleagues by email. The email set out advice to target Lord Oakeshott 
and how to go about it. There was fresh mention that the referral decision would be a political 
one and advice to keep briefing certain politicians:122

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“-he had one strong advice (as mentioned previously): the most influential person for 
Vince now is Lord Oashekott [sic], who is a difficult character and hates lobbying (and 
doesn’t like our empire either ...) and who Vince talks to more than 10 times / day.
It was suggested that we should try a very soft approach with him; get him meet 
with James Harding to get his views on some of BIS key items, like migration cap, 
and get me to pop in at some stage to give him an update on the current battle we 
face and inform his views. It would be a much better setting than a direct lobbying 
conversation. Do we think it’s ok?
-the referral decision will be a political one, especially if tuitions [sic] fees debate gets 
nasty in Vince’s party and he need something to reassure his base ...
-he also recommended to keep briefing senior lib-dems and key Cabinet members as 
we have started to do, to push things with Vince”.

3.70  Dr Cable confirmed that he consulted Lord Oakeshott on other issues but not about the bid: 
“...I consulted him on other issues, banking for example, but certainly not on this issue” as “...
one of several people I rely on for general advice”. He also denied speaking to Lord Oakeshott 
ten  times  a  day  or  that  wider  political  considerations  were  relevant  to  the  intervention 
decision.123 But the perception as relayed by Mr Michel continued to portray the decision as 
political and, consequently, it was regarded therefore as one which might be influenced by 
wider political considerations.

3.71  Mr Michel took forward the effort to identify key Liberal Democrats when, on 18 October 2010, 
he reported back on a meeting with Lord Clement-Jones, the Liberal Democrat spokesman 
in the House of Lords for culture, media and sport, explaining which Liberal Democrats he 
planned to target next, plainly in the belief that they were people to whom Dr Cable might 
talk to about the bid:124

“...His party is very keen to look at this as a political decision.
...
We had a good chat re-key [sic] influencers around Cable. He has a little set of people 
around him he will call to ask for opinion and many Lib-Dem, Labour MPs will be 
writing to him to apply further pressure.
...
It won’t do any harm to explain our case to selected individuals who Cable is likely to 
call:
Lord Newby – I will meet
Lord Oakeshot- said he would be VERY receptive to a message from Patience on this: 
Matthew can discuss asap?
Lord Razzal – I will meet
Chairman of Business Committee, Adrian Bailey – will meet” (emphasis added).

3.72  Dr Cable did not recall any Liberal Democrat MPs writing to him about the bid and told the 
Inquiry for the purposes of the intervention the only “little set of people” around him were his

1326

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIofficials and lawyers. He did confirm though that the modus operandi revealed in the email 
was an example of the kind of commercial lobbying which happens a lot:125

“Yes. I mean lots of this happened, and one just has to learn to recognise it for what 
it is. But yes, I –and part of my role as being Secretary of State is to be open to people 
with opinions, and to engage with them.
...I suppose Mr Michel was an example of a lobbyist at work. I’m not making judgments 
about him and how he operated, but that is commercial lobbying indeed”.

3.73  Mr Michel moved next from the strategy of targeting politicians who it was thought might 
be contacted by Dr Cable to a more direct, proactive and specific approach. Two politicians 
emerged whom Mr Michel hoped would actively contact Dr Cable to impress upon him the 
economic benefits of the bid should it succeed. On 1 November 2010 he reported:126

“Mission accomplished.
-Libdem MP, former Sky employee, with major Sky customer centres in his constituency 
and  around,  will  contact  Vince  Cable  to  ask  him  to  bear  in  mind  the  economic  / 
investment point of view rather than getting influenced by political games, especially 
in  times  of  austerity  and  very  difficult  economic  environment  for  those  areas.  He 
will also emphasise the opportunity for Cable to show the maturity of the Libdems 
as coalition partners, working for the long-term, and will draw from the Coalition 
government experience lib-dems have had in Scotland. He agrees with the need for 
this to be looked at by Brussels rather than scrutinised again on plurality ground in 
the UK.
-Alex Salmond is very keen to also put these issues across to Cable and have a call 
with you tomorrow or Wednesday. His team will also brief the Scottish press on the 
economic importance of News Corp for Scotland.” (emphasis added)

3.74  The desire to deploy economic arguments of this sort, based on the economic importance of 
a business within a community, was wholly inappropriate. Such arguments were irrelevant 
to the decision which the Secretary of State had to make and could not lawfully be taken 
into account. Any decision influenced by them would have been impugned if the subject of 
judicial review. At best Mr Michel and News Corp completely failed to appreciate this. Mr 
Salmond’s role is considered further below.127

3.75 

In  the  days  leading  up  to  and  immediately  after  the  announcement  of  the  decision  to 
intervene, Mr Michel had further exchanges with a person or persons whom he described as 
an “adviser” or “main adviser” to Dr Cable.128 Mr Michel seemed optimistic that he might be 
able to meet with officials but his hopes were dashed on 8 November 2010 when he reported 
to James Murdoch:129

“Just had a private call with Vince’s main adviser.
He  said  he  believed  there  were  huge  risks  for  me  to  meet  with  him  to  talk  about 
anything that has to do with the “OfCom business”, which he rules out completely.

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid IToo much scrutiny. They also want to be able to say they took an independent view. 
Asked me to be in touch regularly in coming weeks, if only to provide him with any 
evidence / materials we would like Vince / him to read”.

3.76  Mr Michel’s persistence yielded some useful information when he got an indication (rightly 
as it turned out) as to the imminence of the decision (but not its substance). On 2 November 
2010  he  reported  that  he  had  been  told  by  Baroness  Rawlings,  the  Government’s  DCMS 
spokeswoman  in  the  House  of  Lords,  that:  “she  believed  Cable  was  preparing  to  make  a 
decision within a few days of our filing becoming public.”130

3.77  On the morning of the intervention announcement itself, Mr Michel was in contact by text 
with Dr Cable’s adviser whom is reported to have texted that News Corp had: “put a v strong 
case which will stand you in good stead on this”.131 It is possible that the adviser was referring 
to the coming steps in the process, because the intervention decision had gone against News 
Corp.

3.78  Mr  Michel  continued  to  lobby  despite  the  set  back  which  the  intervention  was  for  News 
Corp, hoping no doubt to increase the chances that the next decision in the process would 
be more favourable to his employer. On 9 November 2010 he met with Rupert Harrison, a 
Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the terms of his email report to James 
Murdoch suggests that he had recently also spoken to Vicky Pryce and David Laws. Whatever 
he was actually told, (as to which I expressly make no finding not least because it has not 
been the subject of evidence) what Mr Michel reported did not in fact reflect what actually 
happened:132

“Vince made a political decision, probably without even reading the legal advice, as 
confirmed also to us by Vicky Price and David Laws yesterday
I underlined the impact such regulatory process has for us financially; the signals it 
sends to major global potential investors. Rupert said the case would be made to BIS”.

3.79  A text message from Mr Michel to Mr Harrison on the same day also raises the issue of the 
Treasury making a case to BIS. It records the former asking the latter if the Rt Hon George 
Osborne would send a letter to Dr Cable on the merger and its economic importance. Mr 
Michel went so far as to offer assistance with the content:133

“Rupert, just spoke with James. It would be helpful if George were to send a latter 
to Vince on our Sky merger and its economic importance, separate from the Ofcom 
process. Do you think it is a possibility? I can of course help with the content. Best, 
fred [sic].”

3.80  Mr Osborne made clear that the invitation to write to Dr Cable was not acted upon:134

“[Rupert Harrison] says –and I believe him – that there was a general discussion that 
was not focused on the BSkyB bid. There is a reference in the email to making the case 
to BIS. He’s checked and there is no contact that he’s been able to see, between the

not – if it was raised – was not followed up.
He makes the point to me that he wouldn’t have known whether Dr Cable had read 
the legal advice or not, because he wouldn’t have had a conversation with Dr Cable...”

3.81  Mr Michel displayed particular tenacity in trying to secure a meeting. After being rebuffed 
in relation to a meeting about the bid on 8 November 2010, he entered into a protracted 
email exchange with Giles Wilkes, one of Dr Cable’s SpAds, seeking instead a more general 
meeting.135 Mr Wilkes agreed in principle to such a meeting but would not agree to it taking 
place whilst decisions about the bid were pending. When asked when would be good for him, 
he replied: “Let us assume it is when a google of “Vince Cable, “News International” and “Sky” 
doesn’t turn anything up!” Mr Michel persisted by seeking to elicit whether there had been 
meetings with any of the other interested parties: “So that means no other possible interested 
parties in the transaction have met with you at all since June [Telegraph, FT, Associated, BT, 
BBC. etc.]? To which he received this reply:136

“As it happened, I don’t think I’ve talked about this issue with any of them. Of course, 
in  briefing  at  Conference,  I  had  to  wander  into  a  room  full  of  media  people,  and 
people from the media contacted me on other matters. And I know someone senior 
at Sky in a personal capacity, but we have studiously avoided discussing this since it 
became such a hot issue.
I’m sure we’re both equally interested in staying within the bounds of proper conduct 
– forgive my caution”.

3.82  Mr  Michel  concluded  the  exchange  with  a  mollifying  response  before  reporting  to  James 
Murdoch that: “Vince is “very disciplined” about this”.137 That was on 15 November 2010. Mr 
Michel let the matter rest but he did not give up. He resumed the attempt on 14 December 
2010 after Ofcom had published an issues letter:138

“Just spoke to Vince’s main adviser.
Neither date I put forward for a meeting with Vince (7th or 10th Jan) is likely to work. 
Vince is out of the country at that time, on current plans.
I was told that he has yet to get “his full views on the advisability of a meeting – he 
is very keen to observe all the correct form and may therefore regard the possibility 
with  an  element  of  concern  until  extremely  thoroughly  briefed  on  all  possible 
consequences.
I think meeting, if it happens, will be in mid-January. Let’s see.”

3.83  Unlike Dr Cable, at this stage Mr Hunt had no objection to meeting News Corp, although he 
came to change his mind. When Mr Michel contacted him directly by text on 9 November 
2010 seeking a meeting for James Murdoch, Mr Hunt agreed.139 But before the meeting took 
place Mr Hunt received advice from his officials. The advice, which had been approved by in-
house legal advisers, recommended against the meeting because DCMS had no formal role 
in the intervention decision:140

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“There is no role in the process for the DCMS so we would recommend that you do 
not have any external discussions on the BSkyB media merger nor write to SoS BIS 
about it. If you want to contribute, you could write a letter stating facts backed up 
with evidence, provided it recognises the final decision is for the Business Secretary of 
State acting alone. However this carries risks to the robustness of the decision”.

3.84  Mr Hunt cancelled the meeting, explaining to the Inquiry that although he did not think that 

contact would have been wrong, it risked creating a parallel process:141

“This was probably the first time that I heard the phrase quasi-judicial or had some kind 
of exposure to what the implications of quasi-judicial meant, and we had a meeting 
in the diary initially and I decided to cancel that meeting not because I thought it 
was wrong to have contact with News Corporation, but because I thought they were 
probably wanting to have the meeting with me that Vince Cable had refused to have 
with them, and that therefore to have that meeting would be to create a parallel 
process where another government department is getting involved in the process in 
a way that might not be seen to be appropriate.”

3.85  The position was reported to James Murdoch by Mr Michel on 15 November 2010 by email:142

“Jeremy tried to call you. He has received very strong legal advice not to meet us today 
as the current process is treated as a judicial one (not a policy one) and any meeting 
could be referred to and jeopardize the entire process. Jeremy is very frustrated about 
it but the Permanent Secretary has now also been involved”.  

3.86  Use of the phrase “very strong legal advice” is an overstatement of the true position, which 

was a recommendation by officials which had been cleared by lawyers.

3.87  Mr Hunt was indeed frustrated and for essentially economic reasons. He told the Inquiry:143

“I  may  have  been  frustrated.  I  was  worried  about  a  bid  in  my  sector  that  could 
potentially  mean  that  thousands  more  jobs  would  be  created,  and  the  main 
protagonist was concerned about the process they were having to go through, so I 
may well have been worried.”

3.88  Mr Michel continued in his email to propose that his principal should instead telephone Mr 

Hunt. It is:144

“My advice would be not to meet him today as it would be counter-productive for 
everyone, but you could have a chat with him on his mobile which is completely fine, 
and I will liaise with his team privately as well.”

3.89 

It is surprising that Mr Michel, whose own belief appears to have been that Mr Hunt had 
received  very  strong  legal  advice  not  to  meet  James  Murdoch,  thought  it  appropriate  to

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIencourage telephone contact. The displeasure of James Murdoch to this news is apparent in 
his reply to Mr Michel: “You must be fucking joking. Fine. I will text him and find a time”.145

3.90  The call went ahead. Mr Hunt recalled: “I just heard Mr Murdoch out, and basically heard 
what  he  had  to  say  about  what  was  on  his  mind  at  that  time.”146  He  agreed  that  he  had 
probably been sympathetic but emphasised that he been careful to observe propriety:147

“Well, I wouldn’t have given him any reassurance about the media plurality decision 
that Vince Cable was taking because that was not my –that was not anything I could 
get involved with, and I would have made that clear to him, so I probably gave him a 
sympathetic hearing, but I wouldn’t have said that I can get involved in that decision 
because I had taken and accepted the advice that I couldn’t.”

3.91 

James Murdoch’s evidence was: “I believe he called me to apologise for cancelling the meeting 
but – I don’t have a specific recollection, but I think that’s what’s in the records.”148

3.92 

Jonathan  Stephens,  the  Permanent  Secretary  at  DCMS,  subsequently  explored  the  legal 
position  further,  obtaining  in  house  legal  advice  which  fully  addressed  the  relationship 
between DCMS and BIS in relation to the bid:149

“Whilst there is nothing legally which formally precludes the Secretary of State CMS 
from  making  representations  to  the  Secretary  of  State  BIS  to  inform  the  latter’s 
decision as to whether to refer the public interest considerations in this merger to 
the Competition Commission, it would be unwise to do so. This is because the task of 
assessing the impact of the merger on media plurality is expressly given to Ofcom, 
and because the Secretary of State CMS will almost certainly be able to see neither the 
report itself nor the underlying materials. Furthermore, and partly as a consequence, 
any representations made by the Secretary of State CMS are likely to raise the risk of 
challenge to a decision made by the Secretary of State BIS because it will appear to 
be purely political in nature (although, of course, it may well not be in fact, and thus 
be of limited assistance to him in making his assessment.”

3.93  Whatever the detail of the telephone call on 15 November 2010 there is no evidence that 
Mr Hunt sought to communicate it to Dr Cable. Mr Hunt correctly accepted that he should 
not become directly involved in the quasi-judicial process.150 In evidence, he recognised with 
hindsight that it would have been better for the conversation to have been heard and minuted 
by his officials.151 I agree.

3.94  Mr Michel soon pursued the private liaison with Mr Hunt’s team which he had proposed to 

take. In an email dated 23 November 2010 he relayed:152

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“I will have a session with Hunt’s adviser next Wednesday to update on Ofcom process 
and next steps.
Jeremy has also asked me to send him relevant documents privately”.

3.95  Having established this private channel of communication with DCMS about the bid before 
the decision was unexpectedly transferred to Mr Hunt, Mr Michel later sought vigorously to 
exploit it once the decision had been transferred.

3.96  Before  the  transfer,  News  Corp  fruitlessly  continued  their  lobbying  of  prominent  Liberal 
Democrats, still believing that it might indirectly influence Dr Cable. On 19 November 2010 
Mr Michel reported to James Murdoch:153

“Was told today by Cable’s adviser to approach any meeting with Lord Oakeshott as 
a proxy for Vince Cable, an intro. discussion on the substance of Rubicon and possible 
way forward.
Again, given his position of Chair of Cable’s business advisory council, he is the most 
influential person on any decision Vince will make” (emphasis added)

3.97 

James Murdoch had seen a prominent Liberal Democrat, Paul Marshall. Mr Marshall informed 
James Murdoch (forwarding an email via Mr Michel) that:154

“I have relayed the substance of our conversation to Vince’s office, but as you know, 
Vince  is  highly  independent-minded  so  I  can  make  no  promises  as  to  his  greater 
willingness to hold a meeting...”

3.98  On  2  December  2010,  Mr  Michel  had  conversations  with  an  adviser  to  the  Deputy  Prime 
Minister and an adviser to the Prime Minister. In relation to the former he reported to James 
Murdoch:155

“Honest discussion on the importance for us of getting Labour on board / comfortable 
with the transaction as it will influence Cable a lot
he will insist on the need for Vince to meet with us once Ofcom report published
need to support Nick when he makes announcement on copyright which goes against 
his election promise – timing end January – will be very tough for him with youth 
voters again”.

3.99  Tim Colborne, a SpAd working to Mr Clegg confirmed that he was the adviser in question, 
but disputed the accuracy of Mr Michel’s email. Mr Colborne’s note of the meeting recorded 
discussion on three topics: the Digital Economy Act; the BSkyB decision making process; and 
the broadcast landscape more generally. On the topic of BSkyB he said:156

“My recollections of the discussions in relation to BSkyB are that Frederic Michel asked 
me about how the process was going, and I informed him that I had no involvement in 
it, and knew nothing about how it was proceeding. I have never had a role in relation 
to the BSkyB bid, which was exclusively a matter for the relevant Secretary of State 
(who at that time was the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills). I

1332

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIfurther informed him that even if I had known, it would not be appropriate for me to 
speak to him about it. Frederic Michel went on to explain how the decision-making 
process was supposed to work...
I do not recognise Frederic Michel’s own account of this meeting as set out in his 
email  to  James  Murdoch.  I  have  no  recollection  of  an  “honest  discussion  on  the 
importance for us of getting Labour on board”, and I completely reject the suggestion 
that I offered to “insist on the need for Vince to meet with us once [the] Ofcom report 
[was] published”. I would not have offered to do so, and did not do so. When making 
handwritten notes of meetings, I always mark action points with an asterisk. There 
were no action points arising from this meeting.”

This is, perhaps, but one example of the need for real caution in relation to the accuracy of 
Mr Michel’s communications.

3.100  About his conversation with Mr Cameron’s adviser, Mr Michel recorded only one line relating 
to the bid: “On Sky transaction: recognised need to look at it only from a plurality point of 
view”.157 This was a correct statement of the approach which the decision maker was required 
to take but it is at odds with the belief expressed in Mr Michel’s earlier emails that wider 
political issues would influence the decision.

3.101  When Ofcom published an issues letter, Mr Michel set about gauging the reaction. On 14 
December 2010, he reported to James Murdoch in terms which show that he had not given 
up on a meeting:158

“Very good debrief with Hunt on the Issues letter. He is pretty amazed by its findings, 
methodology and clear bias.
He very much shares our views on it.
We are going to try to find a way for you to meet with him one/one before Xmas.”

3.102  On this occasion Mrs Brooks too was passing on information, conveying to Mr Michel what 

she said was Mr Osborne’s response:159

“Same from GO – total bafflement at response.”

3.103  Mr Osborne did not remember mention of the bid in conversation, and had not read Ofcom’s 
letter, but he did not doubt Mrs Brooks’ account that it had taken place and he remembered 
the occasion, a dinner in a restaurant. Neither did he take issue with Mrs Brooks’ evidence 
that he looked perplexed:160

“I have read the Ofcom issues letter in preparation for appearing before you today 
and I think that is the first time I’ve ever read that letter. Certainly it jogs no memory 
and I’ve done a search of my private office of whether the Ofcom issues letter was 
brought to my attention, and there’s no – we can find no evidence that it was.
So  I’m  perfectly  prepared  to  accept  that  there  was  a  conversation;  I  just  have  no 
memory of it, and perhaps the reason I was perplexed or baffled was because I hadn’t 
actually read the Ofcom issues letter”.

1333

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I3.104  Mr Osborne was clear that the process was quasi-judicial and he did not seek to influence Dr 
Cable’s decision. Indeed, he made plain to the Inquiry the political reasons why he did not 
have a strong view as to the outcome of the bid:161

“I didn’t have a strong view about its merits because as far as I could see, it was 
just going to cause us trouble one way or the other. Indeed, so it has proved to be, 
and I just thought it was either going to offend a group of newspapers and indeed 
broadcasters who we wanted to have good relations with if it was rejected – sorry, if 
it was accepted, and if it was rejected, it was going to offend another bunch of people 
who we want to have good relations with.
So I regarded the whole thing as a political inconvenience and something we just had 
to deal with and the best way to deal with it was to stick by the process”.

3.105  Mr Michel reported having seen Mr Foster from whom he said had had: “Some important 
feedback”.162  Amongst  the  many  emails  reporting  Mr  Michel’s  conversations  with  Liberal 
Democrats, recited above, that of 19 December 2010, relaying a conversation with Mr Clegg’s 
Chief of Staff, Jonny Oates, stands out because the view recorded is unequivocally focused on 
the correct test and the correct procedure:163

“Just had a private chat with Clegg’s chief of staff regarding the ongoing process.
He was very surprised when I pointed out to him that Cable will be tempted to take a 
decision with a lot of political influence.
For him, the referral is not a matter for “lib-dems”, it is a matter for the Secretary of 
State in accordance with his statutory obligations.
Said he was unclear therefore why News Corp is seeking out the views of people who 
have no locus in the decision making process and thinking that their views indicate 
that the decision will be “political.
For him, senior lib-dems who are going around giving us advice / recommendations 
are not representative of Vince’s mindset and way of making decisions. This is similar 
to what Vince’s adviser told me on Friday night: until the end, Vince will be keen to 
make up his own mind and not be influenced by anyone.
I told him it was hard to believe given all the feedback we are getting.
Contrary to my assertion, he said the Secretary of State will take the decision on its 
merits in accordance with his statutory obligations. If we have concerns, we should 
express them directly with BIS or Ofcom.”

3.106  The evidence, discussed earlier in this Section, shows that Dr Cable did focus on the statutory 
test, took specialist legal advice and made up his own mind. However, insofar as Mr Oates’ 
intention  was  to  reassure  News  Corp  that  the  bid  was  being  considered  with  scrupulous 
fairness by Dr Cable, what happened next entirely changed the perspective.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.  21 December 2010: Dr Cable’s comments and the 

4.1 

transfer	of	function
The comments and their context
In  the  course  of  his  work  as  a  constituency  MP,  on  Friday  3  December  2010,  Dr  Cable 
conducted a constituency surgery. Two undercover journalists pretended on that occasion 
to be constituents and local mothers concerned about the impact of proposed Child Benefit 
changes on their families. More broadly, they sought, and then actively questioned Dr Cable 
about,  his  views  on  the  coalition  Government.164  He  spoke  freely  about  the  bid  and  “the 
Murdoch press” saying (amongst other things):165

“You may wonder what is happening with the Murdoch press ...I have declared war 
on Mr Murdoch and I think we’re going to win” and “I didn’t politicise it, because it 
is a legal question, but he [Mr Murdoch] is trying to take over BSkyB, you probably 
know that ...He has minority shares ...And he wants a majority. And a majority-control 
would give him a massive stake. I have blocked it, using the powers that I have got. 
And they are legal powers that I have got. I can’t politicise it, but for the people who 
know what is happening, this is a big thing. His whole empire is now under attack. So 
there are things like that, that being in Government ...All we can do in opposition is 
protest”.

4.2 

Dr Cable did not deny making the comments but wished to explain two factors which he said 
had influenced what he had said. First, he described what had happened in his constituency 
office, and how it affected the words he chose, in this way:166

“First, on that evening there were high levels of tension in the office due to disturbances 
outside caused by a group of protestors who had tried to force entry, and were verbally 
threatening staff and residents. They were later confronted by the police. I had invited 
in a small group of protestors and had just finished a highly confrontational discussion 
with them. My own lack of concentration in the subsequent interview had a lot to do 
with this abnormal and tense environment. I volunteered strong views on the BSkyB 
takeover since that, together with university finance, was the issue uppermost in my 
mind. I should also draw attention to other comments that were made, recorded and 
reported by the journalists which caused me some embarrassment but do illustrate 
this factor further. I talked about a “big battle” going on over immigration caps, and 
“big arguments” on banks, tax thresholds, and civil liberties. I used the word “war” 
several times. These comments show how this high level of tension had spilled over 
into the language I used throughout the conversation, and not just when discussing 
one particular topic”.

1335

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I4.3 

He expanded upon this evidence orally:167

“I think it needs – in order to explain the rather emotional way in which I dealt with 
this and the very strong language, I think it is important to understand there was, I 
think, a near riot taking place outside my constituency office, people were trying to 
force entry, we had the police present trying to calm the situation. In order to prevent 
the disorder getting out of control, I invited in some of the protesters into my office. 
We had a very long discussion, very angry people upbraiding me about Afghanistan 
and Palestine and student fees and capitalism and other things, and somebody was 
waving a camcorder in my face, a few inches from my face, so I was struggling to keep 
my temper in this situation. So at the end of that interview, when I’d finally seen them 
out, I was in an extremely tense and emotional frame of mind, and the two women, 
who I thought were constituents coming to see me about a constituency problem, 
were the next people that I saw. As I’ve tried to explain here – I’m normally very calm 
in dealing with different situations – I did offload onto them a lot of pent-up feelings, 
not just about the BSkyB case that I was dealing with, but about my colleagues in 
government and a variety of other issues in language that I wouldn’t normally use, in 
what I thought was a private, confidential conversation.”

4.4 

Dr Cable next described a very different kind of influence, namely a sense that he was being 
intimidated by the threat of retribution through the newspapers owned by NI. He put it in 
these terms in his witness statement:168

“Second, the confrontational way in which my personal views of News Corporation, 
were  expressed  was  due  to  reports  coming  back  to  me  of  how  News  Corporation 
representatives  had  been  approaching  several  of  my  Liberal  Democrat  colleagues 
in a way I judged to be inappropriate. The reports suggested that News Corporation 
representatives were either trying to influence my views or seeking material which 
might be used to challenge any adverse ruling I might make, following the completion 
of  the  Ofcom  report.  These  colleagues  expressed  some  alarm  about  whether  this 
whole affair was going to lead to retribution against the Liberal Democrats through 
News International newspapers. As it happened evidence of these reports was later 
borne out in an article by Toby Helm in the Observer on 23 July 2011 (which I have 
included  in  exhibit  “VC1”).  This  added  a  sense  of  being  under  siege  from  a  well 
organised operation. Coming from a party that had hitherto been at best ignored by 
News International, this was a new and somewhat unsettling experience. I could not 
help contrast this behaviour with that of other parties to the case who were content 
to make written submissions or other cases (like Northern & Shell).
My  references  to  a  “War  on  Murdoch”  were  making  the  point,  no  doubt  rather 
hyperbolically, that I had no intention of being intimidated. Clearly, I should not have 
volunteered my unprompted opinion, even in a private, confidential conversation in a 
constituency surgery. I subsequently apologised.”

4.5 

He  developed  this  evidence  orally,  explaining  that  there  were  two  concerns  about  the 
activities of Mr Michel and others. First, he felt that the bid was being politicised. Second, 
that he and his party were being threatened with retribution:169

1336

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Well, perhaps preface my answer by saying I was describing the – the interview in 
my office took place a month after the intervention notice, and I was describing a 
series of reports I’d had from colleagues, often second or third-hand, but nonetheless 
plausible reports, of significant numbers of my Parliamentary colleagues in the Lords 
and in the Commons having had interviews with Mr Michel and possibly others, and I 
was concerned, indeed I was more than concerned, I was angry, which is what came 
out in my response, at the way this was being dealt with.
I was concerned on two levels. First, there was a systematic attempt to politicise the 
process,  to  imply  that  somehow  or  other  the  whole  process  was  governed  by  the 
Liberal Democrats, which it wasn’t, and I think in his email exchange, Jonny Oates – it 
is there, I think 1681 – does describe his own interpretation of what was going on as 
a systematic attempt by News International representatives to politicise the process. 
And secondly, and actually more seriously, I had heard directly and indirectly from 
colleagues that there had been veiled threats that if I made the wrong decision from 
their point of view of the company, my party would be – I think somebody used the 
phrase “done over” in the News International press, and I took those things seriously, 
I was very concerned. I had myself tried to deal with the process entirely properly and 
impartially,  and  I  discovered  that  this  was  happening  in  the  background.  I  frankly 
stored  up  my  anger  at  what  was  taking  place,  but  in  that  very  special  and  tense 
situation, I rather offloaded my feelings.”

4.6 

After  Dr  Cable  had  given  evidence,  a  fellow  Liberal  Democrat  MP,  Norman  Lamb,  came 
forward to the Inquiry further to explain the sense of threat. In particular, he recounted two 
meetings with Mr Michel which he said took place in Portcullis House, Westminster, on 10 
June 2010 and 27 October 2010. He described a range of subjects being recounted on both 
occasions,  including  the proposed  takeover of  BSkyB. His  recollection  of  the first meeting 
was “fairly vague”. That meeting took place five days before the bid was announced. In his 
witness statement, Mr Lamb stated that the proposed takeover had been discussed.170 In his 
oral evidence he clarified that, on that occasion, what was mentioned was a potential, not 
actual, bid.171 Mr Michel was “certain that we did not discuss the BSkyB bid at this meeting” 
because it had not been announced and he would not have mentioned it if he had been 
aware of an imminent announcement.172

4.7  Much more significantly, of the second meeting he stated:173

“During the second of these meetings – on 27 October, 2010 – Mr Michel again raised 
with  me  the  position  with  regard  to  the  proposed  takeover  of  BSkyB.  He  argued 
strongly, on the basis of the legal position, that there were no grounds for a referral. 
During the discussion he raised the issue of News International newspaper coverage 
given to the Liberal Democrats. He said he felt that the coverage since the election 
had been very fair. He specifically mentioned The Sun and indicated that it had given 
the Liberal Democrats reasonable coverage since the general election.
He then implied that if the decision surrounding the bid did not fall in their favour, it 
would be a pity if things were to change and they were no longer able to report in such

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ia positive way. I cannot remember the exact phraseology used but the message was 
very clear. I chose not to respond. I took the view that this was part of the lobbying 
operation in the run up to a decision on the bid.
I was very concerned by what I heard and reported it to Nick Clegg and also to Vince 
Cable.
We were all very clear that nothing of this sort should influence in any way how the 
bid was considered” (emphasis added).

4.8  Mr Lamb’s account of the meeting on 27 October 2010 was corroborated by a manuscript 
note which he made some time after the event: “I can’t confirm that it was definitely the 
same day, but it would have been within days of the meeting taking place”; he produced this 
for the first time on the day on which he gave his oral evidence. It was one of a number of 
notes which he had made during the early days of the coalition Government “...of interesting 
things that had happened.” and it was concisely expressed:174

“Wed 27/10
0900 meeting Fred Michel News International. An extraordinary encounter. FM is very 
charming. He tells me News Int. papers will land on VC’s desk in next 2 weeks. They 
are certain there are no grounds for referral. They realise the political pressures. He 
wants things to run smoothly. They have been supportive of Coalition. But if it goes 
the wrong way he is worried about the implications. It was brazen VC refers case to 
Ofcom – they turn nasty. Then he talked about AV – how Sun might help the debate – 
use of good graphics to get across case.
James M has met Nick – worth working on him to he could be receptive to case. Times 
will give it fair hearing.
So refer case and implication was clear. News Int turn against Coalition and AV.”

A further manuscript note evidenced Mr Lamb reporting the conversation to Mr Clegg on 2 
November 2010. Its representation of Mr Clegg’s reaction casts an interesting light on political 
perceptions of the power and conditionality of press support:175

“...He  is  horrified  by  what  I  tell  him  of  Fred  Michel’s  meeting  last  week  re  News 
International.
- we will lose the only papers who have been positive.”

4.10  Mr Michel was hoping that he might through Mr Lamb secure a meeting with Dr Cable. He 
described the meeting as “very friendly and open”176 and recalled explaining to Mr Lamb the 
growing frustration at News Corp and the sense of unfairness at not being able to make its 
case at a meeting. He explained at some length in his third witness statement what was said 
about media coverage, strongly denying that any threat was made, and positing that there 
must have been a misunderstanding: “...It seems to me that Mr Lamb has, in his own mind, 
linked various topics of conversation in a way that was certainly never intended by me....”.177

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.11  The Deputy Prime Minister recalled that Mr Lamb had spoken to him, stating:178

“At one point, I was – it was brought to my attention by Norman Lamb, a friend and 
colleague of mine, a Liberal Democrat MP, that he had been – the way he described it 
at least – told that it would be good for the Liberal Democrats to be open to the bid, 
otherwise we would expect unfavourable treatment from the Murdoch press, and 
Norman was quite agitated about that.
I have to say, since we hadn’t received particularly favourable treatment in the first 
place, I didn’t think it was a hugely credible threat, and anyway it was part of so 
many rumours and counter-rumours and claims and counterclaims that I just said 
to him, “Look, we just must not be knocked off-course from allowing this process to 
proceed in an independent, objective and quasi-judicial manner.”
And throughout all of this, I was very conscious that if I had any role at all, it was just 
to make sure that Vince Cable, as the relevant Secretary of State, was given the kind 
of time and the space to discharge his quasi-judicial functions and was insulated from 
political influence one way or the other.”

4.12  Mr Clegg did not recollect Dr Cable speaking to him about veiled threats or bullying from 

News Corp or NI.179

4.13 

I am in no doubt that Mr Lamb took what Mr Michel said on 27 October 2010 about media 
coverage  to  be  an  implied  threat  and,  given  the  impact  that  it  had  on  him,  whatever  Mr 
Michel  said  could  legitimately  have  been  understood  as  such  a  threat.  That  explains  why 
he reported it as such to both Mr Clegg and Dr Cable. However, I am prepared to accept Mr 
Michel’s evidence that, however it might have appeared and however clumsily he might have 
spoken, he was not, in fact, intending to threaten Mr Lamb or the Liberal Democrats. His 
modus operandi, which is very well evidenced in the voluminous emails and texts messages 
which he sent, as well as the evidence of others who dealt with him, tends to support his 
denial.

4.14  Mr Michel went about his work in a different way. He mounted charm offensives, flattered 
and sought to persuade others of the merits of his employer’s bid. In his internal emails, there 
is no mention or hint that he was looking for other ways to pressurise or persuade, let alone 
deploy a threat. Further, his later strategy, so far as the bid is concerned, is recorded in his 
internal emails to colleagues, already discussed, and did not involve threatening the Liberal 
Democrats. Rather, he wanted News Corp to curry favour with Dr Cable by supporting him 
and the Liberal Democrats generally. His surprise at the interpretation put upon his words 
by Mr Lamb was genuine. I am reinforced in my conclusion by Mr Clegg’s reaction that it 
was “not a hugely credible threat” and the absence of evidence that the Liberal Democrats 
were in fact “done over” by News International’s titles as a result of Dr Cable’s decision to 
intervene. It was not suggested that they were.

4.15  That the bid was discussed in politicised terms between Mr Michel and Liberal Democrat 
MPs  is  plain  and  is  evidenced  not  only  by Dr  Cable’s  recollection  but  also  by Mr Michel’s 
own reports of his lobbying efforts.180 Whether politicised discussion was in fact the result of 
a deliberate effort to politicise the decision by Mr Michel and News Corp is not at all clear. 
News Corp believed, on credible grounds, that it had a strong position on both competition

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iand plurality grounds. James Murdoch explained that the timing of the bid was deliberately 
chosen, inter alia, to avoid the issue becoming a political football before the election.181

4.16 

It is impossible to say, without further and disproportionate investigation, whether it was 
Liberal Democrat politicians, Mr Michel, or a mixture which led to the politicised conversations 
which took place. Still less is it possible to say whether that politicisation was a deliberate 
strategy or simply a failure to focus on the quasi-judicial nature of the decision and the strict 
legal test which had to be applied. What can be said with confidence though is that Dr Cable 
believed that pressure was being exerted by those whom he described as “News International 
representatives” (although actually representatives from News Corp).

4.17  The significance of the context in which the comments were made is that they consequently 
fall to be understood as Dr Cable’s unguarded and emotional reaction to his role in the bid. In 
his own words he “offloaded his feelings”. That Dr Cable’s words were of this nature is further 
made clear because he was not technically correct when he said that he had blocked the bid. 
Formally, he had only issued an intervention notice.

4.18  Context may explain Dr Cable’s comments, but, given his responsibilities, it does not excuse 
them. He did not pretend otherwise, either at the time or to the Inquiry, recognising that his 
words had given rise to an appearance of bias. He told the Inquiry:182

“No, I do understand in my case that the remarks I made did create a perception 
of bias and therefore made it difficult for me to continue. I fully understand that. It 
doesn’t mean to say I would have been biased; I wouldn’t have been. But nonetheless 
there  was  a  perception  issue  and  that  had  to  be  taken  into  account  by  the  Prime 
Minister”.

4.19  Dr Cable also rightly recognised that the transfer of responsibility for the bid was the inevitable 

result of his own words:183

“Q.  ...Do  you  have  any  observations  to  make  on  the,  as  it  were,  transfer  of 
responsibilities to another department or not?
A.  Well, I was angry with myself at what had happened, but given what you just said 
about perception of bias, I understood that there was no alternative in this case.”

4.20  His remarks, once published, made the perception or appearance of bias inevitable, as in 
due  course  was  therefore  the  removal  of  his  responsibilities.  It  is,  however,  important  to 
underline that if what he said had not been recorded by a journalist but had, in fact, been 
heard by a constituent (as he believed was the case), it is certainly possible that what he said 
could have returned to impact on the bid after he had decided it: his constituent might then 
have gone to the press. This only serves to underline the very difficult position faced by those 
charged with making judicial or quasi-judicial decisions.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIThe story breaks

4.21  The Daily Telegraph published a story about their reporters’ conversation with Dr Cable online 
on 20 December 2010184 and there was further coverage both online and on paper on 21 
December 2010. Surprisingly, the initial coverage on 20 December 2010 and the morning of 
21 December 2010 did not refer to Dr Cable’s comments about the bid. There was suspicion 
that  the  Daily  Telegraph  did  not  want  to  cause  trouble  for  a  Secretary  of  State  who  had 
made a decision to intervene which was, of course, in the interests of the Telegraph Media 
Group  (TMG).  There  can  be  little  doubt  that  the  TMG  was  not  supportive  of  the  bid  and 
that its opposition was based upon commercial grounds. Aidan Barclay, Chairman of TMG, 
subsequently wrote to James Murdoch in these terms:185

“I am sure you are aware that the Telegraph was not supportive of the News Corp 
proposed takeover of BSkyB. We took this position as a result of what we believed 
were and are genuine commercial concerns...” (emphasis added)

4.22  However, the Daily Telegraph denied that it was trying to hide the information and maintained 
that it deliberately held back parts of the transcript of the conversation in order that it could 
publish a further instalment and thereby get the maximum return on the story. Whatever 
the motive, the information did not stay out of the public domain for long. A whistleblower 
passed a full copy of the transcript to the BBC’s Robert Peston who, at 2:30 pm, published 
the passages which had been excised by the Daily Telegraph on his blog; subsequently, the 
Daily Telegraph did publish them.186 As for the motive in withholding what would have been 
the most explosive part of the story, on the basis that this sub-issue was not fully explored 
and is not essential to the narrative, I make no finding, save only to observe that if that had 
been the plan, the whistleblower (who obviously had access to the full details of the story) 
apparently did not know about it .

4.23  Before continuing with the events of 21 December 2010, it is appropriate to record that the 
use of subterfuge by the Daily Telegraph directed to Dr Cable was not an isolated incident. 
It was one of a number of instances in which undercover Daily Telegraph reporters sought 
to elicit unguarded comments from Liberal Democrat MPs. The results were the subject of 
articles on 21, 22 and 23 December 2010 and provoked a complaint to the PCC from Tim 
Farron  MP,  President  of  the  Liberal  Democrats.  The  complaint  was  upheld,  albeit  with  an 
important qualification concerning Dr Cable:187

“For  the  Commission  to  have  sanctioned  this  method,  it  would  have  had  to  be 
convinced that a high level of public interest could reasonably have been postulated 
in advance. It did not believe that the Telegraph – although acting no doubt with 
legitimate  intent  –  had  sufficient  grounds,  on  a  prima  facie  basis,  to  justify  their 
decision to send the reporters in. The complaint was therefore upheld.
The Commission did feel that the newspaper had uncovered material in the public 
interest regarding the remarks made by Vince Cable about the News Corporation bid

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ifor BSkyB, which had led to him being divested of his role in that decision. However, 
there had been no suggestion that the intention of the newspaper had been to explore 
how he had been handling the bid (it made clear in its coverage that Mr Cable [sic] 
had spoken “despite not being asked about the issue”), and the newspaper itself had 
chosen not to make it a focus of its first day’s coverage. The test for the Commission 
was whether there were grounds in the first place to justify the subterfuge: the Cable 
disclosures about Sky were not relevant to that.”

The response to the story

4.24  21 December 2010 had already been an important day for consideration of the bid. At midday, 
the  European  Commission  unconditionally  approved  the  bid  from  the  European  Union 
competition perspective.188 That news prompted communication between James Murdoch 
and Mr Hunt. The former tried to call the latter who texted at 12:46hrs:189

“Sorry to miss ur call. Am on my mobile now. Jeremy.”

4.25 

James Murdoch replied at 12:52hrs:190

“Have to run into next thing. Are you free anything after 2.15? I can shuffle after this”.

4.26  A further exchange of texts concluding at 12:56hrs agreed 16:00hrs as a convenient time to 
speak.191 At 12:57hrs, Mr Hunt texted again, by this time he had self evidently heard about 
the European Commission’s decision:192

“Great and congrats on Brussels, just Ofcom to go!”

4.27  The terms of his message were not impartial and are consistent with his broad sympathy 
for the bid which he had never hidden. It is a matter of importance, however, that the text 
message was sent before Mr Peston’s story had been posted and whilst responsibility for the 
bid still rested with Dr Cable.

4.28  News of Mr Peston’s story travelled fast. At 15:50hrs, Sue Beeby, the second of Mr Hunt’s two 
SpAds, emailed details of Dr Cable’s comments to Mr Hunt.193 Ten minutes later, at 16:00hrs, 
Mr Hunt and James Murdoch spoke by telephone, as previously arranged. James Murdoch 
was described as being “totally horrified” by the Secretary of State’s comments.194

4.29  Mr  Hunt  sought  to  consult  a  senior  Cabinet  colleague,  Mr  Osborne,  texting  at  16:08hrs: 
“Cld we chat about Murdoch Sky bid? am seriously worried we are going to screw this up. 
Jeremy”.195 He followed that with a second text also timed at 16:08hrs which read: “Just been

whole process from beginning, “Acute bias” etc”.196

4.30  He also emailed Andy Coulson at 16:10hrs asking: “Could we chat about this? Am seriously 
worried Vince will do real damage to coalition with his comments...”197 In the result, Mr Hunt 
did not think that he did speak to Mr Coulson.198 Nor did he think that he had any conversation 
with No 10 at that stage.199

4.31  By  the  time  that  Mr  Osborne  received  Mr  Hunt’s  two  text  messages  he  was  already  in  a 
16:00hrs meeting with Mr Cameron and others discussing what was to be done about Dr 
Cable’s comments.200 He probably did not see the text messages until after the meeting.201 
The meeting itself had originally been a routine meeting to review the day’s events and to 
look ahead but, in the result, it was used to react to news of Dr Cable’s comments:202

“...Every day, at 4 o’clock, there is a Prime Ministerial meeting to review what’s going 
on that day and look ahead, and I attend that meeting when I’m in London and my 
diary allows me to do so. So I was going over to Downing Street anyway. The meeting 
had, in effect, been cancelled and the meeting had become a discussion of what to do 
about Dr Cable’s remarks, and I was part of that discussion, with the Prime Minister, 
his most senior civil servant and his political advisers...”

4.32  Mr  Cameron  highlighted  the  gravity  and  urgency  of  the  situation  before  explaining  the 
thinking  which  pointed  towards  transferring  responsibility  for  the  bid  to  the  Secretary  of 
State for Culture, Media and Sport:203

“...Such a situation had the potential to damage the Government’s credibility and it 
was important to act quickly to address the issue. I had rapid discussions with my 
senior advisers, including the Permanent Secretary, as to the best way forward, as it 
was clear that Vince Cable could no longer continue in the decision-making role given 
the nature of the his comments.
I consider a range of options for how to handle this matter. I did not want to dismiss 
Vince Cable from his position as, while he had behaved inappropriately by speaking 
as  he  had  on  this  particular  issue,  he  dealt  with  many  other  issues  effectively 
as  Secretary  of  State  and  was  providing  a  valuable  contribution  to  the  Coalition 
Government. Jeremy Heywood, the Permanent Secretary at Number 10, suggested 
the option of transferring responsibility for media competition issues, including the 
option of transferring responsibility for media regulation. It seemed to me that this 
was the most logical, straightforward and effective option and it made sense for the 
policy issues of media competition and media regulation to be the responsibility of 
one department.”

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I4.33  Mr  Osborne  graphically  described  the  political  pressures  that  had  been  unleashed  by  the 

publication of Dr Cable’s unedited remarks in Mr Peston’s blog only 90 minutes earlier:204

“I think that – on the day, I remember the pressure was enormous to do something 
about  the  political  crisis  that  had  been  unleashed  on  the  government  out  of  the 
blue at 3 o’clock in the afternoon. Obviously, we had no idea that Dr Cable had said 
these things. They weren’t in the Telegraph’s report of the story that morning, which 
had itself caused some problems, and we had to deal with – I mean, the pressure 
in government, in modern government, is to – is you have to make sure you have 
answers to some the [sic] tough questions that the media are throwing at you, even if 
it comes in the middle of the afternoon, just as you’re doing other things.”

4.34  Mr Osborne recalled that the original suggestion to transfer responsibility for the bid to Mr 
Hunt  came  not  from  a  politician  but  from  (now  Sir)  Jeremy  Heywood,  then  the  Downing 
Street Permanent Secretary. He too emphasised a desire not to remove Dr Cable from his 
post altogether, expressing on his part concern about the impact that such a step might have 
had on the coalition:205

“The principal concern in the meeting – and certainly my principal concern, what I 
was seeking to say in the meeting – was that this was not something which should 
lead to the resignation of Dr Cable. I thought what Dr Cable had said was wrong but 
I didn’t think it merited his resignation, and frankly I also had concerns about the 
impact of such a resignation on the Coalition and the unity of the government.
So I was looking for a solution, as indeed were other people in the room, that did 
not involve someone else becoming the Secretary of State for Business and Dr Cable 
leaving  the  government  or  indeed  Dr  Cable  moving  to  another  portfolio,  because 
that would trigger a wider Cabinet reshuffle which was not something we felt, just 
before Christmas, with, as I say, the Coalition in its first year, something we wanted 
to see, and indeed we thought Dr Cable was doing a good job as business secretary, 
other than on this particular issue of what he’d said about the Murdochs. So we were 
looking for solutions that did not involve Dr Cable resigning or moving from business 
secretary, and Jeremy Heywood suggested the solution of moving the responsibility 
for media plurality to the department for culture, media and sport. So it was, in a 
way,  a  structural  solution  within  Whitehall  to  the  problem,  and  my  recollection  is 
once  Mr  Heywood  had  proposed  that,  we  thought  that  was  a  good  solution  and 
would help keep Dr Cable in government whilst removing from him the responsibility 
for media plurality, and it, I think, also struck us all as rather commonsensical that it 
would move to the department that was, after all, called the department for media 
and already had responsibilities for media regulation.”

4.35  By  around  16:30hrs  telephone  advice  was  being  sought  from  the  Treasury  Solicitor,  (now 
Sir) Paul Jenkins about the issue. Sir Paul, who was at home on leave, spoke to a number of 
officials, including the Cabinet Secretary, Lord O’Donnell, during the course of the next hour. 
He confirmed, from a legal perspective, the prevailing view that Dr Cable could not properly 
retain responsibility for the bid, and went further by advising against delegating the decision 
to a junior minister at BIS:206

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“...I confirmed to Sir Gus that it was my opinion that Dr Cable could no longer properly 
discharge his functions under the Enterprise Act 2000 in relation to the BSkyB bid 
because, whilst seized of the matter, he had made statements of a kind that tainted, 
irrevocably, his ability to discharge his functions in a quasi-judicial manner...
...I also advised Sir Gus that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the option of 
delegating the decision-making responsibility to a junior Minister in the Department 
for Business, Innovation and Skills would give rise to significant legal risks and this 
option was not pursued.”

4.36  Sir Paul regarded the emerging alternative candidate for the decision, Mr Hunt, as the obvious 

choice:207

“In these circumstances the obvious alternative was for the functions to be transferred 
to another Secretary of State; and the obvious Secretary of State was the Secretary of 
State for Culture, Media and Sport. I was aware from the discussions that the Prime 
Minister was considering this as the natural option”.

4.37  There was an awareness of the need to check whether responsibility for the bid could properly 
be  transferred  to  Mr  Hunt.  Accordingly,  Sir  Jeremy  contacted  the  Permanent  Secretary  at 
DCMS, Jonathan Stephens. Like Sir Paul, Mr Stephens was also at home, starting his Christmas 
leave. Mr Stephens recalled being asked whether Mr Hunt had publicly made any comment 
which might appear to have pre-judged the issue. He was only aware of what his Secretary 
of  State  had  said  on  15  June  2010,  the  day  on  which  the  bid  was  announced.  He  caused 
checks to be made by his officials and with Mr Hunt’s SpAds before passing on Mr Hunt’s 
public comments to Sir Jeremy, whom he knew to be consulting lawyers and the Cabinet 
Secretary.208

4.38  Witnesses were understandably  unable  to recollect  the precise terms in  which  Mr Hunt’s 
relevant public statements were communicated to the Treasury Solicitor, who was asked to 
advise. For his part, Sir Paul put it this way:209

“I was provided with the gist of the comments made by Jeremy Hunt by Sir Gus over 
the telephone. I have now seen the comments attributed to Jeremy Hunt collected at 
paragraph 172 of the Prime Minister’s statement. I believe that the gist as relayed to 
me fairly summarised the content of those comments”.

4.39  The comments to which Sir Paul was referring to in the quotation above, as set out in Mr 

Cameron’s witness statement, are these:210

“a.  An interview in the Financial Times, published on 16 June 2010, where he was 
quoted as saying:
It does seem to me that News Corp do control Sky already, so it isn’t clear to me that 
in terms of media plurality there is a substantive change, but I don’t want to second 
guess what regulators might decide.”
b.  An interview in Broadcast magazine where he was also quoted as saying:

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid IRather than worrying about Rupert Murdoch owning another TV channel, what we 
should recognise is that he has probably done more to create variety and choice in 
British TV than any other single person.
c.  The description of Jeremy Hunt in the same Broadcast magazine article, which was 
displayed on his constituency website, as:
like all good Conservatives Hunt is a cheerleader for Rupert Murdoch’s contribution to 
the health of British television.”

4.40  Sir Paul did not consider that these matters precluded Mr Hunt from taking over Dr Cable’s 
decision making function in relation to the bid and advised the Cabinet Secretary accordingly. 
His reasons were recorded in a note produced by Lord O’Donnell for Mr Cameron the next 
day. In his evidence Sir Paul explained:211

“...I  took  the  view  that  senior  politicians  in  the  office  of  Secretary  of  State  should 
be credited with the ability to put aside such personal views, expressed before their 
holding of a decision-making power, so that they can approach the decision-making 
process, on advice and with a fresh mind. I did not think that Jeremy Hunt’s comments 
were of a nature that indicated that they could not be put aside; nor that a reasonable 
and informed person would conclude that they could not be put aside. I acknowledge 
that there will be occasions when a politician does make such a comment but I do not 
think this was one”.

4.41  Sir Paul’s advice was accepted and cemented the provisional decision to transfer Dr Cable’s 

functions in relation to the bid from BIS to DCMS and Mr Hunt.

4.42  Meanwhile, at 16:58hrs, after the meeting in Downing Street, but whilst legal advice was still 
being taken, Mr Osborne replied to Mr Hunt’s earlier text messages by referring to the then 
still provisional decision to transfer responsibility for the bid to Mr Hunt: “I hope you like the 
solution!”212

4.43  By the time he received Mr Osborne’s text, Mr Hunt knew something of what was happening 
and, in particular, that Downing Street was checking whether public comments sympathetic 
to the bid were an obstacle to his assuming responsibility for the bid.213 Not only were these 
comments  being  considered  by  the  Cabinet  Secretary  and  Treasury  Solicitor,  they  were 
also scrutinised by the Legal Director at DCMS, Patrick Kilgarriff. Mr Kilgarriff’s views on the 
comments about the bid made by the Secretary of State on 15 June 2010 were recorded in 
an internal email which Mr Hunt forwarded to Ed Llewellyn, the Downing Street Chief of Staff 
at 17:30hrs.

4.44 

It is clear from the terms in which Mr Kilgarriff couched his email that whilst he did not think 
Mr Hunt’s comments precluded him from making a decision about the bid, he did foresee 
that they might prove to be controversial and the subject of challenge. Consequently, he was

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIalive to the fact that a carefully reasoned decision, based on the all the relevant evidence 
was going to be needed. He rightly foresaw the need for particular care. He put it this way:214

“When did JH say it? I assume it was shortly after News Int announced its intention 
to  buy  out  the  other  shareholders  in  Sky.  Therefore  at  a  time  when  JH  was  not 
responsible for policy in this area. If so, it is not helpful and tends towards an element 
of pre-judging the issue. That said, the view is far from definitive as is demonstrated 
by the wish not to second guess decision making by regulator and “it isn’t clear to 
me” so unhelpful and enough to draw comment and perhaps challenge but probably 
not fatal when a well reasoned decision is made with conclusions based on all the 
relevant evidence” (emphasis added).

4.45 

It was common ground that the only comments sought and then put to the Treasury Solicitor 
for consideration and advice were public comments made by Mr Hunt. Sir Paul was not aware, 
when he advised, that in fact Mr Hunt had sent a memorandum detailing his views about 
the bid to the Prime Minister’s office on 19 November 2010 and another earlier memo had 
touched upon the subject on 18 June 2010. Nor was Sir Paul aware that Mr Hunt had spoken 
to James Murdoch on 21 December 2010 and had, only hours before responsibility for the bid 
had been transferred to him, congratulated James Murdoch by text on the bid’s clearance by 
the European competition authorities.

4.46  Both of the memoranda were updates of a sort which had been encouraged by Mr Cameron 
from all of his Front Bench since his days in Opposition.215 Reference to the bid in the June 
2011 memorandum was of a passing nature but had prophetically recognised the bid as a 
political elephant trap:216

“I  have  met  or  spoken  to  most  of  the  big  media  owners  –  Michael  Lyons  /  Mark 
Thompson, [sic] James Murdoch, Archie Norman / Adam Crozier. Following a steer by 
Nick Clegg, I am sending signals publicly and privately that our rhetoric will be more 
generous to the BBC than it was in opposition. But the issues that matter to our own 
supporters – BBC salaries and profligate use of licence fee money – will be sortable 
when we have the licence fee negotiations next year. I steered clear of commenting 
on News Corp’s plans to buy out the 61% of Sky they do not own on the grounds it 
was a competition issue for regulators and not for ministers – but there are likely to 
be further elephant traps in the media landscape which we must be careful to avoid.” 
(emphasis added)

4.47  The  second  note  leaves  Mr  Hunt’s  sympathetic  views  about  the  bid,  and  the  reasons  for 
them, in no doubt. Crucially, there was nevertheless a very clear recognition that approving 
the bid was not a Government issue, that the decision had to be kept at arm’s length, and 
that any meeting with Dr Cable had to be confined to policy issues and not to the decision on 
the bid:217

“A lot has been happening in my sectors so here goes with a brief update:

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid INewsCorp/Sky bid James Murdoch is pretty furious at Vince’s referral of Ofcom. He 
doesn’t think he will get a fair hearing from Ofcom. I am privately concerned about 
this because NewsCorp are very litigious and we could end up in the wrong place in 
terms of media policy. Essentially what James Murdoch wants to do is repeat what 
his father did with the move to Wapping and create the world’s first multi-platform 
media operator, available from paper to web to TV to iPhone to iPad. Isn’t this what 
all media companies have to do ultimately? And if so, we must be very careful that 
any attempt to block it is done on plurality grounds and not as a result of lobbying by 
competitors.
The UK has the chance to lead the way on this as we did in 80s [sic] with the Wapping 
move but if we block it our media sector will suffer for years. In the end I am sure 
sensible controls can be put into any merger to ensure there is plurality, but I think it 
would be totally wrong to cave in to the Mark Thompson [sic] / Channel 4 / Guardian 
line that this represents a substantial change of control given that we all know Sky is 
controlled by NewsCorp now anyway.
What  next?  Ofcom  will  issue  their  report  saying  whether  it  needs  to  go  to  the 
Competition  Commission  by  31  December.  It  would  totally  wrong  [sic]  for  the 
government to get involved in a competition issue which has to be decided at arms 
length.  However  I  do  think  you,  I,  Vince  and  the  DPM  should  meet  to  discuss  the 
policy issues that are thrown up as a result.” (emphasis added)

4.48 

It is not perhaps surprising that Mr Cameron did not remember the existence of the note 
when he was considering how to react to publication of Dr Cable’s comments on 21 December 
2010, more than a month later. Had he done so, I have no doubt that he would have asked 
for it to be considered by the Treasury Solicitor along with Mr Hunt’s public comments about 
the bid:218

“The issue here is I don’t particularly remember this note, and crucially, I didn’t recall 
its existence on the day of 21 December when we were making this decision, and I 
say that frankly. Obviously if I had recalled it, I would have fed it into the system, as 
it were, but as I’m sure we’ll come to, it’s pretty clear from the legal advice we have 
that that wouldn’t have actually made any difference to the outcome.”

4.49  Mr Cameron’s retrospective conclusion was, in fact, borne out by the Treasury Solicitor. The 
statement made by Sir Paul to the Inquiry was, indeed, that if had he known about the 19 
November 2010 memorandum, it would have made no difference to his advice:219

“I am quite clear that my advice to Sir Gus would not have been any different had I 
seen the note at the time. Jeremy Hunt appears to have been providing his personal 
opinion to the Prime Minister at a time when he had no decision-making powers in 
respect of the bid. Just as in his public statements he offers personal views on the 
plurality issues. Just as in his public statements he also acknowledges that these are 
in  effect  regulatory  issues  to  be  taken  quasi-judicially.  I  thus  do  not  think  there  is 
anything in the note to indicate that Jeremy Hunt could not have properly set aside 
his personal views and considered the bid on the basis of the evidence, advice and 
expert opinion before him once he had inherited the relevant powers.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.50 

It  is  noteworthy  that  Mr  Hunt’s  suggestion  that  there  should  be  a  meeting  between  Mr 
Cameron, Mr Clegg, himself and Dr Cable to discuss policy issues thrown up as a result of the 
bid was not acted upon, as Mr Cameron was able to confirm:220

“I do not recall responding to Jeremy Hunt’s note either in writing or by speaking to 
him about it. The meeting he suggested take place did not happen and I do not recall 
any arrangement being made for it to happen...”

4.51  Turning to Mr Hunt, he acknowledges that he did not volunteer the fact that he had been 
in contact with James Murdoch on 21 December 2010 and had congratulated him on the 
European Commission’s decision by text, nor did he raise the existence of his 19 November 
2010  memorandum.  Put  shortly,  he  did  not  think  that  they  demonstrated  any  view 
substantively different to that which he had publicly expressed:221

“ Q.  Were you asked, though, about anything which was not in the public domain, 
but which might embarrass you should it enter the public domain?
A.  No.
Q. Do you feel that such matters should have been volunteered by you?
A.  Are you talking about my memo to the Prime Minister?
Q.  Well, the memo to the Prime Minister, the conversation with Mr Murdoch and the 
text message we’ve looked at about the congratulations for Brussels, just Ofcom to 
go. It’s the accumulation of pieces of evidence. It’s that material, Mr Hunt, basically.
A.  I think that all that material is entirely consistent with the overall position that I’d 
taken that I was sympathetic to the bid and I didn’t think there was a media plurality 
issue, I didn’t think we should second-guess the regulators and I thought that due 
process should be followed.
Q.  Isn’t there a difference, though, between what was stated publicly at interview 
with the Financial Times and the sort of material we’ve been looking at? Do you see 
there as being possibly any difference?
A.  I don’t think there’s a substantive difference because substantively my position in 
all those communications is the same: I, broadly speaking, had the view that BSkyB 
was  already  controlled  by  the  Murdochs  so  I  didn’t  think  there  was  a  change  in 
plurality, but I believed that due process had to be respected, so I do not think there’s 
a particular difference.”

4.52 

It is not in the least surprising that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport had 
an opinion upon a major media issue, in this case the bid by News Corp, or that he should 
have contact with a major player in his sector of responsibility, such as James Murdoch: on 
the contrary, it would have been more surprising had he not had a view or, indeed, contact 
with Mr Murdoch. Moreover, what Mr Hunt was saying in private to Mr Murdoch and writing 
to the Prime Minister was not inconsistent with what he was putting into the public domain. 
He did, though, go into more detail, his comments were much nearer in time to the transfer 
to him of responsibility for the bid and he was more emphatic in his support for the bid in 
private. The mere fact of his private statements increased the quantity (and quality) of what 
he had said and written on the subject.

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I4.53 

4.54 

In relation to a decision which was as politically charged as this one, and a decision about the 
handling of a process which was quasi-judicial and therefore legally challengeable on grounds 
of appearance of bias, it would have been prudent for Mr Hunt to have reminded those at No 
10 of the fact of his 19 November 2010 note and to have volunteered the extent of his private 
contact with James Murdoch. The additional information, provided openly and transparently, 
could then have been taken into account and fully informed advice given.

It is not necessary for me to decide whether or not knowledge of Mr Hunt’s contact with 
James Murdoch would have made any difference to the advice given by the Treasury Solicitor. 
He has confirmed that knowledge of the note would not have made a difference and the way 
in which he explained his view makes it is reasonable to infer that he would have maintained 
that position had he also known about the private contact with James Murdoch. I accept, 
however, that this is entirely speculative and to have pressed Sir Paul to speculate further as 
to what his advice might have been ex post facto would have been unfair. More important, for 
the purposes of the Inquiry, it is entirely unnecessary because whatever the answer, the wider 
point for the future conduct of politicians (and especially those in power) remains the same. 
Ministers  must  be  especially  vigilant  in  matters  relating  to  media  policy,  especially  quasi-
judicial decisions, and indeed to any circumstance in which they are called upon to exercise 
discretion which might impact on those with whom they have or have had a relationship, 
whether working or personal. In short, they must put themselves above suspicion.

4.55  The decision which Mr Cameron made, subject to legal advice, and its timing were entirely 
understandable.  There  were  enormous  pressures  on  the  Government  to  act  quickly.  The 
media storm would only have gathered strength if decisive action had not been taken. News 
Corp  were  understandably  deeply  concerned  by  Dr  Cable’s  words  and  a  solution  which 
restored confidence in the decision making process was urgently required. There were sound 
reasons not to remove Dr Cable from office, articulated by Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne in 
evidence. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport was the obvious candidate 
to entrust with the decision because of his portfolio. Finding a suitable decision maker who 
did not have a prior view one way or another about the bid would most likely have proved 
to be a wild goose chase. Almost every leading politician has a view, one way or the other, 
about Rupert Murdoch’s companies and it is often strongly held.222 The evidence does not 
begin to support a conclusion that the choice of Mr Hunt was the product of improper media 
pressure, still less an attempt to guarantee a particular outcome to the process, a subject to 
which this Report returns following consideration of Mr Hunt’s handling of the bid.

4.56  The question of Mr Hunt’s disclosures at this point does, however, raise one further point 
of  interest.  Had  he  disclosed  the  full  extent  of  his  relevant  interactions  at  the  outset,  an 
opportunity would have arisen for those responsible for doing so to offer him more specific 
advice on the conduct of the bid process and on managing the risks of appearance of bias, 
tailored to the specifics of the circumstances. That might have made a difference, but I say 
no more than that.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.  December 2010 – July 2011: The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt 

5.1 

and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
The  delicacy  of  the  task  for  which  Mr  Hunt  assumed  responsibility  should  not  be 
underestimated. From a political perspective the decision was inherently controversial, “a hot 
potato” as the Prime Minister put it.223 From a procedural point of view, Dr Cable’s apparent 
bias had caused News Corp considerable concern about, and lack of faith in, the process up 
to this point, as is plain to see from its solicitors’ subsequent correspondence.224

5.2  Mr Hunt’s own comments about the bid, whilst not enough to prevent him from taking on 
the task, were such as to generate unease on the part of opponents to the bid. Consequently, 
as  both  Mr  Kilgarriff  and  Mr  Stephens  had  astutely  recognised,  there  was  a  need  to  take 
particular care going forward.225 Mr Hunt had to be scrupulously fair to both sides and had to 
be seen to be so. He was walking a tightrope.

5.3 

5.4 

This  Report  first  considers  the  formal  handling  of  the  bid  by  Mr  Hunt  and  DCMS  before 
separately considering the lobbying which was happening concurrently behind the scenes and 
the various unsolicited submissions and representations which were made to the Secretary 
of State.

The handover of responsibility was executed promptly. It involved the transfer of 70 or so 
staff from BIS to DCMS and a high level meeting on the morning of 22 December 2010.226 
Mr Stephens described these immediate steps, identified the main DCMS attendees at the 
meeting, and emphasised that the requirements of a quasi-judicial process were addressed 
at the meeting:227

“Given the circumstances surrounding the transfer of responsibility, I was particularly 
conscious of the need to establish robust processes to support the Secretary of State’s 
new responsibilities. I also had to oversee the immediate transfer of some 70 or so 
staff from BIS to DCMS, with their responsibilities and budgets. I identified Jon Zeff, 
then Director, Media, as the lead policy official and he ensured that the relevant BIS 
officials and lawyers were present at a meeting the next day (the 22nd December) 
with the Secretary of State. I also attended that meeting, along with Jon Zeff, a DCMS 
lawyer, and Adam Smith...
At  that  meeting  BIS  officials  briefed  the  Secretary  of  State  on  his  functions  and 
responsibilities,  the  decision  already  taken  and  the  next  steps.  In  particular  they 
reinforced the advice in the Department’s submission to the Secretary of State of 12th 
November that this was a quasi-judicial process and set out what that required...”

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I5.5  Mr Hunt was sure that the term quasi judicial was used when his role in the process was 
outlined at the meeting. He had not himself exercised a quasi judicial role before.228 But he 
was well aware of the sensitivities:229

“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: [I]t was abundantly clear to you, wasn’t it that enormous 
care had to be exercised? One of the things in the note from BIS was a reference 
to  the  fact  that  the  Secretary  of  State  for  BERR  –  the  decision  to  intervene  in  the 
Lloyds HBOS merger [-] was judicially reviewed on the basis that his discretion had 
been fettered by comments by the Chancellor, so great sensitivity around all these 
decisions?

A.  Absolutely right.”

5.6 

The OFT and Ofcom reports
The  OFT  reported  to  Mr  Hunt  on  30  December  2010,  predictably  concluding  that  the 
proposed transaction, if executed, would constitute a European relevant merger situation. 
This formally confirmed that the Secretary of State did have jurisdiction to make a reference 
to  the  Competition  Commission  under  Article  5(3)  of  the  Enterprise  Act  (Protection  of 
Legitimate Interests) Order 2003 (“the 2003 Order”) to address any media plurality concerns 
if he believed that the relevant statutory conditions were satisfied.230

5.7 

The following day, Ofcom delivered its keenly anticipated report on plurality, recommending 
a fuller second stage review by the Competition Commission.231 Ofcom put its advice and 
conclusion in this way:232

“Ofcom’s  advice,  based  on  the  evidence  and  reasons  set  out  in  this  report  and 
summarised in the executive summary, is that it may be the case that the proposed 
acquisition may be expected to operate against the public interest since there may 
not be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of media enterprises providing 
news and current affairs to UK-wide cross-media audiences. In reaching this view we 
do not rely on the dynamic effects discussed in full in Section 6.
Therefore we believe there is a need for a fuller second stage review of these issues 
by the Competition Commission to assess the extent to which the concentration in 
media ownership may act against the public interest, and we advise the Secretary of 
State accordingly.”

5.8 

Ofcom’s work had drawn into focus a wider issue concerning the adequacy of the regulatory 
framework  and  in  particular  the  lack  of  a  mechanism  with  which  to  address  a  threat  to 
plurality arising from the organic growth of a company. Whilst this lacuna was not immediately 
relevant to the bid, the recommendation is highly relevant to the Terms of Reference and

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIis further analysed below.233 For present purposes it is sufficient to note and endorse the 
recommendation which Ofcom made in Chapter 7 of its report:234

“Under  the  current  statutory  framework,  a  media  public  interest  consideration  of 
plurality  can  only  be  triggered  when  there  is  a  proposed  merger  involving  media 
enterprises.  The  future  market  developments  considered  in  this  report  suggest 
that  the  current  statutory  framework  may  no  longer  be  fully  equipped  to  achieve 
Parliament’s objective of ensuring sufficient plurality of media ownership.
The market developments identified include the risk of market exit by current news 
providers, or a steady organic growth in audience shares and increase in ability to 
influence by any one provider. For example, in a situation where a company grows 
organically through entirely legitimate business strategy which does not involve any 
anti-competitive behaviour but finds  itself  in  the relevant media market with  90% 
share  of  audiences.  While  this  may  not  have  raised  competition  concerns,  it  very 
clearly may raise plurality concerns.
While there is a clear statutory framework for remedying competition concerns which 
may  arise  in  the  context  of  a  merger,  the  same  is  not  true  of  concerns  related  to 
plurality  more  generally.  This  means  that  if  a  transaction  is  found  not  to  operate 
against the public interest in relation to plurality at the time, there is no subsequent 
opportunity  or  mechanism  to  address  or  even  to  consider  any  plurality  concerns 
which develop over time.
...
We therefore also recommend that the Government consider undertaking a wider 
review of the statutory framework to ensure plurality in the public interest. Specifically, 
we believe there may be value in providing for intervention where plurality concerns 
arise in the absence of a corporate transaction involving media enterprises and which 
are not safeguarded by the current media ownership rules.” (emphasis added)

Procedural arrangements and meetings with James Murdoch

5.9  Mr Hunt’s formal task, having received the above reports, was to decide whether or not to 
refer the proposed transaction to the Competition Commission. The applicable test was (and 
is) that provided by article 5(3) of the 2003 Order which states:

“3)  The Secretary of State may make a reference to the Commission if he believes 
that it is or may be the case that –
(a)  arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, 
will result in the creation of a European relevant merger situation;
(b)  one or more than one public interest consideration mentioned in the European 
intervention notice is relevant to a consideration of the European relevant merger 
situation concerned; and
(c)  taking account only of the relevant public interest consideration or considerations 
concerned, the creation of  that  situation  operates or may  be expected to  operate 
against the public interest.”

1353

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I5.10  As is the case at the intervention stage, the test at the referral stage contains a discretion. 
The discretion allows a low threshold for intervention. Mr Hunt was bound by article 5(5) 
of the 2003 Order to accept the decision of the OFT on jurisdiction which, in any event, was 
uncontroversial. That disposed of the consideration under article 5(3)(a) of the test. In effect 
it remained for him to decide whether or not to follow Ofcom’s recommendation to refer the 
bid to the Competition Commission in this case.

5.11  Before  addressing  the  substantive  decision,  Mr  Hunt  had  first  to  consider  procedure.  In 
particular, Allen & Overy, solicitors acting on behalf of News Corp, had lost no time in writing 
to him on 23 December 2010, complaining in strong terms about his predecessor’s handling 
of the matter and requesting to know how Mr Hunt intended to proceed.235 DCMS replied 
promising a redacted copy of Ofcom’s report when it was available and assuring News Corp 
that it would be given: “reasonable opportunity to make written and oral representations 
before the Secretary of State takes his decision...”236

5.12  Allen & Overy wrote again on 5 January 2011 pressing for progress and expressing fears about 
how long the process might take.237 By this time The Treasury Solicitor (TSol) was acting for 
the  Secretary  of  State  and  replied,  explaining  that  he  did  not  wish  to  delay  the  decision, 
and that Mr Hunt was prepared to meet News Corp.238 It is entirely understandable, in the 
exceptional circumstances that the bid had come to him, that Mr Hunt should have done so.

5.13  The meeting with News Corp took place on 6 January 2011. Mr Hunt had conferred with 
his  officials  and  legal  advisers  the  previous  day  in  preparation,  and  an  aide  memoire  was 
prepared  for  him.239  The  Secretary  of  State  was  accompanied  at  the  meeting  by  Mr  Zeff, 
Mr Kilgarriff, Adam Smith and his Private Secretary. News Corp was represented by James 
Murdoch, Mr Michel and others. A detailed note was taken and it was expressly recorded 
that those present would be open about the fact of the meeting:240

“It was agreed that subject [sic] of these discussions would be kept confidential at 
this stage but both sides would be open about the fact meetings that [sic] had taken 
place. It was expected that the OFCOM and any News Corp submissions would be 
released no later than the SoS’ decision on referral.”

5.14  According  to  the  minute  Mr  Hunt  broke  the  news  at  the  meeting  that  he  was  minded  to 
refer  the  proposed  transaction  to  the  Competition  Commission,  explaining  that  Ofcom’s 
recommendation, together with advice which he had received from counsel, had caused him 
to reach this provisional view. He referred to the “very low” threshold set by the statutory 
test. A redacted copy of the Ofcom report was to be provided to News Corp the following day 
and the company was to have a week to make written submissions, if it so wished, before 
Mr Hunt made a final decision. These submissions were not to be a re-submission of News 
Corp’s evidence to Ofcom. If, as a result of such submissions, or certain clarifications which 
Mr Hunt wished to seek from Ofcom, Mr Hunt became minded not to refer the deal then 
other interested parties would be given the opportunity to state their cases.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.15  Amongst a number of points, News Corp expressed serious concerns about Ofcom’s work, 
and warned that the practical effect of a referral would be to decrease the likelihood of the 
sale being completed and reserved its legal rights. Those speaking on behalf of the company 
also made clear its fallback position, which was that a further meeting would be sought if its 
written submissions were not successful, in order to discuss those submissions and potential 
remedies as necessary. By remedies News Corp was referring to undertakings in lieu of referral 
(“UIL”) which the Secretary of State has the power to accept under the Enterprise Act:241

“The Secretary of State may, instead of making such a reference and for the purpose 
of  remedying,  mitigating  or  preventing  any  of  the  effects  adverse  to  the  public 
interest which have or may have resulted, or which may be expected to result, from 
the creation of the European relevant merger situation concerned accept from such of 
the parties concerned as she considers appropriate undertakings to take such action 
as he considers appropriate.”

5.16  The  terms  of  the  Departmental  aide  memoire,  which  are  realistic,  give  an  insight  in  to 
the thinking in DCMS; it suggests that Mr Hunt was not going to be easily moved from his 
provisional view but that he was open to a further meeting to discuss any written submissions 
which News Corp might produce:242

“I have carefully read the Ofcom report and I find it very difficult on the basis of what 
I have seen to date to see any grounds which would allow me to not refer this case 
to the Competition Commission, especially given that the threshold for referring is 
relatively low.
...
I will consider carefully any arguments you subsequently put to me and would be 
happy to have a further meeting on the substance of the report. But my feeling at 
this stage is that that [sic] you will have to identify some very serious flaws in Ofcom’s 
facts or analysis before I could consider not referring...” (original underlining)

5.17  Formal “minded to” letters were sent by Mr Hunt to both News Corp and BSkyB on 7 January 
2011 enclosing both the OFT report and a redacted version of Ofcom’s report. The letters 
explained that the Secretary of State was minded to refer the matter but, as is required by 
the Enterprise Act 2002,243 consulted the relevant parties likely to be adversely affected by 
the decision if it was confirmed. In this case the letters did so by inviting written submissions 
and offering a meeting.244

5.18  On 10 January 2012, Mr Hunt, Mr Smith and officials met Ed Richards, the CEO of Ofcom. This 

was to seek clarification on various aspects of the Ofcom report.245

5.19  On  13  January  2011,  BSkyB  made  detailed  written  submissions  to  the  Secretary  of  State, 
urging  him  to  reject  Ofcom’s  advice  and  to  permit  the  transaction  to  complete  without  a 
referral.246  These  submissions  were  followed  very  shortly  afterwards  by  those  of  Allen  & 
Overy, on behalf of News Corp, which were delivered on 14 January 2011 in both confidential

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iand redacted format. Their very detailed submissions amounted to a sustained full frontal 
attack on the Ofcom report, tantamount to an allegation of bias:247

“News [sic] believes that Ofcom has failed to approach the effects of this Transaction 
with  an  open  mind  and  has  carried  out  a  review  process  with  the  intention  of 
identifying concerns. Ofcom has been noticeably more receptive to submissions made 
by third party complainants than it has been to submissions made by News and has 
chosen to present the evidence in a one sided way (in some cases selectively omitting 
relevant evidence)”.

5.20  Conspicuously,  the  submissions  did  not  conclude  by  throwing  down  the  gauntlet  to  the 
Secretary of State, although they were careful to preserve News Corp’s legal position. Instead 
they culminated by indicating a willingness on the part of News Corp to give UIL which would 
“remedy, mitigate or prevent all of the effects adverse to the public interest which Ofcom 
erroneously identifies may result from the Transaction”.248 It was on this potential alternative 
to a referral which News Corp thereafter focused its effort, following up its submissions of 14 
January 2011 with draft UIL under cover of a letter dated 18 January 2011.249

5.21  News  Corp’s  proposal  was  to  “spin  off”  Sky  News  as  an  independent  company  so  as  to 
guarantee  its  continued  editorial  independence  and  to  commit  to  a  long  term  carriage 
agreement so as to ensure the commercial viability of the hived off entity. The arrangements 
were summarised by Allen & Overy in a covering letter expressed in these terms:250

“The attached UIL proposal involves a commitment from News that Sky News will 
be spun off as an independent UK public limited company (Newco), with its shares 
publicly traded. Shares in Newco would be distributed to the existing shareholders of 
Sky, as far as possible, in the same proportions as their existing shareholding (so that 
News will retain only the same shareholding in Sky News as it currently has in Sky, 
39.1%).
The  corporate  governance  structure  of  Newco  will  also  replicate  the  effect  of  the 
existing governance structure of Sky, which has been in place for a number of years. 
In particular, after closing:

(a) The voting agreement dated 21 September 2005 between the Sky [sic] and 
News which prevents News from exercising more than 37.19% of the votes will 
be replicated in respect of Newco;

(b) a  majority  of  the  board  of  Newco  shall  comprise  non-executive  Directors 

determined by the board to be independent;

(c)  material transactions between Newco and News/Sky will require the approval 
of  Newco’s  Audit  Committee,  which  will  consist  exclusively  of  independent 
non-executive  Directors.  In  addition  Newco’s  constitutional  documents  will 
provide  that  such  transactions  may,  depending  on  materiality,  require  an 
independent fairness opinion or Newco independent shareholder approval (by 
virtue of Newco applying controls that have equivalent effect to those imposed 
by Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules).

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIThere  will  also  be  a  number  of  commercial  agreements  between  News/Sky  and 
Newco,  including  a  long-term  carriage  agreement  which  will  provide  Newco  with 
a  significant  and  committed  long  term  revenue  stream.  None  of  the  commercial 
agreements between News/Sky and Newco will give News /Sky any right to influence 
the editorial content of Sky News.
A business plan for Sky News and a latter from News’ financial advisers regarding 
the  suitability  of  Sky  News  for  admission  to  trading  will  be  made  available  to  the 
Secretary of State in due course.”

5.22  The thinking behind the proposal was that by preserving a separate legal identity for Sky News 
and by safeguarding its editorial freedom, Ofcom’s plurality concerns would be sufficiently 
addressed. Allen & Overy argued:251

“Ofcom states in paragraph 5.46 of the Report that: “As a result, today [Sky News] 
makes a strong and positive contribution to plurality. [...] The proposed transaction 
would result in Sky ceasing to be a distinct media enterprise from News Corp.” The 
attached UIL proposal, under which Sky News would be spun off as an independent 
legal entity, will fully safeguard the status quo as regards the editorial independence 
of Sky News and will ensure that Sky News remains as a distinct media enterprise and 
independent  broadcast  voice.  This  fully  addresses  all  of  the  concerns  identified  by 
Ofcom in its Report and relied upon by Ofcom in recommending to the Secretary of 
State that he refer the Transaction to the CC.
The UIL will  therefore remedy, mitigate or prevent any purported effects resulting 
from the Transaction which have been identified by Ofcom as potentially adverse to 
the public interest.”

5.23  Mr Hunt’s initial reaction was that the UIL was: “...a pretty big offer. I mean they were basically 
saying – this was a decision I had about news plurality, and they were saying that they would 
exclude the one news organisation that’s part of BSkyB from the whole deal.”252

5.24  On  20  January  2011,  a  second  high  level  meeting  between  Mr  Hunt  and  James  Murdoch 
took  place  to  enable  News  Corp  to  expand  upon  its  written  submissions  and  to  speak  to 
its proposed UIL. Both parties took the meeting very seriously. Mr Hunt was accompanied 
by a number of DCMS officials, independent specialist counsel, and both of his SpAds. Mr 
Murdoch brought Mr Michel and others. At the outset Mr Hunt explained that he was still 
minded  to  refer  the  case  to  the  Competition  Commission,  notwithstanding  News  Corp’s 
written submissions. He maintained that the low threshold for referral combined with the 
clear  disagreement  between  Ofcom  and  News  Corp  was  leading  him  to  the  view  that  a 
referral for further investigation was the reasonable approach. He would though be prepared 
to consider UIL as an alternative to referring the matter.

5.25  Undeterred by Mr Hunt’s clear indication that he was minded to refer, the minutes show 
that News Corp maintained its furious rebuttal of the Ofcom report with a lengthy series of 
points, although there is no indication that they moved Mr Hunt from his provisional view. 
The Secretary of State was much more receptive in principle to the UIL, which were discussed 
next, but he was not prepared to be rushed when it came to the detail. He concluded that:

1357

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I “...he was prepared to explore the proposal but would want to look very closely at the 
detail, including the implications for financial viability of an independent Sky News.”253

5.26  Next steps were outlined. They involved publication of redacted versions of the Ofcom report 
and  of  News  Corp’s  written  submissions.  Mr  Hunt  would  announce  that  he  was  minded 
to refer the bid to the Competition Commission but that he was first going to explore the 
potential remedy offered by News Corp. Mr Hunt would start this process by reverting both 
to Ofcom and the OFT for further advice. The involvement of these regulatory bodies at every 
turn, even when not required by statute, was to become the hallmark of Mr Hunt’s formal 
approach to the bid. An undertaking that the representations and UIL reflected the position 
of BSkyB was sought together with fully worked up UIL. The Secretary of State made it clear 
that in the event that he was minded to accept the UIL, there would be a statutory public 
consultation.

5.27  Mr Hunt described Mr Murdoch as “very cross” about the continued involvement of Ofcom 
because “...he considered that was tantamount to wanting to kill the deal, because he believed 
that Ofcom would use every mechanism at their disposal ...”.254 It is certainly the case that this 
was one of a number of steps which Mr Hunt took during the process which were not to News 
Corp’s liking.

5.28  At a meeting between lawyers on 21 January 2011, Allen & Overy advanced arguments which 
appear to have been designed to reduce the role of OFT and Ofcom, or even to dissuade the 
Secretary of State from reverting to them. The firm also argued that early publication of the 
Ofcom report would harm the process. These arguments, although properly made, were not 
accepted and are mentioned because they are illustrative of the procedural history and the 
careful approach of DCMS and its advisers in relation to News Corp.255

Consideration of the proposed UIL: advice and consultation

5.29  Fully worked up draft UIL were provided by News Corp on 24 January 2011 and the next day 
Mr Hunt made a written statement to Parliament explaining the timeline and process which 
he had followed up to that point, as well as making public the fact that he was minded to refer 
the bid to the Competition Commission but was first considering the UIL offered by News Corp. 
His meetings with News Corp and Ofcom were covered and the statement was accompanied 
by publication of the December reports from OFT and Ofcom, the latter in redacted form, the 
Secretary of State’s “minded to” letters and the resulting submissions from both BSkyB and 
News Corp (in redacted form). On their face, the written ministerial statement and associated 
press release appeared to be models of transparency. But, as is explored further below, there 
had in fact been a considerable volume of private communication with News Corp going on 
behind the scenes which is not mentioned in the statement.256

5.30  Formal letters were sent by Mr Hunt both to Ofcom and the OFT on 27 January 2011. Ofcom 
was asked, pursuant to s106B Enterprise Act 2002, “...for advice on the extent to which you 
think that the enclosed News Corp undertakings in lieu (UIL) address the potential impact

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIon media plurality identified in Ofcom’s report...”257 The OFT was asked, pursuant to s93 of 
the same Act, “...to consult both merging parties with a view to discovering whether those 
undertakings are in your view practically and financially viable, so that they would be acceptable 
to me...”.258 The day before these letters were sent, Operation Weeting commenced. At that 
stage, Mr Hunt regarded phone hacking at News International as having no bearing on his 
consideration of News Corp’s bid. He said in evidence “...my perspective at this point is: this 
is a police matter”.259

5.31  Both  regulators  were  asked  to  respond  within  14  days  and  both  met  that  deadline  with 
responses dated 11 February 2011. Ofcom recognised the proposed UIL as a significant step 
by News Corp and regarded UIL, in principle, as a solution to its plurality concerns. However, 
it did not consider that the UIL proposed by News Corp afforded sufficiently tight governance 
arrangements to meet those concerns and it outlined four governance requirements which 
it felt had to be met:260

“The  Board  of  Newco  should  consist  of  a  majority  of  independent  directors, 
“independent  directors”  being  directors  who  have  no  other  News  Corporation  or 
News Corporation associated interest;
The Board of Newco, including the independent non executive directors, should have 
a combination of both senior editorial and business experience/expertise;
The Chairman of Newco, should be an independent non executive;
There  should  be  a  sub-committee  of  the  Board  of  Newco  to  oversee  editorial 
independence and integrity of Newco’s services (“the Board Editorial Committee”).”

5.32  Ofcom had been in contact with News Corp which had responded to Ofcom in terms indicating 
a willingness to meet the first two concerns and proposing an alternative solution in respect 
of the fourth: an alternative which was described by Ofcom as “a promising basis from which 
to work”.261 The sticking point was the third of the points listed above, the requirement for an 
independent Chairman. On that point, Ofcom’s advice was:262

“Without such an undertaking, it would be open to the Newco Board to appoint a 
Chairman who is affiliated with News Corporation. Given the nature of Newco and 
its  relationship  with  News  Corporation  as  set  out  above,  we  consider  this  would 
undermine the effectiveness of the proposed UIL in meeting our plurality concerns 
and the credibility of the undertakings.”

5.33  The OFT set out a number of additional undertakings which it considered that it would be 
necessary for News Corp to give in order to ensure that the UIL were practical and viable in 
the short to medium term. It also identified an “essential structural limitation” in that the 
carriage agreement at the heart of the scheme was of finite duration, warning that: “The OFT, 
however, considers that the finite duration of the carriage agreement, in particular, entails

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ia material risk to the long term viability of Newco and hence the UIL.”263 Ofcom appears to 
have been less concerned about this factor, considering the proposed ten year duration for 
the carriage agreement to be long term in the context of the industry dynamics of the media 
sector.264 Otherwise Ofcom did not have anything to add to the OFT’s assessment.

5.34  DCMS officials advised Mr Hunt to permit more time to see whether News Corp was prepared 
to amend its UIL so as to meet the regulators’ concerns.265 Mr Hunt did so but set News Corp 
a very tight deadline of 24 hours in which to indicate in principle that it would make the 
necessary changes.266 It amounted to an ultimatum, the core part of which was worded in 
the following terms:267

“There are therefore four critical matters which need to be resolved if I am to consider 
accepting your undertakings:
The Board of Newco would need to be independently chaired. I agree with Ofcom’s 
assessment  that,  without  such  an  undertaking,  the  Newco  Board  could  appoint  a 
Chairman who is affiliated with News Corporation which would undermine the spirit 
and  potentially  the  practical  effect  of  undertakings  designed  to  address  concerns 
about plurality.
There needs to be a non-reacquisition commitment as set out by the OFT. Whilst I 
understand that it is proposed that this could lapse after 10 years, I quite understand 
the OFT’s concern that there should not be a “carve-out” in the event of a third party 
bid for Newco.
The key contracts would need to be approved by me. At a minimum this would cover 
the carriage agreement and the brand licensing agreement. I would anticipate asking 
Ofcom and the OFT to advise me on these contracts at the appropriate time.
There needs to be more clarity around the definition of “material transactions” (as 
identified in para 8.11 of the OFT report) and the assets to be transferred (paragraph 
9.7 – 9.14).
There  are  also  a  number  of  other  important  issues  where  there  is  agreement  in 
principle, or a large measure of agreement, and these too would need to be agreed 
and incorporated into the undertakings in lieu.
If  you  are  unwilling  to  agree  to  the  necessary  changes,  I  will  refer  the  merger  to 
the Competition Commission. If, on the other hand, you will accept that in principle 
these changes can be made, and confirm that to me within 24 hours, I will formally 
ask Ofcom and the OFT to continue their discussions with News Corp with a view 
to producing as soon as possible a set of finalised undertakings in lieu which I can 
consider. If I then propose to accept those finalised undertakings in lieu of a reference, 
they can then be published and consulted on as the legislation requires.”

5.35  The consequences for News Corp, and James Murdoch personally, of accepting these further 

restrictions were not insignificant as Mr Hunt explained to the Inquiry:268

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Q.  In other words, [the Chairman of Newco] wouldn’t be Mr James Murdoch?
A.  That was a very, very significant thing for Mr Murdoch. I mean you know, News 
Corporation thinks that one of its primary functions is what it says on the tin, is news. 
He first of all didn’t think he should have to spin off Sky News at all because he didn’t 
believe  there  was  a  plurality  issue  with  the  original  proposal,  and  this  was  going 
to cost him hundreds of millions of pounds more; but secondly, he was at the time 
chairman of BSkyB, and that included being chairman of Sky News, and he thought he 
would – he wanted to continue to be chairman. I think that was pretty important to 
him. And Ofcom did not want that, and so they – so that was then presented to me.
There were other things that Ofcom – there were other concerns. There was a concern 
that  they  wanted  to  have  very  strict  measures  in  place  to  stop  News  Corporation 
buying additional shares above 39 per cent. James Murdoch was very concerned, for 
example, that a commercial rival would come in and purchase the other 61 per cent 
of the shares and that might mean that he lost control of Sky News forever...”

5.36  The short deadline prompted a swift response from James Murdoch who indicated by letter 
dated 16 February 2011 that News Corp was willing to agree to the suggested changes and 
enclosed draft amended UIL.269 This assent caused Mr Hunt formally to write to both OFT and 
Ofcom on 17 February 2011 asking them to agree a set of undertakings with News Corp and 
Sky so that he could make a final decision.270

5.37  On 1 March 2011 the OFT reported back to the Secretary of State communicating the news 
that satisfactory amendments had been proposed and enclosing draft UIL bearing the same 
date.271 Its conclusions were expressed in these terms:272

“In light of the amendments proposed by News, and subject to prior approval of the 
key agreements, as described above, the OFT advises the Secretary of State that the 
Revised UIL are likely to be practically and financially viable in the short and medium 
term (that is, no more than 10 years).
The OFT also advises the Secretary of State that the amendments made to the Revised 
UIL do not address the essential structural limitation identified in the Report, that the 
UIL offered are unlikely to be practically and financially viable over the long term. 
The relevance of this  limitation  ultimately depends on the time horizon which  the 
Secretary of State, advised by Ofcom, considers relevant to ensure the effectiveness 
of the UIL in addressing any media plurality concerns. The OFT notes that Ofcom’s 
advice of 11 February 2011 sets out its views on the dynamics of the industry.”

5.38  The same day Ofcom expressed its view that the revised proposed undertakings did address 
the concerns which it had expressed in its 31 December 2010 report. Ofcom had also seen 
the latest report from the OFT and expressed its agreement with it.273

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I5.39  Accepting  the  advice,  Mr  Hunt  proceeded  to  the  next  step  which  was  to  announce,  on  3 
March 2011, a statutory consultation exercise soliciting views as to whether the proposed 
UIL were sufficient to remedy, mitigate or prevent the public interest concerns in relation to 
media plurality raised by the merger. The Notice of Consultation allowed until 21 March 2011 
for responses.274

5.40  There was an enormous response to the consultation exercise from an extraordinary variety 
of respondents. Solicitors Slaughter and May, who had been in regular correspondence with 
DCMS  about  the  bid  before  having  this  formal  opportunity  to  make  submissions,  lodged 
detailed submissions on behalf of the Alliance.275 BT, despite itself being a part of the Alliance 
made an individual submission. Lord Prescott and Tom Watson MP separately wrote to urge 
the Secretary of State to act upon the emerging evidence of criminal wrongdoing at the News 
of the World (NoTW), a theme which was to take on a growing significance in relation to 
the bid. They were amongst around 140 MPs who wrote to DCMS. The trade unions BECTU 
and  the  NUJ  both  responded,  as  did  the  TUC.  Academics  and  individuals  and  companies 
from  within  the  media  industry  added  their  voice,  as  did  significant  numbers  of  ordinary 
members of the public. Organised email campaigns instigated by pressure groups Avaaz and 
38 Degrees resulted in tens of thousands of responses. Solicitors DLA Piper, acting for Avaaz, 
made detailed written submissions. Other not-for-profit or campaigning organisations also 
responded.  The  consultation  even  elicited  a  number  of  responses  from  the  United  States 
of America written by those who were unhappy with News Corp’s activities in that country. 
When the consultation period ended, DCMS had received 38,687 responses, of which about 
37,700  were  the  product  of  the  internet  campaigning.276  Most  were  hostile  to  the  UIL.277 
By the time the response to the consultation was announced, the number had grown still 
further.

5.41  Whilst the consultation was taking place, Mr Hunt and his officials were thinking ahead and, 
in particular, considering how best to meet key opponents of the bid. The internal e-mail of 
an official on 14 March 2011 recorded his thinking:278

“Many thanks for briefing SoS this morning on the Newscorp/BSkyB merger.
On the consultation and the process of analysing the responses, SoS was clear that 
we should take the necessary time to examine the substantive points raised about 
the UIL. His priority was to ensure that the final UIL are robust and viable in the long 
term. We must take care to avoid possible loop holes.
[On] meetings, SoS wanted to be, and be seen to be, even handed with both proponents 
and opponents of the merger. To that end SoS agreed he would consider requests for 
meetings once written evidence had been submitted. In particular, SoS wanted the 
alliance of bodies working through Slaughter and May to be aware of this position 
and his willingness to meet, given the representations they have made throughout 
this process.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.42  Mr Hunt continued to make maximum use of the assistance available to him from Ofcom and 
the OFT writing to both on 18 March 2011, before the consultation had closed. He sought their 
advice on those responses which were material to the practical and financial viability of the 
proposed UIL, enclosing some at that juncture. The remaining material representations and 
a summary of all consultation responses were to follow. Mr Hunt also sought the regulators’ 
advice in relation to the detailed provisions on carriage, brand licensing and certain operation 
agreements set out in the proposed UIL which were later provided by News Corp.279

5.43  On 24 March 2011, the Secretary of State met with members of the Alliance. He was supported 
at the meeting by his Private Secretary, both of his SpAds, Mr Zeff, Daniel Beard of counsel, 
an  in-house  lawyer  and  a  member  of  the  DCMS  Media  Team.  Ofcom  and  the  OFT  were 
represented, at the suggestion of the Alliance. For the Alliance there were representatives 
from Trinity Mirror, Guardian Media Group, Telegraph Media Group, Associated News and 
Media, and Slaughter and May. The Alliance explained the basis of its opposition to the UIL 
and support for a referral to the Competition Commission which the Secretary of State then 
discussed with them.280

5.44  DCMS  had  asked  the  Alliance’s  public  affairs  advisers,  Weber  Shandwick,  not  to  attend. 
Internal  DCMS  emails  evidencing  the  debate  which  led  to  this  decision  reveal  that  there 
were differences of opinion. It is striking that amongst those arguing against their attendance 
was Adam Smith who wrote: “No public affairs advisors from News Corp were in any of our 
meetings with them. It was News employees plus lawyers wasn’t it? So I still feel they shouldn’t 
be there”.281 This view overlooked the fact that News Corp was relying upon its own in house 
public affairs team, of which Mr Michel was a part, and that Mr Michel had attended both 
meetings with the Secretary of State about the bid earlier that year.282

5.45  There  followed  a  period  during  which  three  Labour  politicians,  Ivan  Lewis  MP  (Shadow 
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport), Lord Prescott and Mr Watson all pursued 
correspondence with Mr Hunt about the bid. Mr Lewis wrote on 30 March 2011 raising a 
number of questions about the bid and asking whether the Government would, in the light 
of the experience, remove politicians from such decisions in the future: “In light of the very 
real issues of impartiality that have arisen in relation to this case will you consider including 
provisions in the Bill which would remove politicians from having any quasi-judicial role in 
relation to specific plurality and cross media ownership decisions?”.283 The Secretary of State 
replied on 19 April 2011 but, on the last point, he did so in non-committal terms.284 The future 
role of politicians in media plurality and cross media ownership decisions is an important 
issue and is discussed further later in this Chapter.285

1363

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I5.46  On 11 April 2011, Lord Prescott followed up the letter which he had written on 15 March 
2011 during the consultation period with a second letter.286 He developed and updated the 
point which he had made earlier about the unfolding story of phone hacking at the News of 
the World. During the intervening period, on 8 April 2011, News International had admitted 
that its previous investigations had not been thorough enough and indicated that it would 
be settling some civil cases. In particular, Lord Prescott asked the Secretary of State to delay 
his decision whilst the Metropolitan Police investigated and warned against approving the 
bid. Mr Hunt replied the next day. His stance, at that stage, on phone hacking was that: “The 
phone-hacking allegations are of course very serious, but they are matters for the criminal 
courts.  They  have  no  bearing  on  the  separate  matter  of  media  plurality,  and  my  decision 
on the merger could be challenged if I allowed these allegations to colour my view.”287 He 
also referred to s67(5) of the Enterprise Act 2002 which he considered prevented him from 
widening the scope of the intervention.

5.47  Both of the points which Mr Hunt raised in response to Lord Prescott were the subject of 
further thinking and advice at DCMS. So far as the phone hacking allegations were concerned, 
on 18 April 2011, an official advised Mr Hunt that they might have some relevance to the 
decision on UIL, if the wrongdoing was known about and endorsed or ordered at a senior 
level within News Corp. The advice was put in these terms:288

“The phone-hacking issues as currently admitted by News Corp cannot properly be 
considered by you when making your decision on the matters of plurality which were 
the subject of the public interest intervention. However, it is the nature of undertakings 
that  they  depend  to  a  certain  extent  on  trust.  Our  advice  is  therefore  that  those 
activities may be relevant to your decision, but only to the extent that they suggested 
that you could not reasonably expect News Corp to abide by their undertakings, for 
example if the wrong-doing was known-of and endorsed or ordered at a senior level 
within News Corp. This might also be relevant to the level of risk you want to assume 
in relation to the operational agreements (see above).” (emphasis added)

5.48  At  that  stage,  Mr  Hunt  did  not  believe  that  the  evidence  went  so  far  as  to  give  rise  to  a 

question of trust within News Corp, as opposed to NI:289

“But  the  advice  we  got  on  18  April  did  say  that  the  one  way  that  phone  hacking 
could  impinge  was  if  they  thought  there  was  an  issue  of  trust,  so  that  accepting 
undertakings basically meant that you had to be confident that you could trust the 
people that you were doing a deal with over those undertakings.
So at that stage it was a matter about News International. It wasn’t a matter that 
there was any evidence at all that it affected News Corporation executives that we 
were dealing with. We thought they had a problem with a company that was part of 
News Corporation group, but there was no evidence, and we didn’t think we’d have 
any legally robust basis to suggest at that stage there was an issue of trust.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.49  On or about 18 April 2011, the scope of the intervention was raised by the Secretary of State 
within his Department. Insofar as is material, an email of that date from Paul Oldfield, the 
Secretary of State’s Principal Private Secretary, read:290

“Actions for our Comms meeting this morning
...
SoS  asked  whether  we  could/should  look  to  invoke  the  PI  test  re  “fit  and  proper 
person” re Newscorp / Sky merger...”

A related email between Jon Zeff and Rita Patel, referring to that quoted above, put it this 
way:291

“See below, SoS raised two points
...
B)  wants to make sure we’ve thoroughly kicked the tires on scope for invoking the 
standards limb of the pi test.
Someone  has  suggested  to  him  that  we  could  instigate  a  new  reference  because 
information has come to light (on phone hacking) which wasn’t available to vince c 
when he took the original decision. I was doubtful but agreed to check.”

5.50 

In the result Mr Hunt did not seek to widen the scope of the intervention. Whether he had 
the power to do so would have been an interesting legal question.292 He stuck to the line 
which he had adopted in correspondence, namely that s67(5) prevented him from doing so. 
Of course, whether or not he had the power to amend or replace the original EIN, Ofcom 
at all times had the power to remove BSkyB’s broadcasting licence if it believed that that 
company was not a fit and proper person to hold it. In September 2012, that was a question 
which Ofcom did ultimately address concluding, after James Murdoch had stepped down as 
Chairman, that it was a fit and proper person. Of significance to the Inquiry’s consideration of 
the bid is the fact that, by asking the questions and raising the issues recorded in the internal 
emails quoted above, Mr Hunt demonstrates an open mind and a desire to act properly.

5.51  There was a further exchange of letters when, on 24 May 2011, Lord Prescott copied an article 
from the Guardian reporting criticism of News Corp by former US Vice President Al Gore.293 
Mr Hunt replied on 27 June 2011 pointing out the limited remit of his decision, and assuring 
Lord Prescott that he would only accept UIL which were legally robust and enforceable and 
which addressed the media plurality concerns.294

5.52  Meanwhile, on 19 April 2011, Mr Watson also wrote to Mr Hunt, following up a letter which 
he had sent on 24 January 2011, before the consultation. His first letter had raised phone 
hacking at the NoTW (to the extent then known) and urged Mr Hunt to widen the scope 
of his intervention to include News Corp’s commitment to broadcasting standards. He had 
concluded:295

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“So  egregious  are  these  breaches  that  I  am  surprised  that  you  have  not  already 
commissioned Ofcom to test News Corp’s commitments to broadcasting standards. I 
request that you do so now as a matter of urgency.”

5.53  Mr Hunt had replied to the earlier letter on 8 February 2011 pointing out (as he later did to 
Lord Prescott) that s67(5) of the Enterprise Act 2002 prevented him from making a further 
intervention in the case.296 Mr Watson’s second letter updated his first because News Group 
News Ltd had, in the meantime, admitted liability in some of the civil claims arising from 
voicemail  hacking.  He  repeated  his  call  for  a  widening  of  the  scope  of  the  intervention, 
suggesting an amendment to the original EIN and argued that any UIL given by News Corp 
would be unreliable:297

“Clearly News’s [sic] illegal activities render them unsuitable to own Sky and I believe 
you ought to specify this as a public interest consideration. If it is the position under 
the enterprise Act that there may be only one intervention notice given to the OFT 
then the notice should be amended to add reference to the broadcasting standards 
commitments mentioned above particularly in the context of News’s [sic] admission 
of guilt; and the matter should be referred once more to Ofcom to carry out further 
investigations  in  this  regard.  You  should  dismiss  the  UIL  being  offered  by  News 
since they patently cannot be relied upon and the matter should be referred to the 
Competition Commission for a detailed investigation.”

5.54  Mr Watson wrote again on 10 May 2011 to communicate the fact that “other criminal trials 
have been launched that strengthen my original concerns” and to chase for a response.298 
Mr  Hunt  responded  on  17  May  2011  explaining  that  an  EIN,  once  issued  could  not  be 
amended, but that Ofcom has the power at any time to remove a broadcasting licence from 
a broadcaster it does not believe to be a fit and proper person. He only had power to refer 
the case to the Competition Commission on plurality grounds but assured Mr Watson that 
he would only accept UIL if they were legally robust and enforceable.299 The internal emails 
referred to above corroborate that this was indeed Mr Hunt’s intention.

5.55  Mr Watson sought to continue the correspondence with a further letter on 21 June 2011 

seeking a full list of News Corp shareholders but events soon overtook this request.300

5.56  The fact that the regulators were making “good progress” in their dealings with News Corp, 
which had “now responded positively to virtually all the key issues and (eventually) provided 
all the documentation requested” was reported to the Secretary of State on 13 May 2011.301 
Ofcom and the OFT had been joined in their scrutiny of the commercial agreements which 
would give effect to the proposed UIL by solicitors Pinsent Masons, instructed by the Secretary 
of State to scrutinise them from the commercial perspective of Newco. Their work added an 
additional dimension to the checking process.302

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.57 

It took until 22 June 2011 for the OFT and Ofcom to complete and deliver their advice. The 
OFT  had  not  been  moved  fundamentally  by  the  responses  to  the  consultation  but  it  had 
acted on a number of suggestions  for the improvement to the UIL which  News Corp had 
eventually adopted. The OFT put it this way:303

“The Reviewed Responses do not, individually to collectively, provide reasons for the 
OFT to change the fundamental tenor of its March Advice.
However,  the  Reviewed  Responses  do  provide  suggestions  as  to  how  the  1  March 
UIL could be improved so as to improve the practical and financial viability of the 
proposed UIL. The OFT has discussed these improvements with News, and News has 
been willing – ultimately – to accept all of the amendments which the OFT regards as 
material and desirable...”

5.58  The  resulting  amendments  to  the  UIL  were  listed  in  an  Annex  to  the  advice.304  Where 
suggestions or comments had not been taken forward, the OFT explained why. The advice 
made clear that none of the amendments could address the essential structural limitation 
identified in its December 2010 report which meant that, in its opinion, the UIL were unlikely 
to be practically and financially viable over the long term.305 As for the carriage and brand 
licensing agreements, they had been discussed and amended in places with the result that 
the OFT was satisfied, stating that:306

“In light of the changes made, the OFT advises that the Revised Carriage Agreement 
and Revised Brand Licensing Agreement are consistent with the Revised UIL and the 
OFT’s previous advice with regard to their practical and financial viability”.

5.59  Ofcom similarly reported the strengthening of the UIL in response to issues identified in the 
responses to the consultation exercise. As to the long term viability of the UIL, it stood by its 
previous position that ten years in the media industry was long term. It pointed out that if 
News Corp sought to reacquire Sky News at the end of the period then the public interest test 
under the Enterprise Act 2002 might be triggered if the threshold criteria were met. Ofcom 
put it thus:307

“As we have previously advised, we agree that the proposed UIL are not a permanent 
solution and that their effectiveness may start to diminish in the run up to the end of 
the 10 year period. We consider that a carriage agreement of a 10-year term in the 
context of industry dynamics in this sector is long term. This is because we consider 
there is likely to be significant evolution of the market and consumers’ use of news 
and current affairs over the next decade. As a result, the situation with regard to 
plurality may be significantly different in 10 years time.
As set out above, at the end of the 10 year period, the prohibition on acquisition and 
the carriage agreement come to an end. If News Corporation wished to acquire the 
remainder of the shares in Newco after the end of the 10 year period, a media public 
interest test may be triggered if the threshold criteria in the Enterprise Act 2002 are 
met.

304 pp153-157, ibid
305 p150, ibid
306 p151, ibid
307 p168, ibid; Ofcom also repeated its call for a review of the statutory framework to ensure plurality in the public 
interest in the longer term

1367

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid IIn order for the Secretary of State to have sufficient flexibility for dealing with plurality 
issues we would, however, refer to our previous advice that the Government should 
consider undertaking a wider review of the statutory framework to ensure plurality in 
the public interest in the longer term. We believe that the current system is deficient 
in failing to provide for intervention to be considered where plurality concerns arise 
in the absence of a relevant corporate transaction involving media enterprises, for 
example as a result of organic growth.”

5.60  As had the OFT, Ofcom raised those responses to the consultation which it had not acted upon 
and explained why it had not done so. On the question of the carriage and brand licensing 
agreements, Ofcom was satisfied with revised versions of the agreements dated 15 and 16 
June 2011 respectively. Overall, Ofcom was satisfied, concluding that:308

“For all the reasons set out above and in our previous letters of advice, we consider 
that the revised proposed undertakings offered by News Corporation would address 
the plurality concerns identified in our report of 31 December 2010.”

5.61  The Secretary of State accepted the advice of the regulators and prepared to make a further 
written ministerial statement. Before doing so he took advice from his officials on what could 
and could not be published. It is clear from internal DCMS emails that Mr Hunt wanted to 
publish  as  much  as  he  could,  although  in  the  result  it  was  not  practicable  to  publish  the 
carriage  and  brand  licence  agreements  for  reasons  of  commercial  confidence.  Mr  Hunt’s 
Principal Private Secretary recorded in an email dated 27 June 2011 that:309

“SoS said he would like to press ahead with statement on BskyB on Thursday. SoS said 
he would like to publish all docs (inc brand licensing and carriage agreements – even 
if redacted) and would like to press News Corp for those docs this week. We discussed 
having a quick handling meeting this afternoon to discuss draft statement etc...”

Provisional acceptance of the amended draft UIL and further 
consultation

5.62  The Written Ministerial Statement was made on 30 June 2011. It communicated Mr Hunt’s 
decision which was that he was minded to accept the revised UIL, and he was satisfied with 
the carriage and brand licensing agreements as amended. He announced a further and rapid 
consultation, allowing seven days for further views on the revised UIL.310 The statement was 
very carefully crafted to emphasise not only that he had engaged both Ofcom and the OFT to 
a greater extent than he was obliged to, but also to make clear that he could have accepted 
the original UIL and was exercising his discretion to require more of News Corp. It began:311

“I am today publishing the results of the consultation on the undertakings in lieu I 
launched on 3 March alongside the subsequent advice I have received from Ofcom 
and  the  OFT.  The  consultation  did  not  produce  any  information  which  has  caused 
Ofcom  and  the  OFT  to  change  their  earlier  advice  to  me.  I  could  have  decided  to 
accept the original undertakings. However a number of constructive changes have 
been suggested, and as a result, I am today publishing a revised, more robust set of 
undertakings and will be consulting on them until midday Friday 8 July.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIAs previously, I was not required to involve independent regulators in assessing the 
revised undertakings. However I have again done so, and sought their independent 
advice.  I  am  today  also  publishing  that  advice,  which  after  careful  consideration  I 
have decided to accept.”

5.63 

In  addition  to  the  advice,  Mr  Hunt  published  the  proposed  Articles  of  Association  for 
“Newco”,  the  revised  UIL  and  a  summary  of  the  responses  to  the  consultation.312  The 
Ministerial Statement explained the process and the developments which had taken place 
in  consequence  of  the  consultation  responses,  including  all  of  the  changes  which  he  was 
now minded to accept. It then went on to deal with a number of issues which had often 
been raised in the responses to the first consultation including the emerging phone hacking 
allegations  against  the  News  of  the  World.  At  this  stage,  Mr  Hunt  unequivocally  adopted 
the  stance  that  the  allegations  were  immaterial.  There  was  no  mention  of  their  potential 
relevance to the reliability of the undertakings. The material part of the statement explained 
why Mr Hunt was then of the view that the allegations should not influence his decision:313

“Some respondents also argued that News Corp could not be relied upon to abide 
by  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  undertakings,  citing  previous  guarantees  and 
assurances given by News in the past, and the current hacking allegations against 
the News of the World.
I have taken the view that News have offered serious undertakings  and discussed 
them  in  good  faith.  In  all  the  circumstances  and  given  that  the  implementation 
of  those  undertakings  will  be  overseen  by  the  Monitoring  Trustee  and  thereafter 
monitored and if necessary enforced by the OFT, I believe that there are sufficient 
safeguards  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  undertakings.  Furthermore,  the  various 
agreements  entered  into  pursuant  to  the  undertakings  will  each  be  enforceable 
contracts. Therefore whilst the phone hacking allegations are very serious they were 
not material to my consideration.”

5.64  Mr  Hunt  regarded  the  substantive  protections  afforded  by  the  revised  UIL  to  be  very 

considerable, describing them in these terms:314

“So it was a further strengthening of these UILs in a way that made Sky News massively 
more independent of James Murdoch than it was then or indeed is now.”

5.65  The  statement  concluded,  as  it  had  started,  in  terms  designed  to  engender  trust  and 

confidence in the process:315

“I  am  committed  to  maintaining  the  free  and  independent  press  for  which  this 
country is famous. I have sought and published independent advice throughout this 
process. I have listened carefully to points made in the consultation and amended the 
undertakings where appropriate. I have also gone for maximum transparency whilst 
taking reasonable account of commercial confidentiality considerations. I continue

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ito believe that, if I allow this deal to proceed, Sky News will be able to continue its 
high-quality output and in fact will have greater protections for its operational and 
editorial independence than those that exist today.”

The phone hacking scandal and the withdrawal of the bid

5.66  By this stage, it looked as if the deal was close to being approved. That state of affairs was to 
change very rapidly. The consultation, which lasted until midday on Friday 8 July 2011, took 
place during a tumultuous week for News International. The phone hacking scandal came to 
a head and, on Thursday 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced that the NoTW was to close. 
There was, once more, an enormous response to the consultation, as Mr Hunt confirmed in 
his evidence:316

“Q.  And you received in that short period of time 156,000 responses. Virtually all 
were, again, anti, weren’t they?
A.  Yes.”

5.67  On the day that the consultation closed, a post on the DCMS website made clear that the 
Secretary of State would now also be considering the impact of the closure of the NoTW on 
media plurality. On this point it read:317

“The Secretary of State will consider carefully all the responses submitted and take 
advice from Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading before reaching his decision. Given 
the volume of responses, we anticipate that this will take some time. He will consider 
all relevant factors including whether the announcement regarding the News of the 
World’s closure has any impact on the question of media plurality.” (emphasis added)

5.68  On the following Monday, Mr Hunt sought the advice of both Ofcom and the OFT on the 
developments. He asked the OFT whether any of the past week’s revelations caused it to 
reconsider any of its previous advice:318

“However, given the well-publicised matters involving the News of the World in the 
past week, and which have led to the closure of the paper, I should be grateful if 
you could let me know whether you consider those revelations and allegations cause 
you  to  reconsider  any  part  of  your  previous  advice  to  me,  or  otherwise  gives  rise 
to concerns, on the credibility, sustainability and practicalities of the undertakings 
offered by News Corporation.”

5.69 

In particular, Ofcom was asked whether the events that followed its letter of 22 June 2011 
changed in any way the advice it had offered as regards three areas:319

“The closure of the News of the World in the last week is a significant change to the 
media landscape. I would be grateful if you could indicate whether this development 
(and/or the events surrounding it) gives you any additional concerns in respect of 
plurality  over  and  above  those  raised  in  your  initial  report  to  me  on  this  matter 
received on 31 December 2010.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansII am aware of your letter on Friday to John Whittingdale MP in relation to any proposed 
fit and proper persons test and would be grateful if you could keep me informed of 
progress. In particular I would be grateful if you could clarify whether in your view, 
your current consideration or any potential future decision in relation to the fit and 
proper persons test might have an impact on the merger and my decision on media 
plurality or on the proposed undertakings in lieu.
Given the well-publicised matters involving the News of the World in the past week 
that  led  to  its  closure,  I  would  be  grateful  if  you  could  let  me  know  whether  you 
consider that any new information that has come to light causes you to reconsider 
any part of your previous advice to me including your confidence in the credibility, 
sustainability or practicalities of the undertakings offered by News Corporation.”

5.70  Mr Hunt impressed upon the Inquiry the gravity of the watershed moment which had led him 

to write to Ofcom and OFT, describing it in these terms:320

“Then we had the horrific Milly Dowler revelations on 4 July, which I don’t think anyone 
could not have been touched by, and then a couple of days later News Corporation 
announced that they were closing the News of the World.
That, for me, was a very, very significant moment because then I began to wonder 
whether there could be a management issue that spread beyond News International 
to News Corp, and even if it wasn’t an issue of trust, even if I accepted that the people 
that we were negotiating the UILs with, … were doing so in good faith, I asked myself, 
if they found it necessary to close down a whole newspaper – this is a big, big deal for 
a company like News Corporation – is there a corporate governance issue here? Is this 
a company that actually doesn’t have control of what’s going on in its own company, 
even if the management don’t know about what’s happening?
So it was really that and, of course, the fact that there was a plurality issue with a big 
newspaper being closed down and the fact that Ofcom had been asked to investigate 
whether BSkyB was a fit and proper licence holder for a broadcasting licence, those 
came together. So a week after the Milly Dowler revelations I wrote to both Ofcom 
and the OFT to ask them whether they still stood by the advice they’d given me at the 
end of June that plurality considerations had been addressed by the UILs as they did 
then.”

5.71  Faced with a crisis, James Murdoch decided to withdraw the UIL with the inevitable result 
that Mr Hunt decided to refer the proposed transaction to the Competition Commission. Mr 
Murdoch explained his decision in a letter to Mr Hunt later on 11 July 2011:321

“...we  have  listened  and  considered  public  sensitivity,  political  concern  and  the 
requests for an independent Competition Commission review. In these circumstances 
I have taken a decision to withdraw the undertakings. This will allow the matter to be 
considered by the Competition Commission on an objective and fair basis taking into 
account factors and evidence which are relevant to the only applicable legal test of 
sufficiency of media plurality.

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid INews  Corporation  continues  to  believe  that  properly  taking  into  account  those 
factors its proposed acquisition will not lead to there being insufficient plurality in 
news provision in the UK.”

5.72  Mr  Hunt  announced  his  decision  to  refer  the  proposed  merger  to  the  Competition 
Commission in Parliament on the afternoon of 11 July 2011. The terms in which he expressed 
himself reflected the dramatic change in atmosphere which the previous week’s events had 
wrought:322

“...As a result of News Corporation’s announcement this afternoon I am going to refer 
this to the Competition Commission with immediate effect and will be writing to them 
this afternoon.
Today’s  announcement  will  be  an  outcome  that  I  am  sure  the  whole  house  will 
welcome.
It will mean that the Competition Commission will be able to give further full and 
exhaustive  consideration  of  this  merger  taking  into  account  all  relevant  recent 
developments.
Mr Speaker, protecting our tradition of a strong, free and independent media is the 
most sacred responsibility I have as Culture Secretary. Irresponsible, illegal and callous 
behaviour damages that freedom by weakening public support for the self-regulation 
upon which it has thrived. By dealing decisively with the abuses of power we have 
seen, hopefully on a cross-party basis, this government intends to strengthen and not 
diminish press freedom, making this country once again proud and not ashamed of 
the journalism that so shapes our democracy.”

5.73  Avaaz  sought  to  seize the  moment  to  press  the  case  for  the  Secretary of  State to  issue  a 
new EIN widened in scope to include not only plurality but also commitment to broadcasting 
standards. The group did so on 12 July 2011 by sending DCMS a Note, produced by counsel 
expert in merger and competition law, which challenged the view that s67(5) of the Enterprise 
Act  2002  prevented  the  Secretary  of  State  from  widening  the  scope  of  the  intervention. 
Counsel concluded:323

“Although I cannot claim that the position is certain, I can say that in my view, given 
the factual context set out above, any attempt by News Corporation to challenge a 
decision by the Secretary of State to issue a further Notice allowing him and the CC to 
consider fitness would be more likely than not to fail, notwithstanding section 67(5) 
of the EA02.
...
I should make it clear that I am not saying that the Secretary of State is bound now 
to issue a replacement Notice allowing fitness to be examined as a public interest 
consideration. His discretion is a wide one. However, in the present circumstances, 
the view that he definitely cannot lawfully do so seems to me to be far too cautious.”

5.74 

In the result, that legal argument did not need to be resolved because although the transaction 
was formally referred to the Competition Commission on 13 July, News Corp subsequently 
withdrew  its  bid  and,  on  25  July  2011,  the  reference  was  cancelled  by  the  Competition 
Commission.324

322 p282, ibid
323 pp292-298, ibid
324 pp304-311, ibid. The reference was cancelled in accordance with the provisions of article 7(1) of the 2003 Order

1372

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.75  The speed at which a proposed transaction such as News Corp’s bid for BSkyB is considered 
may itself be commercially sensitive (in this case there can be no doubt that, for News Corp, 
it was the sooner the better). From the point of view of the public interest there will also 
generally be a need to deal with this sort of decision promptly because it would not be in the 
public interest for regulatory delay to thwart a deal deserving of approval. However, that need 
for promptness in the public interest will always be qualified by the public interest in ensuring 
that the proposed transaction is considered sufficiently to ensure that the right decision is 
made. In this case the speed at which the bid was actually considered was consistent with the 
public interest. Mr Hunt described himself as wanting to do things “briskly but properly”.325 
He certainly sought to avoid unnecessary delay but when time was needed fully to consider, 
take advice about, and to consult upon the UIL, it was afforded.

5.76 

Lobbying behind the scenes
In  addition  to  the  considerable  volume  of  responses  which  were  the  product  of  the 
Secretary of State’s specific invitations to interested parties to make submissions, there was 
a  remarkable  amount  of  additional  unsolicited  communication.  Some  of  this  came  from 
the Alliance, whose solicitors and public relations advisers actively sought to influence the 
Secretary of State through correspondence. These contacts though paled in comparison to 
the  voluminous  behind  the  scenes  contact  between  Mr  Michel  and  people  at  the  DCMS. 
In particular, Mr Michel had a great deal of email, text and telephone contact with Adam 
Smith. It is now well known that the publication of Rupert Murdoch’s exhibit KRM18, which 
evidenced some of this contact, led very quickly to Mr Smith’s resignation. It is therefore now 
necessary to consider the nature and extent of unsolicited and behind the scenes lobbying 
whilst the bid was Mr Hunt’s responsibility.

The Alliance

5.77  Like News Corp, the Alliance had begun to lobby DCMS before the transfer of the bid. Emails 
in the period 8 to 10 December 2010 show that there was a meal attended by representatives 
of DCMS and Weber Shandwick, after which the latter offered and the former accepted a 
briefing  on  “the  plurality  issue”.326  The  DCMS  official  made  clear  (as  was  the  case  at  that 
stage) that DCMS had no formal role but Weber Shandwick was still keen to get its client’s 
message across: “...I know you have no formal role but good for you to hear our case and why 
we think there is a change”.327

5.78  On 26 December 2010, the bid then having been transferred to Mr Hunt, Weber Shandwick 
copied Slaughter and May’s submission to Ofcom to DCMS.328 The next day the firm sent the 
results of a poll conducted by the Alliance to a DCMS official.329 DCMS wisely cancelled the 
planned  briefing  but  Weber  Shandwick  thereafter  remained  in  email  contact  with  DCMS. 
Of the briefing an in-house legal adviser wrote: “...I don’t think the presentation was, in any

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ievent, to Jeremy, but given recent events, I think that we ought to distance from any remote 
suggestion of influence by any interested party”.330

5.79  When reports emerged that News Corp was discussing remedies with the Secretary of State, 
Weber Shandwick was quick to ask for a meeting which was declined.331 The firm also sought 
early sight of Ofcom’s report which it was not granted on the ground that the Secretary of 
State would publish the report, in redacted form, in due course.332 Weber Shandwick later 
forwarded copies of letters from Slaughter and May dated 12 and 20 January 2011 (discussed 
further below) but did not add substantively to them.333

5.80  Slaughter and May also wrote directly to the Secretary of State on a number of occasions, 
typically following reports in the media about the progress of the bid. On 12 January 2011, 
the firm wrote after reports in the (FT) that discussions about UIL had commenced. UIL had 
in  fact  only  been  mentioned  at  the  meeting  between  Mr  Hunt  and  James  Murdoch  on  6 
January 2011 as something which News Corp wanted to discuss if their primary submission 
that Mr Hunt should not refer the bid failed. The first draft UIL had not yet been submitted to 
the Secretary of State. Slaughter and May pointed to the low threshold for a reference to the 
Competition Commission, arguing that remedies should not be considered before a referral, 
and seeking further information. TSol replied on behalf of the Secretary of State with a letter 
which,  amongst  other  things,  gently  made  clear  that,  if  and  when  the  time  came  for  the 
Alliance to make submissions, then they would be sought.334

5.81  At that stage, Mr Hunt was, in any event, minded to refer the bid and had not yet formed 
even a provisional view about the UIL. He was not then obliged to hear submissions from 
the Alliance. Indeed, on the question of referral they would have been otiose and on UIL 
premature. When later, after taking advice from Ofcom and the OFT, the Secretary of State 
became minded instead to accept the UIL, he launched a consultation (to which the Alliance 
was able to and did respond).

5.82  Slaughter  and  May  was  not  content  to  wait.  On  20  January  2011  the  firm  made  further 
unsolicited submissions, this time following publication by the (FT) of news that News Corp 
had offered to divest Sky News. It argued that it would be difficult to achieve an effective 
remedy  without  wholesale  divestment  of  BSkyB  and  pressed  again  for  a  reference  to  the 
Competition Commission.335

5.83  When the Secretary of State announced that he was asking the OFT and Ofcom to advise 
him on News Corp’s proposed UIL, and would go out to public consultation if he provisionally 
decided to accept the same, Slaughter and May wrote to him seeking to be involved at an 
earlier stage. On 27 January 2011 they wrote, inter alia:336

“You only propose to go out to public consultation however, after you have provisionally 
decided (in the light of the advice from OFT and Ofcom) to accept such undertakings.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIIn order to ensure that the overall process is both fair and thorough, it will therefore 
be critical for Ofcom / OFT and the Secretary of State to consult with key industry 
players (including the Concerned Parties) ahead of the provisional decision.”

5.84  The Alliance did not get the early involvement that it was seeking and so Slaughter and May 
wrote again, on 9 February 2011, making a veiled threat to judicially review the Secretary of 
State. It persisted with the argument for early involvement:337

“We understand that the process you envisage would require Ofcom (working with 
OFT)  to  assess  undertakings  in  lieu  of  reference  to  the  Competition  Commission 
(“the CC”) without the involvement of interested third parties. Third parties would 
instead only be consulted after Ofcom / OFT have reported to you and after you have 
concluded that you are minded to accept such undertakings.
It is our view that this process would be unfair and would fail to meet the normal 
procedural standards of merger control and public law more generally.
...
If  your  decision  is  to  meet  public  law  requirements  of  fairness,  it  is  essential  that 
interested third parties are properly consulted before Ofcom / OFT report to you and 
before you propose to accept undertakings.
...
In the absence of the above safeguards, the review will be procedurally unsound.”

5.85  TSol replied on behalf of the Secretary of State on 11 February 2011 refuting the allegations 
of unfairness and repeating the point, more bluntly this time, that the Alliance would have 
an  opportunity  to  make  submissions  at  an  appropriate  time  if  the  need  arose.  The  letter 
concluded:338

“Proper  and,  as  you  put  it,  meaningful  consultation  does  not  require  multiple 
iterations of comment throughout a decision making process such as this one. The 
important  point  is  that  you  and  your  clients  are  given  an  opportunity  properly  to 
comment on any proposal to accept undertakings in lieu of a reference. You will have 
that opportunity.
Finally, I cannot but emphasise that if, and I stress if, the Secretary of State does reach 
a view that he proposes to accept undertakings in lieu of a reference, he will carefully 
consider  any  observations  you  and  your  clients  may  have  about  those  proposed 
undertakings.”

5.86  Slaughter and May nevertheless continued with its effort to get the Alliance more deeply 
involved at an earlier stage, writing again on 1 March 2011, this time following another article 
in the (FT) which had been published on 24 February 2011 on the subject of the proposed 
UIL. It sought an outline of the key features of any remedy proposals made by News Corp; 
the opportunity for the Alliance to discuss the proposals with OFT and Ofcom prior to them 
advising the Secretary of State; and the opportunity to discuss the remedy proposals with 
the Secretary of State prior to any provisional decision or substantive announcement which 
he may make on the issue.339 The firm’s repeated representations about process were then 
overtaken by events when the Secretary of State reached the provisional view that he was

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iminded to accept UIL from News Corp and consequently initiated a statutory consultation. 
As  has  already  been  recited  above,  Slaughter  and  May  submitted  lengthy  and  detailed 
submissions  as  part  of  that  process  and  subsequently  attended  the  Secretary  of  State’s 
meeting with Alliance members on 24 March 2011.

5.87 

In March 2011 Weber Shandwick was involved in arrangements for the Secretary of State’s 
meeting with the Alliance.340 The firm itself was at the last minute asked not to attend that 
meeting with the result that News Corp had an internal public affairs officer in attendance 
when James Murdoch met the Secretary of State, but the Alliance was prevented from having 
an equivalent, albeit external, adviser present.

5.88  Finally,  there  was  a  brief  email  exchange  between  Weber  Shandwick  and  DCMS  in  which 
the former sought information and asked whether their further input was needed. The firm 
received a brief and entirely proper response.341

5.89  A  number  of  observations  flow  from  a  consideration  of  the  Alliance’s  unsolicited 
communications. First, there was a qualitative difference between its lobbying efforts and 
those  of  News  Corp  in  that  it  was,  essentially,  conducted  through  emails  to  officials  and 
formal correspondence. The approach to lobbying by News Corp extended well beyond that 
and, at least in part, took the form of Mr Michel’s indefatigable use of text messaging, email 
and the telephone.

5.90  Second, the financial stakes associated with the proposed transaction, and the passions which 
it aroused, caused the Alliance, through its solicitors, to push as hard as it could to be heard 
throughout the process. It is almost inevitable that exactly the same will happen when the 
next major qualifying media transaction falls to be considered under the Enterprise Act 2002.

5.91  Third, the veiled threat of judicial review from the Alliance, when combined with the equally 
threatening correspondence from News Corp’s lawyers, amply demonstrates the need for a 
process which is both robustly and manifestly fair to all parties if it is neither to be impugned 
in court nor impossibly slow.

5.92  These three observations all point to the desirability of detailed procedural guidance being 
available for a Secretary of State responsible for administering quasi-judicial decisions under 
the Enterprise Act 2002 and for a fair yet workable procedure to be established and followed 
throughout.  That  need  is  made  all  the  more  clear  after  a  consideration  of  the  lobbying 
undertaken by Mr Michel.

Frédéric Michel’s contact with Jeremy Hunt

5.93  On Christmas Eve, some three days after responsibility for the bid had been transferred to 
Mr Hunt, Mr Michel sought to lay the ground to make use of the channel of communication 
which  he  had  previously  established  with  the  Secretary  of  State.  With  characteristically

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.94  Mr Hunt immediately appreciated that, as the decision maker, he was now in a very different 
position and properly informed Mr Michel that all contact from then onwards needed to be 
through official channels until the decision had been made:343

“Thanks Fred. All contact with me now needs to be through official channels until 
decision made. Hope Daddy has a lovely Xmas. Jeremy”

5.95  Mr Michel held back, but only for a short while. He cautiously resumed communication by 
text  on  20  January  2011  following  the  second  of  the  two  formal  meetings  about  the  bid 
to which he had accompanied James Murdoch. He was careful not to mention the bid, but 
sent:344

“Great to see you today. We should get [names redacted] together in the future to 
socialise! Nearly born the same place! Warm regards. Fred”

5.96  Mr Hunt’s brief reply implicitly made clear that any socialising with Mr Michel would have to 

await resolution of the bid but in terms which made slight reference to the bid:345

“Good to see u too. Hope u understand why we have to have the long process. Let’s 
meet up when things are resolved J”

5.97  Mr Michel picked up on that slight reference in a response which he augmented with flattery:346

“We do and will do out very best to be constructive and helpful throughout. You were 
very impressive yesterday. And yes let’s meet up when it’s all done. Warmest regards 
fred”

5.98  Mr  Michel  did  not  text  Mr  Hunt  again  until  3  March  2011,  the  day  on  which  Mr  Hunt 
announced  to  Parliament  that  he  was  minded  to  accept  News  Corp’s  UIL,  when  he  again 
resorted to flattery:347

“You were great at the Commons today. Hope all well. Warm regards, Fred”

5.99  That text led to two more within a few minutes of the first. Mr Hunt replied briefly: “Merci 
large drink tonight!” Mr Michel concluded the exchange on a similarly friendly note: “Me too! 
Taking wife out for dinner!”348

5.100  There were two more exchanges during the currency of the bid. First, on 13 March 2011, Mr 
Michel praised Mr Hunt’s performance in an interview: “Very good on Marr. As always! Fred”. 
Mr Hunt’s reply amounted to a polite reminder of the bid and consequent need for some 
distance: “Merci hopefully when consultation over we can have a coffee like the old days!”349

5.101  Second, on 3 July, Mr Michel sent a text to propose a social engagement: “Come on Nadal!! We 
should get together to celebrate the one year baby birthdays! Hope all well. Warm regards, 
Fred”. Mr Hunt replied in friendly terms but once again he put off Mr Michel whilst the bid

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iwas in progress: “Agree he MUST win! Let’s do that when all over”.350 During his oral evidence 
Mr Hunt candidly reflected on Mr Michel’s 3 July 2011 text, stating:351

“I think it’s incredible ingenuity. I mean he was just looking for any opportunity he 
could try and establish contact of some sort or another. You know, it was pushy. You 
know, I responded briefly, courteously, and in a friendly way as well.

What I didn’t deduce from this, and I think you alluded to in earlier comments, was 
the effect of this kind of contact multiplied many, many times over to Adam Smith. 
And that was the crucial thing right at the beginning of the process that we didn’t 
foresee, the fact that there was going to be such a volume of correspondence, ...” 
(emphasis added)

5.102  It is conspicuous that all of the exchanges during this period were initiated by Mr Michel. All 
were brief. The bid was barely touched upon and there was no substantive communication 
either about the substance of the bid or the process. It was all about making the connection 
at the personal level. Mr Hunt was careful to put off any social arrangements until after the 
bid. His responses were consistent with the general approach which he took to those in the 
media industry with whom he came into contact during the bid. In evidence, he explained:352

“...what  I’m  really  saying  in  paragraph  37  is  that  because  of  my  other  duties  as 
Secretary of State, I was going to be bumping into people who had views on the bid.
I think during that period I spoke at the Oxford Media Convention where the whole 
media world would be gathered and I gave a speech and answered questions and 
there would have been coffee afterwards, and so there would have been – but they 
were  brief  interactions,  and  I  interpreted  that  to  mean  there  might  be  a  casual 
comment about the bid, but they weren’t part of my consultation process.”

and later he said:353

“All the interactions which related to the decision that I was going to take would be 
through official channels, but as I explained there, if I bumped into someone in a lift 
or gave a courteous reply to a text message, I didn’t think that was off limits.”

5.103  It would have been prudent for Mr Hunt politely to have insisted that Mr Michel should not 
seek to communicate (whether by text or otherwise) until after the bid had been resolved, 
thus enforcing the wish which he expressed at the outset on 24 December 2010. Doing so 
would  have  prevented  any  suggestion  of  the  appearance  of  bias  arising  from  the  contact 
which in fact occurred. The direct contact between Mr Hunt and Mr Michel which did occur 
was not entirely satisfactory but, having said that, I should make it clear that I do not consider 
that, on its own, it would have been sufficient to impugn the process had it been the subject 
of judicial review.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIJames Murdoch and Jeremy Hunt

5.104  Mr Hunt also exchanged text messages with James Murdoch during the period in which he 
was responsible for the plurality decision. On the evening of 3 March 2011, the day on which 
Mr Hunt announced that he was minded to accept the UIL and launched the first statutory 
consultation about them, James Murdoch sent a text in appreciation: “Big few days. Well 
played. JRM”. Mr Hunt replied: “Thanks think we got right solution!” He followed that the 
next day with a text which had nothing to do with the bid but was connected to the sporting 
element of his portfolio: “Just been with the Team GB cycling team in Manchester who are 
most impressed with the personal interest you show in their performance!”354

5.105  There was then an exchange of messages on 31 March, initiated by Mr Hunt who wished 
to congratulate Mr Murdoch upon his promotion.  The Secretary of State’s message joked 
about  Mr  Murdoch’s  relationship  with  Ofcom:  “Many  congratulations  on  the  promotion 
although I am sure u will really miss Ofcom in NY! Jeremy”. The reply recognised that there 
were constraints on contact whilst the fate of the bid remained unresolved: “Thanks Jeremy 
– sadly I fear they won’t see the back of me that easily! Hopefully we can move our other 
business forward soon so we can catch up properly. Best”.355

5.106  Mr Hunt was clear that his reference to Ofcom was tongue in cheek and that it had no impact 
on the process. However, if faced with the same situation again, he said that he would just 
avoid all text messages:356

“Q.  Were you at all uncomfortable communicating with Mr James Murdoch in this 
way?
A.  Well, I think, you know, as we look at the whole way quasi-judicial processes are 
run and as we look at the lessons that we learned from what happened between 
Adam Smith and Mr Michel, I think there are probably things we would learn, and my 
interpretation of my quasi-judicial role was that a courteous reply to a text message 
was fine. I think probably now I wouldn’t take the same view, and I would just avoid 
all  text  messages,  but  that  was  my  assessment,  that  it  had  absolutely  no  impact 
on the process. It was not material to the decision I took, and it was just me being 
courteous.” (emphasis added)

Jeremy Hunt and Andy Coulson

5.107  On  the  advice  of  Sue  Beeby,  his  SpAd  who  dealt  predominantly  with  media  relations,  Mr 
Hunt drew the line at meeting Andy Coulson whilst a decision about the bid was pending. 
He had been intending to have a drink with Mr Coulson and Ms Beeby advised by email. 
Referring to News Corp, she wrote: “He’s so closely linked to them that if you were seen it 
wouldn’t look great.” Mr Hunt thought that advice was “absolutely right” and that it was 
“wiser to wait”.357 This approach was in keeping with his decisions not to meet Mr Michel or 
Mr Murdoch socially whilst he was responsible for the decision about the bid.

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid IFrédéric Michel and Adam Smith

5.108  In  his  dealings  with  Adam  Smith,  Mr  Michel  found  a  more  communicative  target  for  his 
lobbying  endeavours.  The  type  and  volume  of  their  communications  during  the  currency 
of  the  bid  is,  of  itself,  striking  and  well  illustrates  just  how  deftly  Mr  Michel  managed  to 
inveigle his way to a source so close to the Secretary of State. There were numerous emails, 
many telephone calls and, most of all, a prolific number of text messages. No fewer than 
690 text messages passing between Mr Michel and Mr Smith were found on the image of 
Mr Michel’s iPhone covering the period 27 August 2010 to 11 July 2011, the majority sent by 
Mr Michel.358 All but three of these messages post dated the transfer of the bid to Mr Hunt, 
the manifestation of a step change in the attention which Mr Michel paid to Mr Smith once 
regulation of the bid rested in Mr Hunt’s hands.359 The evidence from Mr Michel’s iPhone was 
but one piece in the jigsaw of evidence which, when put together and analysed led to the 
following overall statistics being put to Mr Michel in evidence and with which he did not take 
issue:360

“Can I move on now to your communications with Mr Adam Smith. Would you agree 
that there was a pattern of very frequent text messages, telephone calls and emails 
with Mr Smith, which certainly increased from December 2010?
A.  Yes.
Q.  Overall, over the period June 2010 to July 2011, we have counted the following: 
191 telephone calls, 158 emails, 799 texts, of which over 90 per cent were exchanged 
with Mr Smith. Does that feel about right?
A.  I didn’t know the quantum, but I trust your counting.
Q.  Over the period 28 November 2010 to 11 July 2011, we have counted 257 text 
messages sent by Mr Smith to you, and given that you were more prolific in your texts 
to him than he was to you, there would be more than that which you sent. Would you 
agree?
A.  I would.”

5.109  The  content  of  these  communications  was  further  evidenced  by  Mr  Michel’s  numerous 
emails to his colleagues within News Corp, often including James Murdoch, reporting on his 
activities and exhibited by Rupert Murdoch as KRM18. Publication by the Inquiry of KRM18 
began to bring the full extent of the contact between Mr Michel and Mr Smith into the public 
domain. On the basis of that evidence, Mr Hunt’s Permanent Secretary, Jonathan Stephens, 
described how he quickly assessed the communications to have been unacceptable:361

“...The first suggestion that the contacts went beyond what was proper was 24th April 
2012 with the release of emails from Frederic Michel (and this was the first occasion I 
recall mention of Michel by name). The following morning I told the Secretary of State 

358 pp4-690, Frederic Michel, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Exhibit-FM91.pdf 
359 Mr Smith’s records (from his telephone bill http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AS4.
pdf) showed 19 messages to Mr Michel in the period 28 November 2010 – 27 December 2010 which are not found on 
the image of Mr Michel’s iPhone indicating that some messages might have been deleted from that phone. Too much 
weight should not therefore be attached to the precise statistic but the overall pattern evident in the records does 
show a step change in contact after 21 December 2010

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansII thought the number, extent, depth and tone of contacts suggested by those e-mails 
went beyond what was acceptable”.

5.110  After time for reflection and after both Mr Michel and Mr Smith had given their oral evidence 

to the Inquiry, Mr Stephens remained of the same view, saying:362

“The first thing I thing I would say is that I have to be clear that I think, as I’ve said, 
the extent, the number, the nature of these contacts was, in my judgment, clearly 
inappropriate and not just in one or two disputed cases. I think that’s a judgment I 
just have to place on record.”

5.111  I agree with that assessment. In doing so I have taken into account that there was a often a 
degree of hyperbole and inaccuracy in Mr Michel’s email reports of his exchanges with Mr 
Smith with which Mr Smith rightly and unsurprisingly took issue. I recognise that the majority 
of the contact was initiated by Mr Michel, not Mr Smith, and that some of the individual 
communications  were  innocuous,  concerning  either  anodyne  matters  of  process  or  being 
mere  repetition  of  what  News  Corp  had  already  been  told  formally.  I  also  recognise  that 
Mr Smith had held himself out as being a point of contact for News Corp. But none of that 
escapes the fact that Mr Michel and Mr Smith  engaged in a very considerable volume of 
private communication about the bid, much of which was clearly inappropriate for reasons 
which are examined further below.

5.112  Before turning to the detail of the exchanges in the period after the bid was transferred to 
Mr  Hunt,  it  is  instructive  first  to  examine  the  status  of  SpAds,  the  rules  which  applied  to 
Mr  Smith,  his  working  relationship  with  Mr  Hunt,  and  how  he  was  managed,  supervised, 
instructed and guided.

5.113  SpAds are temporary civil servants appointed under Article 3 of the Civil Service Order in 
Council  1995.  They  are  unique  amongst  civil  servants  because  they  are  exempt  from  the 
general  requirement  that  civil  servants  should  be  appointed  on  merit  and  behave  with 
impartiality and objectivity so that may retain the confidence of future Governments of a 
different political complexion. Indeed, they are political appointees, appointed by Ministers 
with  the  approval  of  the  Prime  Minister.  The  amalgamation  of  civil  servant  and  political 
partisan into the same post makes for a hybrid position.363 A SpAd’s appointment ends at 
the end of the administration which appointed him (or her) or when the appointing Minister 
leaves the Government or moves to another appointment.364 The Code of Conduct for Special 
Advisers (“the Code”) explains the nature of the role of a Special Adviser, in the following 
terms:365

“Special  advisers  are  employed  to  help  Ministers  on  matters  where  the  work  of 
Government  and  the  work  of  the  Government  Party  overlap  and  where  it  would 
be inappropriate for the permanent civil servants to become involved. They are an 
additional resource for the Minister providing assistance from a standpoint that is 
more politically committed and politically aware than would be available to a Minister 
from the permanent Civil Service.”

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I5.114  Paragraph 3 of the Code lists and describes types of work which a Special Adviser can be 
expected to undertake. There is no mention of assisting a Minister acting in a quasi judicial 
capacity.366

5.115  The Code makes clear that management and conduct of SpAds, including discipline, rests with 
the appointing Minister, subject to the overriding power of the Prime Minister to terminate 
the employment of a SpAd by withdrawing his consent to their appointment. The material 
part of paragraph 4 of the Code reads:367

“...The responsibility for the management and conduct of special advisers, including 
discipline, rests with the Minister who made the appointment. It is, of course, also 
open to the Prime Minister to terminate employment by withdrawing his consent to 
an individual appointment”.

5.116  The  appointing  Minister’s  responsibility  for  the  management  and  conduct  of  a  SpAd  is 
repeated at paragraph 3.3 of the Ministerial Code which also describes the accountability of 
Ministers for their actions and decisions in respect of their SpAds:368

“The responsibility for the management and conduct of special advisers, including 
discipline, rests with the Minister who made the appointment. Individual Ministers 
will be accountable to the Prime Minister, Parliament and the public for their actions 
and decisions in respect of their special advisers”.

5.117  The Code imposes a duty of confidence upon SpAds in these terms:369

“...Special advisers should not, without authority, disclose official information which 
has been communicated in confidence in Government or received in confidence from 
others...”

5.118  Mr Stephens had, amongst his many duties, an advisory role as: “...the principal adviser to 
the Secretary of State across the range of his functions, including on all decisions, matters of 
policy or questions of conduct.”370 He was accountable to the Secretary of State: “...for the 
effective discharge by the Department of all its functions in support of the Government and 
its objectives.”371 As he put himself put it: “I am accountable for all the advice and ultimately 
what goes on within the department, as I set out in my statement”.372 He thus had, in that 
respect, overall responsibility for the handling of the bid and he oversaw the process. His 
advisory role to his Minister in relation to all decisions and questions of conduct was wide 
enough in principle to encompass advice to Mr Hunt as to the use to which Mr Smith was 
put in relation to the bid and how he discharged that role. It was advisory only, of course; the 
decisions about the deployment and management of the SpAd were for Mr Hunt.

5.119  Pursuant to his advisory role, it had been Mr Stephens who drew to the attention of Mr Hunt 
and Mr Smith not only the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers but also the Ministerial Code

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIand the Civil Service Code when Mr Hunt took office and Mr Smith was appointed. Mr Stephens 
saw it as his role to provide advice in relation to these codes in case of uncertainty, stating:373

“These Codes are drawn to the attention of Ministers on appointment by the Cabinet 
Secretary. I write to Special Advisers on their appointment to draw their attention to 
the Code of Conduct of Special Advisers – I wrote to Adam Smith on 14 May 2010 (this 
letter is attached). I also brief both Ministers and Special Advisers on the importance 
of abiding by these Codes and my availability to provide advice in any uncertainty. It 
is also my practice to explain to Special Advisers that, in all external dealings, they will 
be seen as representing their Department and Minister.”

5.120  Mr  Smith  was  one  of  two  SpAds  who  worked  for  Mr  Hunt.  He  concentrated  on  policy 
development  whilst  the  other  SpAd,  Sue  Beeby  (after  October  2011,  Lisa  Hunter)  dealt 
primarily with media relations.374 Mr Smith knew Mr Hunt very well and vice versa. He had 
worked for him since 2006 as his Parliamentary Researcher and then Chief of Staff, before 
becoming a SpAd when Mr Hunt was appointed as Secretary of State after the May 2010 
General Election. In Mr Smith’s words:375

“...we developed a very close working relationship. He came to know my approach 
to  matters  and  my  style,  which  is  generally  relaxed,  courteous  and  seemingly 
accommodating”.

5.121  Mr Hunt’s evidence was unequivocally to the same effect. He was sure that Mr Smith would 

have known what he thought on different issues:376

“...I doubt there’s a minister who worked more closely with a special adviser than I 
worked with Adam Smith, I really did work very closely with him for best part of six 
years, I think it was a given that he would know what I thought on different issues. I 
don’t think that’s quite the same as speaking for me, which is a different thing, but I 
think people would have expected him to know my views”.

5.122  Geographically,  at  DCMS,  the  SpAds’  office  was  on  the  same  floor  as  the  Ministers.377  Mr 
Smith  described  a  high  level  of  professional  contact  with  Mr  Hunt  but  a  lesser  degree  of 
contact with him about News Corp’s bid for the remaining shares in BSkyB:378

“Mr Hunt and I saw each other almost every working day and we spoke frequently 
on the telephone. Over the years, I considered that I developed a close professional 
relationship with Mr Hunt. He was familiar with my approach and style. The regular 
meetings, to which I refer above, and our more informal, regular, contact provided 
him with opportunities to obtain updates from me in relation to the projects with 
which he had asked me to become involved and I would provide updates, as I mention 
above, either at our meetings, by telephone or more informally at the office. We did 
not socialise together that often – we only went for drinks on a handful of occasions,

couple of other staff at the time”.

and in relation specifically to the bid:379

“Not  as  frequent  as  it  –  as  you  might  have thought, I  suppose.  I  mean  there was 
[sic] the meetings which I’ve listed there, but I would – I wouldn’t go and speak to 
him about it on anything like a sort of daily basis or even – it would only be if he was 
preparing for a major statement or if there were the odd occasions where an issue 
that I judged to be of significant interest to him, that I would go and speak to him 
about it, but he – the whole point of having the department, the officials and myself, 
I suppose, was so that we could kind of carry on which the work and not need to go 
running to him every day.”

5.123  Mr Smith understood his role in practice to require three things of him: “...to be [Mr Hunt’s] 
“eyes and ears” inside and outside of the Department; to act as an early warning system on 
issues of importance; and to be a “buffer” between him, other Ministers, officials and outside 
organisations so that he could focus on his work”.380 The third of these capacities is important 
in understanding the role which Mr Smith believed himself to be playing in his interactions 
with Mr Michel. In relation to the bid he described his role as: “To be one of the points of 
contact for News Corporation. To act as a buffer and as a channel of communications.”381

5.124  Although undoubtedly answerable to Mr Hunt, Mr Smith did not have a line manager of the 

type in place for ordinary civil servants. He explained:382

“I didn’t really have a line manager, if you like, I reported in to Mr Hunt and would sort 
of meet with and talk with the senior officials, including the Permanent Secretary, but 
there was no sort of manager in that sort of strictest sense of the word, no.”

5.125  Mr Smith’s performance was required to be the subject of formal appraisal on an annual 
basis by a number of individuals, one of whom had to be his Secretary of State, Mr Hunt, and 
another, the Permanent Secretary, Mr Stephens. Both would have required some familiarity 
with Mr Smith’s job description, objectives and day to day performance in order to discharge 
that responsibility.

5.126  Mr Smith’s most recent appraisal, in December 2011, vividly corroborates the very positive 
evidence which both Mr Hunt and Mr Stephens gave orally about his general performance. 
He was extremely highly regarded. Mr Hunt wrote:383

“Adam is an effective operator; bright, articulate, insightful, extremely well briefed 
and an effective communicator. He sees his main task as “getting things done”. To 
date he has been very effective at achieving it.
He is able to me my eyes and ears at meetings I cannot attend and knows exactly what 
I would want to happen. He is brilliant at handling difficult situations in a civilised way 
without compromising on core objectives.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIAn ideal bridge between the department and Ministers, consistently adds value, and 
has been particularly adept at handling issues between Ministers.”

5.127  Although, as the above appraisal makes perfectly clear, Mr Smith was a talented and able 
SpAd,  he  had  had  no  previous  experience  of  quasi-judicial  decision  making  prior  to  his 
involvement  in  the  bid.  Moreover,  he  had  been  a  SpAd  for  only  a  matter  of  months  and 
consequently had limited experience of working in Government as opposed to working in 
politics more generally. In those circumstances, it was particularly important that his role in 
the handling of the bid should be clearly defined and that he had clear, appropriate guidance 
and instruction.

5.128  There was, at that time, no specific written guidance either for SpAds or more generally for 
departments relating specifically to quasi-judicial decisions and none was specifically issued 
in relation to News Corp’s bid to acquire BSkyB. On 25 April 2012, the day after publication 
of KRM18, the Cabinet Office produced and provided to departments new guidance on the 
handling of quasi-judicial process: “Principles governing the handling of quasi-judicial decision 
by Ministers.”384 It is intended to complement the range of good practice guidance already 
available to departments on the Cabinet Office website.385 Specifically in relation to SpAds, 
the new guidance states:386

“Special advisers. Decisions of this sort should not be made by reference to political 
or presentational considerations. This applies regardless of the source of the advice, 
and  that  of  special  advisers  is  treated  in  the  same  way  as  advice  from  an  official 
giving internal advice to Ministers. If a special adviser is approached by an interested 
party, he/she should refer the matter to the appropriate official. A special adviser 
so  approached  must  not  give  the  impression  that  any  particular  advice  will  be 
determinative when decisions are taken.
Departments should bear in mind that details of any potentially relevant contacts 
are liable to be disclosed in the event of a challenge to the decision. All Departments 
should have formal written guidance for those involved in decision-making processes. 
Such guidance may be of general application. But departments should also consider 
issuing  specific  guidance  for  certain 
individual  decisions,  particularly  where 
such  decisions  arise  infrequently,  raise  issues  of  unusual  sensitivity  or  are  of  such 
complexity or novelty that general guidance is likely to be insufficient to assist in the 
proper discharge of the decision-making function in accordance with these general 
principles. All such guidance should be agreed by the relevant Permanent Secretary 
and Legal Adviser.” (emphasis added)

5.129  It is commendable that guidance has now been produced and that it was done so quickly 
after the problems identified by the Inquiry’s examination of the bid exposed a gap in existing 
guidance. However, it is regrettable that no written guidance was available when DCMS had 
to deal with News Corp’s 2010 bid for BSkyB.

5.130  Mr Smith does not appear to have been given any express individual instructions as to how 
he should, or should not, conduct himself with interested parties on matters relating to the 
quasi-judicial decision. On this point, Mr Hunt, who was himself new to quasi-judicial process,

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Isaid that they both relied on meetings with lawyers and officials for an understanding of what 
was required of them and that he did not give Mr Smith any express instructions:387

“Q.  Any communication between Mr Michel and Mr Smith would be no different, 
would it, to communication between Mr Michel and you, because Mr Smith was your 
agent. Do you agree with that?
A.  Not in this process. I think sometimes special advisers have a role which is about 
speaking for their boss, but in this situation Mr Smith’s role was a different one. He 
was  a  point  of  contact  in  a  very  complex  process,  and  there  to  advise  News  Corp 
about the questions they had about the process and I think also to reassure them that 
the process was fair.
Q.  What express instructions, if any, was Mr Smith given as to what his special role 
was?
A.  Well, he was present at all the meetings where we had advice from lawyers and 
officials in the department, so he heard that advice, and it was understood that he 
would be a point of contact for News Corp in the process.
Q.  But what express instructions was he given as to the role he would undertake?
A.  I don’t think he was given any express instructions other than how I’ve described 
it.
Q.  So in terms of the discharge of the function which had been allocated to him, your 
evidence is he would work that out from what he heard at meetings; is that correct?
A.  Yes.
Q.  Did you give him any instructions as to what not to do?
A.  No. As I say, he heard in the way that I heard all the things that we needed to be 
careful about.”

5.131  Mr Stephens (who knew that Mr Smith was in contact with News Corp but did not know of 
the volume or detail of that contact) accepted with the benefit of hindsight that Mr Smith 
should have been warned about the risks arising from dealing with a professional lobbyist:388

“Q.  The third point out of my four: the power of advocacy and sophistication of the 
lobbyist. Although you didn’t know [Frederic Michel] personally, or know his exact 
title, you knew the sort of role he was occupying and that it was his job, really, to 
push as hard as he can to extract as much as he possibly could. Nothing necessarily 
inappropriate  in  that,  but  there  was  a  particular  risk,  therefore,  that  the  special 
adviser needed to be alive to and perhaps warned about. Do you accept that issue?
A.  Certainly with the benefit of hindsight I wish we had warned him, and indeed I 
think one would necessarily want to warn anyone in contact with him.”

5.132  It is certainly unfortunate that neither Mr Stephens nor Mr Hunt specifically addressed with 
Mr Smith the risk that if he was to be a point of contact for News Corp, he could well come 
under pressure (at least similar to that of which Mr Hunt had had some experience) which 
could be difficult to deal with and so required particular attention. Such attention could not

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIonly have covered providing a greater awareness of the consequences of going beyond those 
limits, but also a degree of managerial and pastoral support to ensure that he could deal with 
the issues likely to arise. Both have said, in effect, that they simply trusted him to get on with 
it by himself.

5.133  Both  Mr  Hunt  and  Mr  Smith  did  have  the  benefit  of  the  departmental  advice  given  in 
November 2010 when  Mr Hunt had  been advised  not  to  contact Dr Cable  about  the bid. 
That advice, which contained the specific phrase “quasi-judicial” should have been enough 
to signal that this was not a normal policy or political decision, but it was not detailed advice 
about how the Secretary of State and those acting in his name should conduct themselves 
once responsibility for the bid had transferred to Mr Hunt. The note which both the Secretary 
of State and Mr Smith were sent explained that the decision was quasi-judicial and that such 
decisions  might  be  judicially  reviewed.  In  particular  it  warned:  “...such  decisions  are  case 
specific and must be taken on the individual merits of the case. They are not decisions about 
broader matters of Government policy as might be decided by Cabinet collectively and must 
be taken by the BIS Secretary of State acting alone.”389 The November advice did not address 
the question of either actual or apparent bias.

5.134  Specific  advice  about  the  process  was  given  after  the  transfer.  The  first  such  advice  was 
given at the handover meeting on 22 December 2010 at which both the Secretary of State 
and Mr Smith were present. There is a documentary record of the meeting in the form of 
an  internal  email  but  it  captures  little  about  what  was  said  generally  about  quasi-judicial 
decision making. It records that: “BIS officials outlined the SoS’s role in the process and the 
various legal considerations.”390

5.135  Both men were also present at an internal meeting on 5 January 2011, which was preceded 
by written advice from DCMS officials. The advice is addressed to Mr Hunt but Mr Smith is 
not included in the copy addressees. In any event, it deals with next steps rather than the 
requirements of a fair quasi-judicial procedure more generally.391

5.136  Mr Stephens in his evidence was confident that the requirements of a fair process had been 

clearly communicated. He stated:392

“Taken together, the written advice offered on 12 November and on 4 January 2011, 
and the oral advice offered in the meetings on 22 December and 5 January, including by 
legal advisers, established in my view clear requirements for how the process needed 
to be conducted, namely that this was a quasi-judicial process, in which decisions 
were now for the Secretary of State alone to take, on the basis of objective assessment 
of the evidence available to him, taking account of all the relevant considerations and 
ignoring any which were irrelevant. He needed to take an even-handed approach, 
giving all sides an appropriate opportunity to make representations, ensuring that 
the process was without bias or the appearance of bias.”

5.137  When asked about what had been said at the 22 December 2010 meeting he thought avoiding 

bias and the appearance of bias had been specifically mentioned:393

389 the minute was addressed to the Secretary of State and copied inter alia to SpAds, pp4-5, Jonathan Stephens,

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“Q.  BIS officials outlined the Secretary of State role in the process and the various 
legal considerations. Do you think that the term quasi-judicial was mentioned on that 
occasion, Mr Stephens?
A.  I think it’s very, very likely.
Q.  Was that concept explained?
A.  Yes. As I recall it, in this meeting and the subsequent meeting, officials took the 
Secretary  of  State  and  others  quite  carefully  through  the  statutory  functions,  the 
stage that had been reached, the next steps, and in particular, rehearsed the need to 
approach the decision with an open mind on a basis that took account of the relevant 
considerations, ignored the irrelevant, that it was even-handed and avoided bias or 
the appearance of bias.
Q.  It’s the avoidance of bias or the appearance thereof which you feel was mentioned 
on that occasion, do you?
A.  Yes.”

5.138  In  some  contrast  to  Mr  Stephens’  recollection,  Mr  Smith’s  recollection  of  what  had  been 
covered in  these meetings  was much  less definite and, in  particular, his  understanding  of 
what a quasi-judicial process required of him was conspicuously vague. As to what had been 
said at the meeting on 22 December 2010, Mr Smith stated: “They [that’s the BIS officials] 
may also have mentioned that Mr Hunt was to act in a quasi-judicial capacity.” (emphasis 
added)394 Once he had refreshed his memory from the documents he clarified:395

“I  think  my  paragraph  44,  the  minutes  that  I’ve  seen,  it  says  the  process  and  the 
various legal considerations were discussed. So that sort of jogged my memory to 
suggest that quasi official may well have been discussed. I can’t remember whether 
it definitively was, but we certainly did discuss quasi-judicial on other occasions if not 
that one.”

5.139  Mr  Smith  was  questioned  closely  on  his  understanding  of  quasi-judicial.  The  exchange, 
although lengthy, bears quoting in full because it suggested that Mr Smith did not in fact 
fully  and  truly  understand  the  procedural  requirements  of  a  quasi  judicial  process,  and 
(consistently with Mr Hunt’s evidence) had not received specific instructions as to what he 
could and could not do, not least with reference to avoiding an appearance of bias. He said:396

“A.  My understanding was that it meant that the decision had to be made only after 
considering certain issues, in this case namely media plurality; the sort of wider political 
or other policy issues couldn’t be taken into account. And then sort of uniquely within 
government that this was a personal decision for whoever the Secretary of State was 
rather than a collective government decision. So a normal policy decision, if you like, 
even though it may well have been Mr Hunt making it. Collective government would 
have meant that they were all essentially making that same decision.
Q.  What about any process requirements built into the concept? Were you aware of 
those?
A.  Of the quasi-judicial concepts?
Q.  Yes.

1388

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIA.  Not – well, the process that we were following was in the Enterprise Act, but I 
didn’t necessarily link quasi-judicial to –
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Let’s just think about the word judicial a bit, because there 
are lots of things I don’t know much about but I know a bit about that. I’m sure you 
would agree with me that if a judge is trying a case, then he can’t speak to the parties 
outside the case and go and chat to them in the evening as the case is going on, 
one side as opposed to the other. You don’t have to be a lawyer to appreciate that 
wouldn’t be right. I mean, would you agree with that?
A.  I would. I think in this particular instance the quasi-judicial process and the fact 
that you’re dealing with two interested parties, you obviously do need to discuss lots 
of different things with those interested parties. In fact, you need to, to get certain 
things to happen.
LORD  JUSTICE  LEVESON:  But  in  a  way  that’s  open  and  transparent  to  everybody. 
Don’t you think? Or not?
A.  Um ...
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: It might be that I shouldn’t be questioning you about what 
you  viscerally  understand  about  the  phrase,  but  what  you  were  told  about  the 
phrase. What you were told it meant you could do or what you were told it meant 
you couldn’t do.
A.  I wasn’t told I couldn’t do anything in particular. It was more about – because it 
was Mr Hunt’s decision, the discussion was mainly about what he could or couldn’t 
do. I don’t remember being told about myself.”

5.140  It became clear that Mr Smith had approached the bid procedurally as he would have done a 

decision in any other policy area:397

“Q.  So whatever quasi-judicial might have meant in practice, it didn’t really – maybe 
I’m  putting  it  slightly  too  high,  but  it  didn’t  really  bear  on  what  you  did  or  didn’t 
do  because  you  just  proceeded  as  you  would  ordinarily  have  proceeded  in  any 
straightforward policy area, is that fair?
A.  Yes, because, as I explained, my understanding of quasi-judicial was that Mr Hunt 
had to decide on media plurality issues and that Mr Hunt himself had to decide on 
the bid. Beyond that, there was no difference to the way I approached it.” (emphasis 
added)

5.141  In the absence of specific instructions, he assumed the role of “point of contact”, “buffer” 

and “channel of communications” because he had behaved in a like capacity previously:398

“Well, I had previously carried out that role for other work that the department had 
done and, as we sort of discussed earlier, for Mr Hunt in opposition. It was never, to 
my memory, sort of directly said to me, but it was just sort of inferred by me and I 
think as we go through, we’ll see the department sort of assumed that that would be 
the case. But there was no sort of direct instruction, if you like, no.”

5.142  Mr Hunt agreed that Mr Smith’s role was to be a point of contact. Indeed, in the light of the 
bid’s very unhappy procedural history up to that point he positively wanted Mr Smith to be 

397 pp94-95, lines 16-1, Adam Smith, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-

398 p88, lines 3-10,  ibid 

1389

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ia helpful point of contact for News Corp. But he had not, he said, seen Mr Smith’s role to be 
a channel of communication through which to exchange his thoughts with those of News 
Corp:399

“Well, I think it’s important to be clear about what we mean by “channel”. I didn’t 
see Mr Smith in this process as being someone who would be telling me what News 
Corp thought or telling News Corp what I thought. I saw him as a point of contact, an 
official point contact in the process, so that News Corp had someone that they could 
call if they had concerns about the process, and someone who was there to – you 
know, I mean the situation in which we inherited responsibility for a bid was one in 
which News Corp felt they had not been fairly treated, and so I wanted to make sure 
that there was someone there who could answer questions about how the process 
was going in a helpful way.”(emphasis added)

5.143  Mr Hunt plainly understood that the decision was for him alone and had to be taken on the 
basis only of relevant considerations, excluding the irrelevant. He no doubt also understood 
that he must not act in a biased fashion. But it is not clear that he fully understood just how 
scrupulous he needed to be to avoid the appearance of bias. It was his first quasi-judicial 
decision and he very fairly accepted that he had learned lessons from the experience:400

“No, I think what I interpreted – my interpretation of quasi-judicial, I think, you know, 
obviously  having  completed  this  process,  one  learns  lessons,  and  I’m  not  saying  I 
would necessarily make exactly the same interpretation now, but my interpretation at 
the time was that what was important was that the decision was impartial, unbiased, 
and that I decided it on the basis of the evidence in front of me, and so that was 
where the transparency was important, but if there was something that was, you 
know, a trivial – not trivial, that’s the wrong word, but it wouldn’t necessarily apply 
to every single matter of process.”

5.144  The understanding described above fits with Mr Hunt’s actions. He was at pains to demonstrate 
how he went about making his decision, taking advice at every step and publishing relevant 
material as far as commercial confidences would permit. But when it came to contact with 
Mr Michel, although he was careful, he did not shut it down altogether. He was also content 
for his SpAd to act as a point of contact for one party to the bid, quietly helping it at least as 
far as matters of process were concerned.

5.145  Neither Mr Stephens, nor Mr Hunt, had any reservations at the time about Mr Smith being 
used as a point of contact for News Corp. Mr Stephens accepted that it was not necessary 
to use a SpAd but his view, based on his experience, was that he expected it to be useful:401

“My experience in these roles is that often there is a mix between roles and that it 
can often be sometimes useful for similar messages to be passed on both channels. 
Certainly  in  this  case,  most  of  the  contact  was  through  legal  advisers,  as  I  would 
expect. There were some exchanges with policy officials and I thought there were 
some exchanges of the equivalent nature with Adam Smith.
My experience in a number of government departments is that there is not a rigid 
distinction between special advisers and officials, necessarily.”

1390

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.146  When asked why he had involved a SpAd at all in the quasi-judicial process, Mr Hunt explained 
that he saw a very positive role for Mr Smith in what was an important issue because he was 
so close to him:402

“Well, he was an absolutely key and trusted aide. He is highly intelligent, highly able, 
and I believed that he would have a very positive role to contribute in terms of making 
sure that the process was run robustly and in the right way generally. He’s a very 
talented person and he’s amongst the officials who are closest to me, so it would have 
been quite a natural thing; indeed, I think as Mr Stephens said, entirely proper and 
appropriate for special advisers to be involved in decisions that their ministers – or 
issues that are very important to their ministers.”

5.147  There is nothing inherently wrong or inappropriate in the involvement of a SpAd in a quasi-
judicial  process  and  no  harm  necessarily  results.  It  does,  however,  carry  clear  risks  which 
can be avoided by using officials for this role, especially if they have experience in this type 
of decision making. SpAds usually work in the sphere of the political and the presentational 
both of which must be put aside for the purposes of making a quasi-judicial decision. Without 
specific  instruction  and  adequate  supervision  there  is  a  risk  that  they  will  act  as  they  do, 
entirely legitimately, when dealing with ordinary policy decisions but in a way which is not 
commensurate with fair process or compliant with the requirements of public law. The risk is 
compounded if, as may well be the case, they are working with parties with whom they have 
had contact in contexts not connected with a quasi-judicial decision. For this reason the new 
Cabinet Office guidance to SpAds, discussed above, which advises SpAds to refer approaches 
from interested parties to an appropriate official is helpful and prudent.403

5.148  When Mr Michel sought, after 21 December 2010, to pursue and exploit the previous contact 
and  rapport  which  he  had  had  with  Mr  Smith,  he  was  dealing  with  a  SpAd  who  had  not 
fully  appreciated the sensitivities of such  contact in  a quasi-judicial  context, but  who had 
understood that his principal wanted him to be helpful to a company which had legitimate 
grounds for complaint about the bid’s handling by Dr Cable. This was a dangerous combination.

5.149  For his part, Mr Michel was a professional lobbyist who, whilst charming and experienced, 
said that he himself was unaware of the dangers to the process of the contact which he was 
actively encouraging Mr Smith to engage in. It was the first time that Mr Michel had dealt 
with such a transaction and the concept of a quasi-judicial  decision was not explained to 
him by a lawyer at any stage.404 He understood something of the position of the Secretary of 
State recognising that any direct discussions should be formal and minuted but he did not 
appreciate the need for distance and transparency when dealing with Mr Hunt’s officials and 
SpAds:405

“Yes.  I  think  we  had  discussions  on  the  fact  that  it  was  very  important  that  the 
decision  rested  with  the  Secretary  of  State,  that  it  was  not  appropriate  to  have 
direct discussions with the Secretary of State unless they were formal and minuted, 
but beyond that we were in unchartered territory in terms of – and I’m speaking in

the Secretary of State.”

and:406

“No.  I  was  never  of  the  view  that  it  was  inappropriate  to  at  least  try  to  put  the 
arguments  or  make  representations  to  these  officers  [civil  servants  and  special 
advisers].”

5.150  In the result Mr Michel interacted with Mr Smith without modifying his ordinary approach to 

lobbying so as to reflect the rather special circumstances of this quasi-judicial process.

5.151  James Murdoch did not regard the channel of communication between Mr Michel and Mr 
Smith as a secret means of informal indirect communication with Mr Hunt. He did accept 
the obvious point that the propriety of their communications was dependant upon what the 
contact was about:407

“Q.  Mr Hunt must have taken the view on advice that formal meetings – and we’ve 
seen the minutes of those meetings, 6 January and 20 January 2011 – were okay, 
would  not  impugn  the  fairness  of  the  process,  but  if  there  is  informal  contact  of 
the sort we’re seeing here, that would be inappropriate and the way to avoid the 
appearance of that is let the informal contact take place secretly between Mr Michel 
and the special adviser. Do you see that point?
A.  Mr Jay, respectfully, I disagree with that point. I think he was saying that informal 
contact  between  me  and  Mr  Hunt  or  others  would  raise  eyebrows,  because  they 
would  say,  “What  was  discussed?”,  et  cetera,  but  general  contact  at  the  political 
level, if you will, at the staff level, around process, around document submissions, 
around – just to give colour around these things from us, that that was something 
that was acceptable and that was part of the process he was setting up.
Q.  It may depend on what the contact is about. Would you agree?
A.  I suppose so, and I assume we’re going to keep going through this.”

5.152  It is regrettable that Mr Murdoch, to whom many of Mr Michel’s email reports were addressed, 
did not at any stage call a halt to, limit or in any sense express concern about the risks that 
might be run as a consequence of the nature and extent of the communications between 
Mr Michel and Mr Smith or the fact that they went beyond what was appropriate in a quasi-
judicial environment.408 Mr Murdoch need only have asked himself what the Alliance would 
have made of sight of the texts and emails which were passing.

5.153  Turning now to the actual substance of the contact between Mr Michel and Mr Smith, it not 
necessary to rehearse in full the course of their communications. From a consideration of 
the relevant evidence as a whole one can discern its defining characteristics. It is conducted 
very much on a personal and informal basis. Mr Michel almost invariably adopts a friendly 
approach, preferring a confrontational stance only very rarely and on key issues. He frequently 
flatters both Mr Smith and his principal, Mr Hunt. There is striking use of the language of 
common cause to communicate a sense of shared purpose. Allied to this is a tone which is

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIoccasionally conspiratorial and surreptitious. Mr Michel uses comments unfavourable of the 
Conservatives’  political  opponents  presumably  designed  to  communicate  that  News  Corp 
was politically “on side”. The majority of the communication is initiated by Mr Michel who is 
by far the more pro-active party. The volume of his contact is high, amounting to a ‘barrage’ at 
times, as Mr Smith rightly described it.409 There was pressure and encouragement to change 
the course of the process as Mr Michel advocated the steps which would have favoured News 
Corp’s interests.

5.154  For his part, Mr Smith was usually brief in his replies, invariably courteous, and generally 
friendly.  He  was  very  often  communicating  mundane  information  about  the  process  or 
repeating  matters  which  Mr  Hunt  or  DCMS  officials  had  already  stated  in  more  formal 
circumstances. He stood his ground when pushed in a direction other than that which Mr 
Hunt intended to take. He very often did not pass on the fact, still less the content, of his 
communications with Mr Michel, thereby fulfilling the role of buffer. On occasions, where 
he judged it necessary, he did pass on information to Mr Hunt, acting as a conduit.410 He was 
aware at the time that Mr Michel was trying to extract information from him: “I’m sure that’s 
what he was trying to do, yes”.411

5.155  But  there  were  times  when  Mr  Smith  succumbed  to  Mr  Michel’s  tactics  and  appeared 
momentarily  at  least  to  have  been  drawn  in  by  the  narrative  of  common  cause.  On  one 
occasion he found himself joking with Mr Michel about an opponent of the bid. On another, 
he  joined  in  criticism  of  Ofcom.  He  passed  on  information  about  the  progress  of  the  bid 
that would have been more properly communicated in a much more formal manner. He did 
not make formal notes of the communications. There is an issue (analysed below) about Mr 
Michel’s source of confidential information about the Government’s thinking as to the form 
which inquiries arising out of the phone hacking scandal would take: whatever the truth of 
the matter, Mr Smith should never have been running any risk of being the source of any but 
the most inconsequential information.

5.156  The  above  impressions  can  be  illustrated  by  reference  to  a  few  salient  examples.  On  10 
January 2011, the telephone records showed three calls between Mr Michel and Mr Smith 
totalling 27 minutes, 55 seconds.412 There is also an email from Mr Michel to James Murdoch 
and others. It is clear from the email that Mr Smith had told Mr Michel about the reaction of 
Ed Richards (of Ofcom) to the points on which Mr Hunt had sought clarification from him.413 
Ultimately, Mr Smith did not dispute that he had done so and correctly pointed out that it had 
always been Mr Hunt’s intention that News Corp should be informed of the clarifications that 
Mr Richards had provided. This is, however, an example of substantive information about 
the bid being communicated by Mr Smith in a very informal manner and without keeping a 
formal record. The e mail recorded in material part that:414

“[Jeremy Hunt/Adam Smith] saw Ed Richards today:

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ihe challenged Ed on the “may be” rationale. Ed was adamant that the threshold was 
very low and referral was the only option
-he also challenged him on “sufficiency of plurality
-ed repeated the same concerns which are in the report
-he didn’t raise remedies with Ed.”

and Mr Smith’s evidence about this was:415

“Q.  That may be right, but at least you’re providing confirmation of what Mr Hunt 
told Mr Richards, and you’re also providing fresh information as to what Mr Richards’ 
position was because you see the sentence:
Ed was adamant that the threshold was very low ...
That, in fact, is correct, as a matter of law.
... and referral was the only option.
That would be a matter of opinion. But unless you told Mr Michel that, he wouldn’t 
know that, would he?
A.  Well, I would have been confirming what Mr Hunt had said, but in the meeting 
that Mr Hunt had with Ofcom, the minutes of that meeting show that he wanted to 
share Mr Richards’ answers to those questions with News Corporation.
Q.  Mm.
A.  So, in this sense, that’s what I was doing.”

5.157  The same email contains a typical example of the sort of report which Mr Smith frequently 
disputed. Mr Michel had gone on to write “He made again a plea to try to find as many legal 
errors as we can in the Ofcom report and propose some strong and “impactful” remedies.” It 
is not necessary to resolve these disputes on a case by case basis, although I am satisfied that 
Mr Michel did on many occasions use hyperbole when reporting his conversations with Mr 
Smith and was prone, on occasion to inaccuracy.

5.158  Mr Michel’s email report of a telephone conversation with Mr Smith on 23 January 2011 
contains  numerous  examples  of  Mr  Michel’s  use  of  the  language  of  common  cause  and 
conspiracy, albeit in this case Mr Smith did not believe that he said what Mr Michel attributes 
to him. Whatever Mr Smith actually said, the terms in which it was reported demonstrate Mr 
Michel’s propensity to record matters in these terms. The report concerned the UIL and News 
Corp’s concerns about publication of Ofcom’s report. It contains the phrases:416

“His view is that once he announces publicly he has a strong UIL, it’s almost game 
over for the opposition.
He understands fully our concerns/fears regarding the publication of the report and 
the consultation of Ofcom in the process; but he wants us to take the heat, with him, 
in the next 2 weeks.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIHe very specifically said that he was keen to get to the same outcome and wanted 
JRM to understand he needs to build some political cover on the process.” (emphasis 
added)

5.159  The startling opening to Mr Michel’s email report of a conversation with Mr Smith to James 
Murdoch dated 24 January 2011 and timed at 15:21hrs reads: “Managed to get some infos 
on the plans for tomorrow [although absolutely illegal..>!]“417 The substance of the report 
concerned an early indication in outline of what was to happen the following day when Mr 
Hunt announced that he was minded to refer the bid but was going to take advice on News 
Corp’s UIL. In fact communicating this information was not, in itself, illegal but the report 
does, put at its lowest, convey a sense that information was surreptitiously being provided.

5.160  The  next  morning  saw  a  text  message  from  Mr  Smith  which,  on  any  interpretation,  was 
unsatisfactory.  Mr  Michel  had  started  the  day’s  exchange  of  text  messages  at  07:56hrs, 
shortly after Mr Hunt’s press statement about the bid had been released. He complained, 
albeit in friendly terms, that Mr Hunt had not said much about the strength (as News Corp 
saw it) of the proposed remedy (the UIL): “Good statement. not much on strength of remedy 
though:) Any news on meeting slots? Tomorrow 10.30 or Thursday afternoon?”418 Mr Smith 
replied at 08:03hrs: “There’s plenty – potential to mitigate problems! We can’t say they are 
too brilliant otherwise people will call for them to be published. Will check on meetings.”419 On 
its face it is conspiratorial and appears to betray Mr Hunt’s thinking as being that the UIL were 
very strong but he did not want to be seen to be saying as much. That is an interpretation 
which would be consistent with the terms of Mr Michel’s email of 23 January 2011, discussed 
above. Mr Smith gave a different explanation for his use of this language, claiming that he 
was being disingenuous to mollify Mr Michel:420

“I think by this stage, Mr Michel had got quite cross that Mr Hunt’s statement didn’t, 
as he had been asking for and pushing for previously – you will call the UILs strong 
or brilliant or, you know, some sort of description like that, and the first part of my 
text was a bit of a – the potential to mitigate problems bit was paraphrasing what 
Mr Hunt’s statement had said that had gone out slightly earlier that morning, was an 
attempt by me to say there is support for the UIL. I mean, if you read what Mr Hunt 
said, I mean it didn’t support the UIL, so my attempt there was quite sort of shaky 
ground, if you like.
Then, the other part was too flippant and jokey, I admit that.
Q.  The position is that Ofcom was recommending a referral to the CC. The UILs had 
been  published  or  –  at  least  published  internally  on  20  January  and  this  was  the 
remedy which would prevent the referral to the CC if they were strong enough, but 
the departmental view, apparently, was that the UILs were solid, were good – indeed 
it was your term, “brilliant”, but you couldn’t say they were brilliant, otherwise that 
would undermine the process and, what’s more, as you rightly pointed out, people 
would ask for them to be published. Don’t you accept that that’s the only reasonable 
interpretation?
A.  That was an attempt by me to pacify and mollify by being slightly disingenuous. If 
you read what Mr Hunt had said, he didn’t say they were brilliant.”

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I5.161  Mr Smith’s explanation shows some vulnerability to Mr Michel’s modus operandi, preferring 
to  enter  into  the  conspiratorial  dialogue  rather  than  provide  an  alternative  and  more 
appropriate  reply.  Mr  Michel’s  response  was  to  keep  pushing.  After  the  Parliamentary 
statement at 09:30hrs that morning he texted: “Still. All the language is statutory. I understand 
the  constraints  but  there  is  nothing  in  the  statement  which  gives  us  comfort  or  send  [sic] 
signals that remedy is strong one.”421 Mr Smith replied: “Other than what Jeremy and I have 
told you! We have no legal wriggle room in a statement to parliament.”422 That reply prompts 
the question: what had the Secretary of State and Mr Smith told Mr Michel? Mr Smith said 
that he was referring only to what Mr Hunt had told them on 20 January and what he had 
reiterated of that.423 He described his text as another example of him trying to get Mr Michel 
off his back.

5.162  By this stage Mr Smith was already far too close to Mr Michel and their communications 
were unacceptable in the context of his principal making a quasi-judicial decision. Despite his 
evident discomfort, Mr Smith explained why he did not call a halt to the exchanges. He felt 
that it was his job to remain as the point of contact:424

“Q.  One strategy you might have used by this point is simply to turn off your mobile 
phone, frankly. Weren’t you reaching the point that this was getting much too close 
now, to this man?
A.  I don’t think that I would have been doing the job that I had assumed in terms 
of being a point of contact with News Corporation if I’d stopped being the point of 
contact with them. I mean, in hindsight I would have maybe liked to have at some 
stages to have had a break from it, yes.”

5.163  It is regrettable that Mr Smith did not take what should have appeared as an obvious step, 
namely to seek the advice of the Permanent Secretary or Mr Hunt either at this stage or, 
indeed, at any stage of the process about Mr Michel’s communications and how he should 
deal with them. In not doing so, he made an error of judgment. Even allowing for his lack of 
experience, the lack of specific instruction, and the perceived need to provide procedural 
reassurance to News Corp, he ought still to have realised that the volume, tone and content 
of Mr Michel’s emails was an issue to be raised with others. Continuing the dialogue and 
seeking to appease Mr Michel was a mistake.

5.164  There were further text exchanges on 25 January 2011 culminating, at 22:26hrs in an example 
of Mr Michel’s use of the language of common cause: “I think we re [sic] in a good place 
tonight no?”425 To which Mr Smith replied: “I agree. Coverage looks ok. Let’s look again in the 
morning though!”426

5.165  On 4 February 2011, Mr Smith sent a text message which he admitted looked surreptitious. 
Mr Michel had asked for sight of the documents submitted by Enders and by Slaughter & 
May. Mr Smith replied: “I haven’t actually got them at the moment. Officials just told me 
about them. Don’t mention them to anyone like oft etc. If we need them I’ll show you.” When

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIquestioned about his choice of words, he accepted that it looked surreptitious, whilst denying 
that anything surreptitious actually happened:427

“Q.  One  possible  inference  is  that  you  were  going  to  do  something  a  little  bit 
surreptitious. Would you accept that?
A.  I do accept that it looks like that way, yes, but I don’t believe anything like that 
happened.”(emphasis added)

5.166  Five days later, on 9 February 2011, Mr Smith joked with Mr Michel in partisan terms. Mr 
Michel informed Mr Smith that he was to see Lord Black, an opponent of the bid: “Am seeing 
Guy Black Monday evening. Interesting. James in London until Friday if needed. He is then off 
to New York next week. Fred.”428 Mr Smith replied: “Take your stab proof vest with you! Am 
hoping for an update later on process so will let you know if anything new” (emphasis added)429 
Mr Smith did not seek to defend the comment: “...I wouldn’t have used that language again, 
if I had the opportunity”.430 Not only does this joke contribute to an appearance of bias given 
by  the  course  of  communications  as  a  whole,  it  also  exemplifies  the  inherent  dangers  of 
using a medium of communication as informal as text messaging in the course of the formal 
process of which, although not the decision maker, he was a part.

5.167  Relevant to the question of the appearance of bias, Mr Smith accepted that the accumulation 
of text messages gave rise at least to the perception that he was on side with Mr Michel. It 
was put this way:431

“Q.  It’s  just  the  accumulation  of  text  messages,  which  arguably  give  rise  to  am 
impression. One can’t identify one particular message and say, “Aha, this means X 
rather than Y”, it’s just the series of them. Do you accept that they are giving rise at 
least to the perception that you were on side with Mr Michel?
A.  I can see how that perception would be created, yes”.

5.168  Despite  the  cumulative  effect  of  very  many  emails  which  prompted  Mr  Smith’s  realistic 
admission, the course of the dialogue was by no means one way. In particular, there are a 
number of issues on which Mr Michel pushed really quite hard for an outcome which he did 
not get. For example, these included efforts to persuade Mr Smith to persuade Mr Hunt to 
dismiss Ofcom’s views. On 9 February 2011, Mr Michel related a conversation with Mr Smith 
in these terms:432

“I told him he had to stand for something ultimately and this was his chance to dismiss 
Ofcom’s views and show he had some backbone, he said he couldn’t ignore Ofcom, 
he had brought them into this OFT process to get some cover and in public debate, he 
would get absolutely killed if he did such a thing.”

5.169  Mr Smith said of this:433

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“Well, I don’t actually remember him saying those sorts of specific words, but I do 
know  that  they  were  constantly  pushing  for  the  Department  to  essentially  ignore 
Ofcom.”

5.170  News Corp’s constant pushing, through Mr Michel and through more formal channels, got it 
nowhere. Mr Hunt resolutely maintained his reliance upon the regulator’s advice. Similarly, 
when  News  Corp  described  Ofcom’s  advice  that  the  hived  off  Sky  News  should  have  an 
independent chairman, Mr Michel told Mr Smith that it was a “deal stopper”.434 That act of 
brinksmanship did not prevent Mr Hunt from writing to News Corp on 15 February 2011 and 
giving the company just 24 hours to agree in principle to that and other recommendations 
that had been made by Ofcom.435

5.171  It is worthy of mention that Mr Michel’s exchanges with Mr Smith about Ofcom’s advice at 
this stage of the process involved premature disclosure by Mr Michel to Mr Smith of a letter 
written by Ofcom to News Corp, a fact that was reflected in typically conspiratorial terms by 
Mr Michel to James Murdoch:436

“–he can’t instruct his officials to get back to Ofcom as he is not supposed to be aware 
that we have received the letter and its content ...so we have to be very careful on 
this.”

5.172  On 11 February 2011, Mr Michel, who was waiting for Ofcom’s report, sent a text to Mr Smith 
at 21:26hrs. It was one of a number that day. He wrote: “Thanks Adam. Hope you get home 
soon.  It  might  arrive  very  late  tonight.  Last  time  Ofcom  sent  it  at  23h!”  Mr  Smith  replied 
sarcastically, in terms which would have struck a chord with News Corp’s jaded view of the 
regulator: “Helpful! Just one of their many strengths”.

5.173  On 17 February 2010, only two days after Mr Hunt’s firm letter to News Corp, Mr Smith found 
himself lapsing into the language of common cause so frequently used by Mr Michel. The 
latter emailed a summary of the previous day’s Media Show broadcast by BBC Radio 4. Mr 
Smith emailed a reply which read: “Interesting. More evidence that we need to be strong and 
confident when we go to public consultation” (emphasis added).437 Mr Smith’s explanation to 
Counsel to the Inquiry that by “we” he meant the DCMS did not escape the fact that this was 
language that might equally have come from News Corp. The exchange went as follows:438

“A.  The point of the email  below is  that there were – I think it was on the radio, 
wasn’t it? Yes. An individual from Enders’ analysis had been saying that there were 
possible remedies that could deal with the Ofcom concerns and, of course, by this 
point News Corporation had written to Mr Hunt to concede on the points that Ofcom 
and the OFT had asked to be in the UILs, so the point there was that, if people that had 
previously been opposed to the undertakings in lieu were now saying that there may 
be undertakings in lieu, that could work and that News Corporation had conceded on 
the issues that Ofcom and the OFT had wanted in there, then there was every reason 
for the department and Mr Hunt to be confident about those undertakings in lieu.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIQ.  You’re almost communicating there a public relations message, and coming close 
to putting yourself in the same boat as News Corp by using the pronoun “we”. Do you 
accept that?
A.  “We” would have been “we” the collective department I wouldn’t have put “I” 
because I obviously wouldn’t have been saying anything publicly.”

5.174  Comparison of Mr Smith’s text messages to Mr Michel on 24 February 2011 with Mr Michel’s 
internal email reporting back to James Murdoch, contain a clear exaggeration by Mr Michel. 
The communications concerned Ofcom’s then ongoing work considering the proposed UIL.439 
At 08:25hrs Mr Smith texted: “They said this was a promising basis from which to work in 
their advice to JH. Not quite complete acceptance so I guess that’s why they are looking for 
confirmation on some things”.440

5.175  At 10:43hrs he stated: “We can’t interfere with the process really. We can give more time but 

not deal with substance whilst they are working with you.”441

5.176  At  10:50hrs,  Mr  Michel  emailed  James  Murdoch  in  terms  which  communicated  what  Mr 

Smith had texted but then added a further sentence:442

“JH just texted that he can’t interfere with the process but can give us more time to 
sort things out. He can’t engage substance whilst Ofcom is working with us. He can 
only use his officials to put pressure at this stage.” (emphasis added)

5.177  Typical  of  Mr  Michel’s  familiarity  and  use  of  flattery  was  a  text  exchange  on  3  March,  at 
the culmination of an intense period of activity leading up to the Secretary of State’s oral 
statement  to  Parliament  announcing  the  first  public  consultation  about  which  Mr  Michel 
texted: “Jeremy is superb”. Mr Smith replied: “I’m now at the airport so missed it but glad 
it went well. The late night and early prep was worth it!” Mr Michel followed up, adding a 
comment with a political dimension: “Seriously. Really good defence and slapped Ivan Lewis 
who was humiliated. Enjoy Italy”.443

5.178  The flattery was later augmented by an offer to socialise. On 5 April 2011, Mr Michel texted: 
“Would you both like to join me and [my wife] for Take That on 4th July at Wembley? Fred”.444

5.179  The  text  which  Mr  Smith  most  regretted  sending  was  dated  2  June  2011.  On  its  face  it 
appears to show that he and Mr Michel had become so close that they were almost working 
together. Mr Smith said that in fact it was another attempt to mollify Mr Michel and was not 
substantively true. The text read:445

“Over the last few days I have been causing a lot of chaos and moaning from people 
here on your behalf. I should have an update later today”(emphasis added)

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I5.180  Mr Smith’s explanation was in these terms:446

“A.  This is the one that I do regret the most. By this stage I was probably coming 
toward the end of my tether, as it were, and I sent him a text to get him off my back, 
but I certainly don’t think anybody in the department would have said that that’s 
what  I’d  been  doing,  and  I  certainly  wasn’t  doing  anything  on  their  behalf,  but  in 
hindsight I shouldn’t have sent it, but it was an attempt to mollify him.
Q.  Either  to  mollify  or  to  indicate  assent  to  the  proposition,  I  suppose,  there’s  a 
degree of collusion here between you, that you’ve become so close that you were 
almost working together. Do you feel that that’s a reasonable inference or not?
A.  I can see how people would think that, but I sent it to mollify him and get him off 
my back, not to do as you’ve just suggested.”

5.181  On 27 June 2011, Mr Michel sent Mrs Brooks an email purporting to communicate Mr Hunt’s 
views about how the Government should respond to the unfolding phone hacking issue. It 
read:447

“Hunt will be making references to phone-hacking in his statement on Rubicon this 
week.
He will be repeating the same narrative as the one he gave in Parliament few weeks 
ago [sic].
This is based on his belief that the police is pursuing things thoroughly and phone-
hacking has nothing to do with the media plurality issue.
[It’s] extremely helpful.
On the issue of the Privacy Committee, he supports a widening of its remit to the 
future of the press and evidence from all newspaper groups on the regulatory regime.
He  wants  to  prevent  a  public  enquiry  [sic].  For  this,  the  Committee  will  need  to 
come up with a strong report in the Autumn and put enough pressure on the PCC to 
strengthen itself and take recommendations forward.
JH is now starting to look into phone-hacking / practices more thoroughly and has 
asked me to advise him privately in the coming weeks and guide his and [No10’s] 
positioning...”

5.182  When asked about this email Mr Smith accepted that he might have asked Mr Michel to be 
kept informed about News Corp’s reaction to the phone hacking scandal but denied that he 
asked to be guided. He said:448

“A.  Yes, certainly. If this was a conversation with me, it’s quite possible that I asked 
him  to  let  me  know  what  steps  News  International  was  taking  in  response  to  the 
phone hacking situation, mainly because the department is obviously responsible for 
the media sector, so that would be interesting, but I would never have asked to be 
guided, and I think this use of the word “privately” again is one that I don’t really sort 
of recognise because if I’d asked him to send me statements they were making about 
phone hacking, then he would have sent them to me. I don’t think that’s privately.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.183  For her part, Mrs Brooks’ reaction was simply to ask for confirmation as to when Mr Hunt 

would be making his statement.449

5.184  On  30  June  2011,  the  day  on  which  Mr  Hunt  announced  that  he  was  minded  to  accept 
the revised UIL, subject to a second short consultation, Mr Michel combined flattery, and 
the  narrative  of  common  cause  in  little  more  than  a  line.  His  text  read:  “Just  showed  to 
Rupert. Great statement by the way. We need to knock Avaaz down. They are all about US 
Democrats”.450

5.185  By 7 July 2011, publicity about the phone hacking scandal was reaching a crescendo. Mr Smith 
called Mr Michel at 17:35hrs and had a conversation lasting 11 minutes and 8 seconds.451 At 
18:01hrs, Mr Michel emailed James Murdoch and others at News Corp with a report relating 
to the bid.452 The subject line read: “JH – CONFIDENTIAL – please read”. The first bullet point 
contains  information  about  the  Government’s  then  current  thinking  about  inquiries  into 
phone hacking. This was material that was not in the public domain. Under the subheading 
“Latest on Rubicon” (News Corp’s code name for the bid) it read:453

“-Was not discussed at the No10 meeting that Hunt had with the PM – was discussing 
the two enquiries [“police” one led by a judge; and “media practices” one not with a 
judge and led by DCMS]”

5.186  Mr Smith accepted that it was possible that he was the source of this information but did not 
accept that it was probable that he did so. The exchange with Counsel to the Inquiry on the 
point was as follows:454

“Q.  There  is  reference  to  two  possible  public  inquiries,  which,  at  that  stage,  we 
believe does represent government thinking on 7 July. The suggestion is that the only 
source for this information could have been you, and it ties in with what we know to 
be a fact, namely the telephone call half an hour earlier. Would you agree that or not?
A.  I’m not sure that I would necessarily be the only source of that information. I can’t 
remember, at that stage, whether I knew that that was the case. I may well have 
done.
Q.  You may well have done?
A.  Yes, I may well have done but I can’t remember whether I did, but I think most of 
the discussions were – most of those conversations were being dealt with by Number 
10 but I don’t know –
Q.  This wasn’t in the public domain as yet, Mr Smith. I think the simple point I’m 
making, and it may be more a matter for inference, if you knew the facts set out in 
the first bullet point, if you accept that there was a conversation within half an hour 
of this email, one possible inference, it may be a reasonable inference, is that you’re 
the source of the information we see in the email. Would you agree with that?
A.  I would agree that that is a possible inference, yes.

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid IQ.  Probable inference?
A.  Possible.
Q.  Unless there was someone else providing this information ahead of the game, 
you’re the only person we can possibly look at for these purposes, I think. Would you 
accept that?
A.  I don’t know who else – I mean lots of other people would presumably have known 
only far more than I would have done by this stage because – but I don’t know who –
Q.  Pretty confidential, I would have thought at this point, what government thinking 
was.  It  would  have  been  known  about,  obviously  within  Number  10,  the  Cabinet 
Office, people high up in DCMS and something that you knew about because Mr Hunt 
might have shared it with you. Is that fair?
A.  I don’t know that I did know about it, but he may well have shared it, yes, but I 
don’t remember at this stage.
Q.  Had  he  shared  this  information  with  you,  do  you  accept  that  it’s  information 
which, I’m not saying that you did impart it to Mr Michel, but you shouldn’t have 
imparted it to Mr Michel?
A.  Yes, I would say so, yes.
Q. Which may explain why you’re hesitant to agree with me that you did impart it to 
Mr Michel –
A.  Well –
Q.  – that would be natural, wouldn’t it?
A.  – I don’t remember imparting it, mainly because I don’t quite know that I knew it, 
which would make it quite strange for me to be able to impart it.”

5.187  The very close temporal link between the telephone conversation and Mr Michel’s email, the 
fact that Mr Michel was obviously reporting in his email about the telephone conversation 
with Mr Smith, the reference to Mr Hunt and the complete absence of evidence that Mr 
Michel was communicating with anyone else about these matters, all lead me to infer that 
it is not merely possible but probable that it was Mr Smith who had provided confidential 
information about Government thinking as to the appropriate form of inquiries arising from 
the phone hacking scandal. The rapid leak of confidential Government thinking to the parent 
company of the entity at the heart of the scandal is undeniably a matter of concern.

5.188  Both  Mr  Hunt  and  Mr  Stephens  knew  that  Mr  Smith  was  in  contact  with  News  Corp.  Mr 
Stephens was aware that Mr Smith was attending formal meetings and “on occasion following 
up points of process and procedure with News Corporation”.455 He did not know Mr Michel’s 
name or job title but he did assume that Mr Smith was in contact with someone with access 
to News Corp’s Chief Executive. He thought that the purpose of Mr Smith’s contact was:456

“To  follow  up  on  matters  of  process  and  procedure,  to  reinforce,  on  occasions, 
messages that the Secretary of State had delivered personally or in correspondence 
to News Corporation.”

456 p30, lines 14-17, Jonathan Stephens, ibid 

1402

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.189  Mr Stephens did not become aware of the full nature or extent of the contact, or, indeed, that 

it had in any way been inappropriate until 24 April 2012.457

5.190  Mr Hunt described Mr Smith’s role as:458

“a point of contact, an official point of contact in the process, so that News Corp has 
someone that they could call if they had concerns about the process, and someone 
who was there to – you know, I mean the situation in which we inherited responsibility 
for a bid was one in which News Corp felt they had not been fairly treated, and so 
I wanted to make sure that there was someone there who could answer questions 
about how the process was going in a helpful way”.

5.191  As well as being aware of Mr Smith’s role, there were occasions during the process on which 
Mr Smith reported back to Mr Hunt about particular aspects of the contact which thought 
were worthy of his attention. When asked whether he had specifically used Mr Michel’s name 
in discussions with Mr Hunt, Mr Smith said:459

“I can’t remember whether I specifically did but I would have thought, on the odd 
occasion that I did mention to Mr Hunt, on one of the issues that I thought was worthy 
of his attention, I would, I think, almost certainly have said, “Fred’s told me X,Y or Z.”

5.192  Nevertheless, Mr Hunt expressed his shock at discovering the true extent of the contact in 

his evidence:460

“Q.  I suppose it might be said that the greater the volume of contact, arguably the 
more extraordinary the contact, the more likely it is that he’d communicated the fact 
that there had been such an amount of contact with you. Are you sure that he didn’t, 
Mr Hunt?
A.  He didn’t, and I was totally shocked when I discovered the level of that contact. I 
think it does explain why sometimes he slipped into inappropriate language.”

5.193  I must admit to finding it surprising that Mr Smith, who had worked for Mr Hunt so closely 
and for so long should have kept him unsighted on the way in which he was performing what 
he saw to be his duty; that, as I understood it, was the role of a SpAd – to be the ‘eyes and 
ears’ of his principal. Both men, however, make it clear that Mr Hunt was unaware of the 
nature, and extent of his contact with Mr Michel. Mr Smith explains the position on the basis 
that his role as a buffer was specifically to protect his principal from the barrage to which he 
had been subjected. In the circumstances, I accept what I have been told.

5.194  There were officials and lawyers within DCMS who knew that Mr Smith was in contact with 
Mr Michel. The evidence about that contact did not suggest that they were aware of the full 
nature and extent of the contact that was actually taking place. However, it did confirm that

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Ino one suggested to Mr Smith that he ought not to be communicating with Mr Michel. Mr 
Smith said:461

“I suppose what I would say is that they generally knew I was in touch. On some 
certain issues they certainly knew, but I don’t think they knew the volume or extent.”

and:462

“...I  think  as  the  process  went  on  with  discussions  I  had  with  members  of  the 
department or emails I sent them, they would have very clearly been aware and knew 
that I was having those discussions with Mr Michel, and nobody ever said, you know, 
where did you hear this or you shouldn’t be doing that or – it was – I assumed that 
was the role I was going to be taking, and then as it developed, I don’t think anybody 
was surprised that that was the role.”

5.195  There were naturally a number of lawyers and officials who were in communication with News 
Corp about the bid. Jon Zeff, who was the lead official for the DCMS on the bid, exchanged text 
messages with Mr Michel. This text contact is deserving of mention because of the contrast 
between it and that which passed between Mr Michel and Mr Smith. There were far fewer in 
number, only 23 in the period 20 January 2011 to 13 July 2011. They are typically very short, 
to the point, and limited to matters concerning the actual execution of the process.463

Conclusions

5.196  In  some  respects,  there  was  much  to  commend  in  Mr  Hunt’s  handling  of  the  bid.  It  is 
undeniable that he had views about News Corp and its place in UK media operations: these 
were views that he was entitled to hold given his portfolio responsibilities. He appreciated, 
however, the need to restore confidence after Dr Cable’s damaging utterances and showed a 
determination to put aside these views and to follow a fair and rigorous procedural route to a 
final decision. At the formal level there was a high level of transparency. Mr Hunt’s extensive 
reliance on external advice, above and beyond the minimum required, was a very wise and 
effective means of helping him to keep to the statutory test and to engender the confidence 
of those opposed to the transaction that an objective decision would be taken. There is a 
danger if the decision maker accepts and follows advice too slavishly. If that is done then 
discretion is fettered. Mr Hunt avoided that risk, as was evidenced by the way in which he 
probed Ofcom’s advice.

5.197  All the effort and good work which was done on the bid was put in jeopardy by a serious 
hidden problem. Had Mr Hunt accepted News Corp’s UIL, and had there been a challenge to 
that decision by way of an application for judicial review, seeking to impugn the procedural 
fairness of the decision (a course which had in fact been the subject of thinly veiled threat 
by Slaughter and May at an early stage) then there would have been an obligation on the 
Secretary  of  State  to  disclose  all  relevant  documents  evidencing  contact  between  News 
Corp  and  him  and  his  officials,  including  that  of  his  SpAds,  relating  to  the  bid.  The  effect 
of  those  documents,  particularly  the  communications  between  Mr  Michel  and  Mr  Smith, 
would undoubtedly have been to give rise to a powerful argument that there was at least

1404

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIthe appearance of bias in the process and therefore the risk of a successful claim for judicial 
review.

5.198  In reaching this view, I should make clear that I am doing so on the merits of the matter. I fully 
recognise that the practical risk of a judicial review in relation to this ‘serious hidden problem’ 
was, almost by definition, low. Those who might have brought such a challenge would have 
been unaware of the basis they had for doing so. Even had the risk eventuated the chance of 
a punctilious search within the Department for all potentially relevant material yielding these 
particular documents were not high either. The majority of the relevant material disclosed to 
the Inquiry was provided from the records of News Corp. But none of this is to the point; the 
substantive legal and ethical issues remain, the hidden problem was there, and it might not 
have remained for ever concealed. The disclosure of these documents as KRM18 during the 
Inquiry process shows that events can take an unpredictable course.

5.199  There is one further observation I make about this. To the extent that the practical risk of 
an  application  for  judicial  review  might  have  been  assessed  as  low  precisely  because  the 
appearance  of  bias  would  not  have  been  apparent  in  departmental  records,  there  are 
additional  reasons  to  express  concern  about  the  hidden  problem  of  voluminous  ‘private’ 
(unrecorded)  communications  by  text  and  email.  In  quasi-judicial  procedures,  there  is  no 
place for any argument that relevant conduct, as all of these communications certainly were, 
is somehow rendered any less relevant because it is informal, unrecorded, and contains some 
mixture of the personal, the political or the presentational.

5.200  I well understand the distinctions that have to be made from the point of view of Government 
accountabilities  between  the  conduct  of  SpAds  (and,  indeed,  Ministers)  on  Government 
business and on party-political or personal business. But these are distinctions which have to 
correspond to the substance of a communication or other course of conduct, not its manner 
and form. Government business does not cease to have that character simply because it is 
transacted out of hours on a personal phone and includes private pleasantries. And where 
quasi-judicial decision making is concerned, all relevant actions and communications by a 
decision maker or those acting with his or her actual or apparent authority are, in reality, 
Government business.

5.201  Among  all  the  excesses  of  Mr  Michel’s  correspondence,  perhaps  the  message  with  some 
of the most concerning wider implications was his advice to his principal not to meet with 
the  decision  maker  on  the  grounds  of  counter-productivity,  but  advising  in  terms  that  he 
“could have a chat with him on his mobile which is completely fine and I will liaise with his 
team privately as well”.464 This example in microcosm of a practice where the informal, ‘off-
record’ and ‘personal’ is seen as an obvious and effective means of conducting lobbying on 
matters of media policy is symptomatic of a problem evidenced more widely to the Inquiry; 
the fact that such practices have a side-effect (I say no more than that) of placing the conduct 
of  public  policy  issues  outside  the  mechanisms  of  transparency,  accountability  and  public 
record cannot but give rise to perceptions and questions which are corrosive to public trust 
and confidence. I underline this point because it is in this respect that I consider the conduct 
of the BSkyB bid to have important characteristics, as part of a much wider issue about the 
relationship between the politicians and the press, which I consider in some detail in the 
conclusions I draw at the end of this Part of the Report.

5.202  It is right to recognise that the bid came to Mr Hunt and DCMS in a crisis not of their making. 
That it did so made Mr Hunt’s task all the more difficult. Even so, examination of the course

1405

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iof the bid shows that the seeds of the problem which was to emerge were sown at an early 
stage. The process that was put into place did not prove to be robust enough. Best practice of 
the kind subsequently encapsulated in the Cabinet Office guidance was not followed. There 
was no written guidance for Mr Smith and others as to the conduct expected of them in a 
quasi-judicial environment. Mr Stephens, no doubt, genuinely believed that the requirements 
and the principle had been made crystal clear in the various meetings that he described, and 
to him as a very experienced and senior civil servant, they may indeed have been.

5.203  Evidently, however, at the level of practical detail, these requirements and the underlying 
reasons for them were not made clear enough for Mr Smith, or even, albeit to a much lesser 
extent, for Mr Hunt. For reasons already discussed above, the use of a SpAd as a point of 
contact for News Corp gave rise to risks which could easily have been avoided by entrusting 
the task to an official: the decision to allocate the role to a SpAd was, in my judgment, unwise. 
That is not because of any question about his integrity or calibre, but because he had a pre-
existing and amicable relationship with Mr Michel, which Mr Michel was able to exploit to 
engineer contact that was inappropriate in volume and in some cases in tone. Mr Michel was 
also able to trade on the fact that Mr Smith would want that relationship to continue after 
the bid was concluded. When faced with the intimacy, charm, volume and persistence of Mr 
Michel’s approaches, Mr Smith was put in an extremely difficult position.

5.204  That was a risk which was, or should have been, obvious from the outset. The consequential 
risks were then compounded by the cumulative effects of the lack of explicit clarity in Mr 
Smith’s role, the lack of sufficient express instruction that it was clear he fully understood, and 
a lack of supervision. They are all matters for which Mr Hunt was responsible, although they 
might have been prevented had Mr Hunt fully appreciated the extent to which meticulous 
attention had to be paid to every aspect of the conduct of quasi-judicial procedure. Given that 
this was the problem that had faced Dr Cable, Mr Hunt was very aware of his own position.

5.205  Irrespective of the extent to which News Corp might have been entitled to feel aggrieved by the 
comments of Dr Cable, the bid was now in different hands and its consideration started afresh. 
Both from the perspectives of Mr Hunt as decision-taker and Mr Stephens’ responsibilities 
for  advising  him  and  for  the  overall  conduct  of  the  bid  process,  it  was  essential  that  the 
precise  limits  of  what  was  acceptable  (and,  just  as  important,  what  was  not  acceptable) 
were fully understood by all who might have contact with News Corp or its executives: that 
most certainly included anyone in the position of Mr Michel. Unfortunately, both Mr Hunt 
and Mr Stephens appear to have overestimated Mr Smith’s detailed comprehension of the 
requirements and limits of his role, and his capacity to put them into practice unsupported; 
their overconfidence in him appears, ironically, to have its roots in the excellence which Mr 
Smith  had  demonstrated  in  his  more  usual  duties.  For  Mr  Hunt,  this  was  an  issue  of  the 
tasking and management of his SpAd; for Mr Stephens, it was an issue that could create risks 
for conduct of the bid.

5.206  There is much to say by way of mitigation for Mr Smith. He was inexperienced, had been 
involved in Government for a matter of months and had never before been involved in (even 
if he had ever heard about) a quasi-judicial process. He did not receive what was to be, for 
him, sufficiently clear or detailed guidance because, although he heard what Mr Hunt and Mr 
Stephens heard and, I have no doubt, wanted to further the proper discharge of his principal’s 
duties, he did not appreciate the limitations; neither was he appropriately supervised. On the 
one hand, he behaved as if his role was to act as ‘eyes and ears’ which meant keeping Mr 
Hunt informed of what was happening; on the other hand, he was a ‘buffer’, there to provide 
a measure of protection. Trying to reconcile these roles, he effectively behaved as he would 
on any other matter while operating in the political environment with which he was familiar.

1406

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.207  Mr Smith was diligent, literally to a fault on this occasion, and undoubtedly had discharged his 
duties in an exemplary manner before having to deal with the bid. Despite all that can be said 
on his behalf, he ought nevertheless to have realised that Mr Michel was pushing his way too 
far into the process, by over-familiar means, and that action was required to address that. It is 
regrettable that he did not seek advice from either Mr Hunt or Mr Stephens, or alternatively 
take action himself to put the communications onto a proper footing. Instead, he succumbed 
to Mr Michel’s intimate, surreptitious and conspiratorial language and got ‘way too close’ 
to him, ultimately, as I have concluded, probably passing on confidential information about 
Government thinking which should never have been imparted to News Corp.

5.208  The perception of bias emerges from the exchanges between Mr Smith and Mr Michel. What 
was not evident from the close consideration of events which the Inquiry undertook was any 
credible evidence of actual bias on the part of Mr Hunt. Whatever he had said, both publicly 
and in private, about News Corp or the Murdochs, as soon as he was given the responsibility 
for dealing with the bid the evidence demonstrates a real desire on his part to get it right. His 
actions as a decision maker were frequently adverse to News Corp’s interests. He showed a 
willingness to follow Ofcom’s advice and to take action, to the extent recommended by the 
regulators, in response to the consultation. Even had the deal been approved, it is abundantly 
clear, that it would only have been permitted to proceed subject to very significant and closely 
scrutinised UIL.

6.  News Corp and the Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP
6.1 

The lobbying of Adam Smith was not the only way in which Mr Michel hoped to influence Mr 
Hunt. One of the conduits which Mr Michel sought to exploit calls for examination. Its roots 
lay in the period before Mr Hunt took over responsibility for the bid.

6.2 

During the autumn of 2010, Mr Michel had been in touch with the First Minister for Scotland, 
the Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP. By this stage, Mr Salmond was forging a close relationship with 
Rupert Murdoch and News Corp which is discussed more fully elsewhere in this Report.465 In 
particular, he was hoping to secure the support of The Scottish Sun in the then forthcoming 
2011  Scottish  Parliament  election.  Mr  Salmond  saw  advantage  for  Scotland  in  the  bid’s 
success because News Corp is a big employer in Scotland. He was more than ready to try and 
encourage a successful outcome for the bid. An email from Mr Michel to James Murdoch 
dated  1  November  2010  records  Mr  Salmond’s  position  and  that  of  another  unnamed 
politician466 with a political interest in the bid’s success:467

“Mission accomplished.
–Libdem MP, former Sky employee, with major Sky customer centres in his constituency 
and  around,  will  contact  Vince  Cable  to  ask  him  to  bear  in  mind  the  economic  / 
investment point of view rather than getting influenced by political games, especially 
in  times  of  austerity  and  very  difficult  economic  environment  for  those  areas.  He 
will also emphasise the opportunity for Cable to show the maturity of the Libdems 
as coalition partners, working for the long-term, and will draw from the Coalition

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Igovernment experience lib-dems have had in Scotland. He agrees with the need for 
this to be looked at by Brussels rather than scrutinised again on plurality ground in 
the UK [sic]
–Alex Salmond is very keen to also put these issues across to Cable and have a call 
with you tomorrow or Wednesday. His team will also brief the Scottish press on the 
economic importance of News Corp for Scotland.”(emphasis added)

6.3  Mr Salmond did not quarrel with the thrust of that email and confirmed that he had not only 
spoken to James Murdoch about the bid but also gone on to meet him in London in January 
2011 to discuss the bid and other matters. Mr Salmond explained the importance of the bid 
to Scotland in these terms:468

“It should be understood, I mean, BSkyB is a huge employer in Scotland. We’re talking 
about more than 6,000 full-time jobs in addition to the 2,000 outsourcing jobs and 
temporary jobs. It’s vital in Dumfirmline, Livingston, Uddingston. Some 36 per cent 
of BSkyB’s total global employment is in Scotland. They are in the top 10 of Scottish 
private  sector  employers.  So  it’s  a  matter  of  great  importance  and  the  argument 
being forward by Mr Murdoch was that an expansion of the digital platform on a 
European-wide basis would result in additional investment and that Scotland would 
be well placed in that context to benefit, given the strength of the Scottish offer in 
terms of competitiveness, to benefit from that additional investment.”

6.4  Mr Salmond confirmed that when he had spoken to James Murdoch by telephone the bid 
had been mentioned and that he wanted to discuss the bid with Mr Murdoch when he met 
him:469

“Q.  You refer, though, to the impact of consolidation of BSkyB ownership, so plainly 
you had in contemplation at that stage the BSkyB bid; is that right?
A. That’s correct. Prior to this, it had been indicated I think in a phone call – I’m sure 
in a phone call, actually, because I wanted to meet Mr Murdoch to discuss this in 
particular. This was one of the key things I wanted to discuss, to understand better the 
argument that the consolidation of ownership would result in additional investment 
and that Scotland was well placed. To be fair – well, I’m going to be more than fair, 
they can speak with a great deal of authority, if a company has 36 per cent of its global 
workforce in Scotland, then they speak from a position of some credibility.”(emphasis 
added)

6.5 

He  regarded  it  as  his  duty  to  pursue  jobs  and  investment  for  Scotland  and  denied  any 
responsibility for plurality in the press. He had been prepared to put forward those arguments 
to the relevant Secretary of State but, as things turned out, the opportunity to do so never 
arose:470

“Q.  I  think  it’s  fairly  clear  from  what  you’ve  just  said,  Mr  Salmond,  that  certainly 
from the date of this meeting with Mr James Murdoch you were in favour of the bid. 
Is that right?
A.  Yes. I was in favour of what benefited the Scottish economy. Remember, I have no 
responsibility for broadcasting policy, I have no responsibility for plurality in the press,

1408

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIbut I do have a responsibility for jobs and investment in Scotland. That is my statutory 
responsibility. Indeed, it’s reflected not just in the fact it’s my responsibility, it’s actually 
reflected in our Ministerial Code in Scotland that it is one of the responsibilities that 
you must pursue. So I would tend to put an emphasis on the jobs and investment 
aspects of this. It was for others to consider other matters. And specifically what I 
was prepared to do and said I was prepared to do would have been to speak to the 
relevant Secretary of State to say jobs and investment are going to be a consideration 
along with other things that they had to consider when these matters were brought 
to decision at the appropriate time.
As circumstances turned out, that appropriate time never arose, but I was certainly 
prepared  to  argue  for  that  and  I  would  certainly  say  that’s  entirely  a  legitimate 
preoccupation  and  argument  that  the  First  Minister  of  Scotland  or  any  Scottish 
minister should put forward.” (emphasis added)

6.6 

He said that a purpose of his meeting with James Murdoch in January 2011 had been better 
to understand the potential consequences of James Murdoch’s plans for a European digital 
platform for Scotland:471

“MR JAY: Mr Salmond, before January 2011, were you a supporter of the BSkyB bid 
or not?
A.  What I’d said was that I’d be prepared to argue to the Secretary of State, initially 
Vince  Cable,  or  advance  to  the  Secretary  of  State  the  argument  that  jobs  and 
investment should be taken into account along with other factors, which were their 
responsibility. I never got the opportunity with Mr Cable, because he disappeared 
from  the  scene  for  reasons  you  know  about,  and  as  it  happens,  I  didn’t  get  the 
opportunity with Mr Hunt either, but I was certainly of a mind that I wanted to put 
forward the position that jobs and investment was an important criteria which should 
be taken into account, and the meeting with Mr Murdoch in January which followed 
on a phone call in November, I don’t have a date for it, was because I wanted to 
hear in more detail the connection between the European digital platform investment 
argument and what the consequences might be for Scotland in that respect.
So I was prepared to make that argument and if the circumstances had arisen, then 
I would have made it.”

6.7 

To return to the question of Mr Salmond’s understanding of his role and duty, he made clear 
that he accepted that he knew that Dr Cable and then Mr Hunt were fulfilling a quasi-judicial 
role and had to make their decision insulated from the considerations which Mr Salmond had 
intended to raise. Even this knowledge would not have stopped him from trying to advance 
considerations which would have led the decision maker into error had they been heeded:472

“Q.  Were you advised that Dr Cable was occupying a quasi-judicial role and that he 
had to make the decision insulated from the sort of considerations you might have 
wished to bend his ear about?
A.  Yes.  He  was;  I  wasn’t.  Interestingly,  as  I  said  earlier,  I  don’t  have  responsibility 
for  competition,  I  don’t  have  responsibility  for  plurality  in  the  media.  I  do  have 
responsibility for jobs and investment in Scotland, and the ministerial code, which

Enterprise Act and quasi judicial decision making

1409

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid Iwe may discuss later in terms of politicians and their inter reaction with businesses 
in Scotland.
9.29 of the Ministerial Code of Scotland actually makes the point exactly:
However, nothing in this code should be taken as preventing ministers from fulfilling 
their proper function of encouraging investment and economic activity for the benefit 
and prosperity of the people of Scotland.”
Because within the terms of our remit and responsibilities, what is my responsibility, 
the government’s responsibility obviously takes pre-eminence. And across a whole 
range  of  issues,  whether  it  be  banking  reform  or  oil  taxation  would  be  another 
issue where we don’t currently at least have competence, we nonetheless make an 
argument from the Scottish interest, and while Mr Cable or Mr Hunt, however they 
understood it, and I’m sure they did, were in a quasi-judicial capacity, I wasn’t. My 
capacity was quite clear and my ability to represent was also quite clear.
Q.  I  hadn’t  considered  that  provision  in  the  Scottish  Ministerial  Code  before  but  I 
question, Mr Salmond, whether a very general provision of that nature would entitle 
you, if I may say so, to interfere with a quasi-judicial function which fell to the duty of 
the Secretary of State in London to discharge.
A.  Well,  in  that  case,  can  I  give  you  a  different  example  entirely  where  –  a  very 
controversial  well-known  example,  where  my  colleague  Mr  MacAskill,  the  Justice 
Secretary  of  Scotland,  was  taking  a  quasi-judicial  decision  on  the  compassionate 
release of Mr al-Megrahi, and indeed on the application for prisoner transfer, where 
although he was in a quasi-judicial role he invited opinion and evidence, including 
opinion and evidence from the United Kingdom government.
In the event, they for their own reasons decided not to submit it, but our understanding 
certainly in Scotland, and I’m actually pretty certain it’s the same here, is that people 
are able within their responsibilities to make representation. It is for the Secretary of 
State or the politician concerned who is operating in that capacity to make sure that 
they stay within the bounds of their responsibilities.”

6.8 

Paragraph 9.29 of the Scottish Ministerial Code, 2011 edition, is a part of a section on “Travel 
by  Ministers”  and  falls  under  the  subheading  “Contact  with  Commercial  Companies”.  It 
concerns the promotion of products and services by association and attempts to influence 
public sector procurement and falls to be read in that context. It states:473

“Ministers should also avoid promoting an individual company’s products or services 
by association. They should also bear in mind public sector procurement procedures 
and resist any attempt to influence them in favour of particular products or services. 
If  such  attempts  are  experienced,  Ministers  should  report  these  to  the  Director  of 
Procurement. However, nothing in this Code should be taken as preventing Ministers 
from fulfilling their proper function of encouraging investment in economic activity to 
the benefit and prosperity of the people of Scotland.”

6.9 

The Scottish Ministerial Code starts with the following two paragraphs concerning General 
Principle and Ministerial Conduct:474

1410

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Scottish Ministers are expected to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards 
of propriety.
The Ministerial Code should be read against the background of the overarching duty 
on Ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligation, 
and to uphold the administration of justice and to protect the integrity of public life.”

6.10  On 11 February 2011 Mr Michel met with Mr Salmond’s adviser. The resulting report from 
Mr Michel to James Murdoch is consistent with Mr Salmond’s evidence that he was standing 
ready to speak to Mr Hunt. It also indicates that newspaper coverage and the potential for 
a televised First Ministerial debate were discussed on the same occasion. The email read:475

“I met with Alex Salmond’s adviser today
He will call Hunt whenever we need him to
1  – He noticed a major change in the Sun’s coverage recently. The Daily Record is 
running a very personal campaign against him
2  – He believes the time has come to organise a First Ministerial debate between him 
and Ian Gray [Labour leader], who are the two only possible FM candidates.
He  would  be  very  keen  for  Sky  News  to  organise  it  with  Adam.  There  is  a  timing 
issue as it would have to be organised before dissolution on 22nd March.” (emphasis 
added)

6.11  Asked about the reference to the Sun’s coverage in the above email, Mr Salmond pointed out 
that The Sun did not commit to support the SNP until March 2011, although he seemed to 
accept that there had been something of a change in The Sun’s coverage. His evidence was:476

“Q.  Does that reflect an underlying reality that the Sun was more favourably disposed 
to you and your party at about this time?
A.  I don’t know. Certainly they weren’t – I think the new editor had probably come in 
by this time. The Sun had not declared for the SNP at that time...”

and:

“Q.  I think the gist of your evidence is you wouldn’t disassociate yourself from the 
perception at least Mr Aberdain [Mr Salmond’s adviser] had about the Sun’s coverage; 
is that right?”
A.  I think we did feel that the new editor was treating things a bit differently, but 
certainly at that stage there was no commitment from the editor to support the SNP 
in the election, because that I’m sure came later. In fact, it came in March.”

6.12  The third and final of three emails from Mr Michel to Mr Murdoch to refer to Mr Salmond 
in the context of the bid is dated 2 March 2011, the day before Mr Hunt announced that he 
was minded to accept the UIL in their then form and consequently began the first statutory 
consultation.  It  records  Mr  Salmond  expressly  seeking  help  to  ensure  that  The  Sun  did 
support the SNP at the then forthcoming election. It also confirms Mr Salmond’s continuing 
willingness to support the bid. Insofar as is relevant, it read:477

Chapter 6 | The BSkyB Bid I“Alex Salmond called. He had a very good dinner with the Editor of the Sun in Scotland 
yesterday.
The Sun is now keen to back the SNP at the election. The Editor will make his pitch to 
the Editorial team tomorrow.
Alex wanted to see whether we could help smooth the way for the process.
...
He  also  asked  whether  we  could  go  for  dinner  at  Bute  House  before  the  election 
campaign kicks off on the 22nd March.
On the Sky bid, he will make himself available to support the debate if consultation is 
launched.”(emphasis added)

6.13  Mr Salmond confirmed that he had called Mr Michel. The meal to which he referred was 
one of two meetings which he had had with the editor of The Sun. He had gone to see the 
editor following his meeting with James Murdoch in January (at which he had met Mr Michel 
for the first time). When seeking support on that occasion he had been told to “go and see 
the editor”. He said that what is recorded in the email as a request to smooth things over 
was in fact a plea to prevent London vetoing the Scottish editor’s wish to support the SNP: 
“All  I  wanted  was  a  lack  of  influence.  I  wanted  –  the  editorial  team  were  well  up  for  the 
cup”. He denied that discussion of both the bid and political support for the SNP in the same 
conversation amounted to a subtle and reciprocal exchange of favours.478

6.14  The history of Mr Salmond’s readiness to intervene in the bid, on News Corp’s behalf, is of 
real interest. He stood ready to lobby first Dr Cable and later Mr Hunt, prepared to argue that 
it would be good for Scotland and Scottish jobs. Had he done so he would have been seeking 
to persuade a quasi-judicial decision maker to take into account a factor which was irrelevant 
to the statutory plurality test. Plurality was the only consideration which could legitimately 
have been taken into account by the Secretary of State. Acceding to Mr Salmond’s argument 
would have rendered the decision unlawful.

6.15  Mr Salmond adamantly believed that he was entitled to make his case and that responsibility 
for ensuring that the decision was properly taken rested entirely with the Secretary of State. 
Mr Salmond is right that legal responsibility for taking the decision lawfully rested with the 
Secretary of State. But it does not follow that he was entirely at liberty to seek to persuade 
the  Secretary  of  State  into  error  (particularly,  if  successful,  it  could  potentially  have  had 
the effect of giving rise to grounds for challenge). Neither do I understand how a section of 
the Scottish Ministerial Code dealing with public sector procurement assists. Mr Salmond’s 
duty to promote the Scottish economy and Scottish jobs cannot sensibly be understood as 
requiring irrelevant submissions to be made to a quasi-judicial decision maker.

6.16  The evidence does not go so far as to show either an express or an implied deal between Mr 
Salmond and James Murdoch trading newspaper support for assistance with the bid. What 
it did reveal was the way in which Mr Salmond was expressly seeking the support of The Sun 
in the same conversation as he was repeating an offer to assist with the bid. That occurred in 
the context of a relationship between Mr Salmond and News Corp which had been warming 
since 2007 and was continuing to do so. Mr Salmond’s readiness, when the subject was first 
raised in November 2010 and thereafter, to stand ready to assist News Corp is striking.

Hearing-13-June-2012.pdf 

1412

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI6.17 

I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Salmond was motivated by an anxiety to help Scottish 
employment and to benefit Scotland generally: that is entirely laudable and exactly what is the 
expectation and proper function of the First Minister. How far that should be taken, however, 
is another matter. He appreciated that employment whether in Scotland or elsewhere was 
not a relevant consideration for the Minister and, in fact, he never contacted either Dr Cable 
or Mr Hunt to argue the contrary. Judged by what he did, as opposed to what he said he was 
prepared to do, therefore, he cannot be criticised.

Conclusion

6.18  The handling of  News Corp’s 2010 bid  for BSkyB proved to be an  illuminating case study, 
highlighting the difficulties which politicians face when dealing with acutely sensitive media 
issues, in this instance a plurality decision. The picture which emerged, at a macro level, is 
of a swing from the clear perception of bias against News Corp on the part of Dr Cable in the 
comments he made to his ‘constituents’ to a highly unsatisfactory course of communications 
between Mr Michel and Mr Smith on Mr Hunt’s watch which itself risked a finding of apparent 
bias in favour of News Corp. It involved political lobbying by News Corp, wholly without regard 
to the restricted ambit of the plurality test, and at least one politician  expressing himself 
to be ‘standing ready’ to lobby on grounds  that he was aware were legally irrelevant but 
served his (entirely legitimate) political interests. Had the bid not failed for other reasons, Mr 
Michel’s activities, of which James Murdoch was aware, would have put at risk a favourable 
decision, had one materialised. In that respect not only was their activity misguided, it was 
also ultimately contrary to the interests of News Corp.

6.19 

It is also highly material to issues concerning the relationship between the development of 
policy  (where  we  depend  on  the  democratically  elected  politicians  and  Government)  and 
those who are in a position to use their powerful megaphones to advance causes which they 
support, namely the press (not, of course, constrained by the requirements of impartiality 
imposed on broadcasters). As I have made clear, dialogue between politicians and the press 
is greatly to the benefit of our democracy and entirely in the public interest. Where the public 
interest and private media interests can collide, however, care must be taken to ensure that 
the former prevails and the latter is recognised for what it is.

6.20  The  difficulties  which  the  politicians  concerned  had  with  this  bid  gives  pause  for  thought 
as to whether and, if so, in what capacity politicians ought to be involved in media plurality 
decisions. It is a question on which the Inquiry heard the views of both Dr Cable and Mr Hunt. 
Dr Cable thought it right that politicians ought to be involved.479 Mr Hunt believed that it was 
possible to set aside political and personal views but believed that, by taking and publishing 
advice, he had applied a valuable lock to the process with which to help safeguard it. He could, 
in practice, only depart from the advice if he could convincingly and publicly explain why.480

6.21  A  detailed  consideration  of  the  issues  relevant  to  plurality  is  described  elsewhere  in  the 
Report481 and the issue is not, therefore, taken further in the concluding part of the analysis 
of the bid by News Corp for the remaining shares in BSkyB. What this analysis does reveal, 
however, is that a new approach is essential. Repetition of the problems which arose on this 
bid is undeniably not in the public interest.

FURTHER POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRESS

1.	
1.1

1.3 

1.4 

Introduction
Having  briefly  reflected  on  relationships  between  politicians  and  the  press  from  the 
perspectives of our last five Prime Ministers and brought the narrative up to the present, I 
turn in this Chapter to the viewpoint of a number of politicians currently occupying senior 
positions in UK national life, whose perspectives were of particular interest to the work of 
the Inquiry. The evidence of the Rt Hon Theresa May MP, the Home Secretary, is covered in 
Part G of the Report.

Having concluded the last chapter with the perspective of the current Prime Minister, I turn 
next to the views of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Liberal Democrat party, 
before  moving  on  to  consider  the  views  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  of  the  First 
Minister of Scotland. The section concludes with the evidence of a number of contemporary 
Cabinet Members about their relationships with senior figures in the press.

The Inquiry benefited greatly from all of these unique perspectives. As set out below, the 
personal experiences and approaches of some of these witnesses to handling relationships 
with the press were of particular interest in themselves.

It is inevitable that I have been highly selective (although, I hope, fair) in highlighting a very 
few aspects of the evidence which appear to me to be of particular interest for the purposes 
of the Inquiry. I have also largely confined myself to the words of the witnesses, rather than 
upon any commentary or debate about their perspectives either as received by the Inquiry or 
which have emerged elsewhere. Again, there is no need for me to do so, and there are other 
places (not least Parliament and the press) in which the contest of perspectives about these 
matters can be seen and understood more fully by the public than in the pages of this Report.

2.  The Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP
2.1  Mr Clegg’s evidence was of value not only from the perspective of his current senior position 
in  the  coalition  Government,  but  also  as  leader  of  the  UK’s  ‘third  party’.  Over  the  period 
considered in the previous Chapters of this Report, the Liberal Democrats and their predecessor 
political organisations, being neither in Government nor in the position of Official Opposition 
party, could be expected to have had a very different experience of personal relationships 
at senior levels between the political leadership and senior figures in the press. Mr Clegg 
reminded the Inquiry that the Liberal Democrats had never been politically supported by any 
of the News International titles, and had enjoyed express endorsement, only in recent years 
and to a degree, from The Independent, the Guardian and the Observer. He also reminded 
the Inquiry of his highly personal experience of press coverage in the run-up to the 2010 
general election.

1414

I2.2  Mr Clegg underlined that, in these historical circumstances, he regarded himself and his party 
as removed from the sort of relationship others might have had, with News International in 
particular.1 He said this about relationships between politicians and the press more generally:2

“But it’s really at the end of the day for politicians to stand up for themselves and 
say: look, we have a democratic mandate, we’ve gone out to get elected, we listen 
to  our  constituents  in  our  surgeries  every  Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday.  The  editors, 
the proprietors don’t do that. We get out and about in the country much more, by 
the way, than many of the journalists who constantly pronounce on the state of the 
country. I just think a bit of – an assertion of the legitimacy of politicians to make 
decisions in their own right, unfettered, unintimidated, unpressured, would probably 
go further than almost anything else in making sure the balance is correctly set.”

2.3  Mr Clegg emphasised the sheer importance of interaction between press and politicians:3

“I  can’t  stress  enough…  the  idea  that  politicians  and  the  press  should  operate  in 
hermetically sealed silos separate from each other is completely unrealistic and it’s 
totally right they should seek each other out. It’s just the manner in which they do so 
and the spirit in which they approach each other.”

2.4 

He also underlined the value of the press acting as ‘a very important corrective in the political 
system’,4 putting that in context in this way:5

“I think the balance to strike, however, is to make sure that politicians are not too – 
how can I put it? Not too weak-kneed in face of pressure which they don’t agree with 
or is unwarranted or is unjustified in a mature democracy. The pressure is one thing. 
Intimidation is another. And I think it’s very important to point the finger not just at 
the press but the political class. The more the political class allow themselves over 
time to be intimidated or cajoled or pressured, of course the more it becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy.”

2.5  Mr Clegg’s advice to the Inquiry was to recommend a series of ‘quite precise proposals’ which 
would not be the subject of ‘endless political argy-bargy’ and would stand a good chance of 
cross-party  support.6  He  underlined,  in  addition,  that  the  future  for  press  standards  “has 
to be independent regulation, independent of government, Parliament, politicians and the 
media, with teeth”;7 he saw independence from both press and politicians as important, in 
other words, for a proper and effective system of press standards which would command 
public confidence.

1 He illustrated this memorably by reference to the seating plan at a dinner in December 2009: p27, lines 16-17, Nick 
Clegg, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-13-June-2012.pdf

Chapter 7 | Further Political Perspectives on Relationships with the Press I3.	 The	Leader	of	the	Opposition,	the	Rt	Hon	Ed	Miliband	

3.1 

MP
In his interviews and public statements following the phone-hacking revelations in July 2011, 
Mr Miliband acknowledged that politicians had become ‘too close’ to News International. 
He was asked in oral evidence to explain precisely what he meant by that, and he said this:8

“I’ve obviously read a lot of the evidence you’ve had and thought a lot about this. I 
think the way I very specifically view this – I believe the thing I’m looking for is the 
interview I gave to Andrew Marr, actually, just after the phone hacking Milly Dowler 
scandal broke, because I believe I said in that interview that we were too close, in the 
sense that it meant that when there were abuses by the press, we didn’t speak out. 
That is my version of “too close”, my view of the consequence of “too close”. Now, 
different people – the reason I say I refer to your other evidence is different people 
have used different phrases for that word. Mandelson said “cowed”, Tony Blair said 
“unhealthy”. There’s a whole range of other adjectives that have been used. I suspect 
they may be more accurate as ways of thinking about this issue, that it was a sense 
of fear, I suppose, in some sense, or unwillingness or worry, anxiety about speaking 
out on those issues, issues that were affecting ordinary members of the public, issues 
where I think that if it had been any other organisation in another walk of life that had 
been perpetrating some of what happened, action would have been taken earlier.”

3.2 

3.3 

I made a connection between this analysis and some of the evidence I had heard from previous 
Prime Ministers, including Sir John Major and Mr Blair. The latter, for example, explained that 
for him ‘too close’ should not necessarily be taken to suggest something which was amicable 
and collaborative; the power of the press was also experienced as something creating a degree 
of circumspection in dealing with matters affecting the press’s own reputation and commercial 
interests. I understood Mr Miliband’s comments in that context; that this experience of the 
power of the press led to a correlative reticence in politicians, an unwillingness to speak out 
about problems in the culture, practices and ethics of the press, including those exposed in 
evidence to the Inquiry. Mr Miliband was including himself in that analysis.9

He said that when senior politicians did decide to speak out, this was perceived as ‘crossing 
a Rubicon because this would be seen by News International as pretty much an act of war’.10 
His assessment was that issues of power and influence could not be divorced from issues 
about the concentration of market share in a limited number of hands and the associated 
megaphone effect, and that issues of press misconduct equally could not be divorced from 
the fact of economic power, since it created:11

“...[a]  sense  of  power  without  responsibility,  which  is  what  I  believe  it  was,  came 
from the fact that they controlled 37 per cent of the newspaper market before the 
closure of the News of the World, and I don’t think we can divorce these questions 
of ownership, quasi-monopoly et cetera, from – or at least concentration of power, 
better put than “quasi-monopoly” – concentration of power – I don’t think we can 
divorce those questions from the behaviour of some parts of the press. And add in, 
by the way, the Sky platform, which then became – and Sky. All that became an issue

of the arrogance – and I use the word advisedly; in a way, it’s a mild form of the word 
I might use – came from that.”

3.4 

He set out his commitment to do everything in his power to seek to work on a cross-party 
basis to ensure that the Inquiry’s recommendations provided a basis for the future of press 
regulation. As he put it:12

“I think we have a huge responsibility and I want to say, really, echoing something you 
said at the beginning of this week and something that Tony Blair said in his testimony, 
that for any Prime Minister this is going to be very difficult and I want to say that I 
will do everything I can to seek to work on a cross-party basis so ensure that your 
recommendations provide a framework for us for the future.”

3.5 

On the question of his personal approach, Mr Miliband was asked about his dealings with Mr 
Murdoch and in particular his attendance at the News International summer party on 16 June 
2011. He said this:13

“I say I recall a relatively short conversation with Rupert Murdoch for a few minutes 
at the summer party. I believe it was about US politics and international affairs, and 
I believe I should have raised the issue of phone hacking with him. I didn’t, which is 
something I think I said last summer.”

3.6 

In  his  written  evidence,  Mr  Miliband  was  asked  to  explain  the  circumstances  in  which  he 
hired Tom Baldwin as Director of Communications of the Labour Party on December 2010. Mr 
Baldwin had previously worked at The Times for about 11 years. Mr Miliband’s explanation 
was as follows:14

“A  number  of  candidates  were  considered.  In  respect  of  the  role  which  Tom  was 
appointed  to  fill  we  were  looking  for  someone  with  significant  experience  as  a 
journalist, with an outstanding understanding of the world of politics, and, crucially 
as far as I was concerned, with a genuine commitment to the values of the Labour 
Party.
My then Acting Chief of Staff, Lucy Powell, and I spoke to a number of colleagues, 
associates  and  others  in  whose  judgement  we  had  confidence  –  including  fellow 
politicians and media experts – in connection to Tom, and other candidates’, suitability 
for the role(s) prior to appointing him. At no point did anyone raise concerns about 
Tom’s journalistic integrity. Indeed the opposite was the case ...
Tom  Baldwin’s  connection  to  News  International  was  as  an  employee  of  Times 
Newspapers Limited in which News international has a controlling interest. He was 
not  someone  who  had  close  or  privileged  relationships  with  the  senior  executives 
at  News  International.  His  connections  with  News  International  played  no  role  in, 
and had no significance for, his recruitment. He was employed for his skills and his 
commitment to the Labour party. Neither I nor my Chief of Staff had any conversations 
about Tom’s recruitment with executives of News International.
Before  offering  Tom  Baldwin  the  job  he  and  I  discussed  whether  there  were  any 
reasons why his appointment could be the cause of any embarrassment to either me

Chapter 7 | Further Political Perspectives on Relationships with the Press Ior the Labour Party. This discussion included the references to Tom Baldwin in Lord 
Ashcroft’s book “Dirty Times, Dirty Politics” which was first published in 2005. I should 
underline that the book contains no allegations “linking Mr Baldwin to the unlawful 
and  unethical  acquisition  of  information”.  Lord  Ashcroft  refers  in  his  book  to  Tom 
Baldwin being given information about some of Lord Ashcroft’s financial affairs some 
time after its acquisition by Times Newspapers in defence of a legal action against the 
paper by Lord Ashcroft.
The more serious allegation that Tom Baldwin had himself commissioned the blagging 
of this information was made only subsequently by Lord Ashcroft in a blog in summer 
last year when Tom Baldwin had already been working for me for six months. When 
this was raised with Tom Baldwin (including by me) he made it absolutely clear that it 
was entirely false. My Acting Chief of Staff followed up with the Editor of the Times at 
the time of the events Lord Ashcroft describes – Sir Peter Stothard. He made it clear 
that in his view Lord Ashcroft’s allegation was false. He went out of his way to praise 
Tom Baldwin’s professional integrity and journalistic acumen.”

4.  The First Minister of Scotland, the Rt Hon Alex 

4.1 

Salmond MSP
As I have explained,15 although the remit of this Inquiry extends to all parts of the UK, I have 
not sought to make any recommendations of exclusive application to Scotland (or indeed 
Wales or Northern Ireland). As for Scotland, the pattern of devolved and reserved competence 
in  media  matters  in  Scotland  is  not  straightforward.  For  example,  broadcasting  regulation 
and competition rules in Scotland fall to be dealt with on a ‘reserved’ basis (that is on a UK-
wide  basis,  with  decision-making  resting  with  the  UK  Government  and  Parliament).  Press 
standards, and the commercial interests of the press more generally, fall to be considered on 
a ‘devolved’ basis: the Scottish Government and Parliament can choose either to make their 
own policy and law for national application or to support a UK-wide approach. What follows 
must be considered with that in mind.

4.2  Mr Salmond was asked about his expectations from the Inquiry in terms of the application of 

its recommendations to Scotland. He said this:16

“Well, I think that rather depends on what the Inquiry comes up with, Mr Jay. If the 
Inquiry  comes  up  with  a  proposition  which  accords  with  public  support,  which  is 
eminently sensible and points the way to a better future, then I think the Scottish 
Parliament would be very foolish not to pay close attention to it. If on the other hand, 
which I don’t believe for a minute will happen, it came up with a solution which was 
either over-prescriptive, restricted press liberty, then I think the Scottish Parliament 
might wish not to apply that. So I think that rather depends on the proposition that 
emerges from this Inquiry. I wish you well in the deliberations and I assure you we’re 
looking with enormous interest.”

4.3  Mr Salmond said this, by way of his general views on his personal approach to relationships 

within the press:17

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Q.  ... [s]o are we to understand by that that you will seek to persuade newspapers 
to modify their editorial or reporting stance to reflect the interests of either yourself 
or your party?
A.  Oh yes. I mean, I don’t know of any politician I’ve ever come across who – well, 
if  anybody  doesn’t  answer  yes  to  that  question,  they  certainly  shouldn’t  be  under 
oath  at  an  Inquiry.  All  politicians  try  quite  legitimately  and  properly  to  influence 
newspapers  to  treat  them  or  their  party,  or  in  the  case  of  myself,  their  cause  of 
Scottish  independence,  more  favourably.  That’s  not  the  only  reason  for  meeting 
editors.  Often  there  are  meetings  about  specific  issues,  specific  campaigns,  things 
that are important to that newspaper or important to the government, and a range 
of these meetings would be covered by that category.”

4.4  Mr Salmond spoke about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch: they had evidently made 
significant  personal  connections.  They  shared  Scottish  roots  and  heritage.  Mr  Murdoch’s 
grandfather  was  a  Church  of  Scotland  Minister  within  Mr  Salmond’s  old  constituency. 
Mr Murdoch told the Inquiry that he was ‘intrigued’ by the notion of Scottish independence, 
and  it  is  also  clear  that,  over  time,  he  came  to  be  impressed  by  Mr  Salmond’s  ideas  and 
political acumen.

4.5 

4.6 

4.7 

4.8 

The  personal  element  of  the  relationship  evidently  dated  from  relatively  recent  years. 
Mr Salmond told the Inquiry that he recalled one telephone conversation with Mr Murdoch 
in  November  2000,  shortly  after  the  US  Presidential  election,  but  that  there  was  then  no 
personal contact between them for nearly seven years.

The Scottish Sun, a News International title, was anti-SNP at the 2007 election (as indeed 
was the Daily Record). Mr Salmond’s relationship with Mr Murdoch changed after the 2007 
election.

Bearing  in  mind  the  public  interest  in  the  transparency  of  relationship  between  senior 
politicians  (particularly  in  government)  and  senior  figures  in  the  press,  on  4  August  2011 
Mr Salmond had volunteered to publish a list of his meetings with newspaper proprietors, 
editors and media executives over the preceding years.18 This list, together with more recent 
evidence  to  the  Inquiry,  shows  that  Mr  Salmond  and  Mr  Murdoch  met  on  five  occasions 
over a five year period. The tone of these meetings was said to be warm and friendly.19 Mr 
Salmond also had two meetings with James Murdoch.20

It is apparent from the evidence that these meetings and conversations covered topics such 
as common heritage, the issue of Scottish independence, and (although the evidence was less 
clear about this) corporation tax rates in Scotland. Doubtless Mr Salmond had the opportunity 
on these occasions to explain to Mr Murdoch the advantages, as he saw them, of Scottish 
independence to the latter’s commercial interests. He also invited Mr Murdoch to sporting 
events and the theatre. Significantly, on Mr Murdoch’s side there was an invitation for Mr 
Salmond to be the guest of honour at the formal opening of New International’s Eurocentral 
printing plant on 30 October 2007.

Chapter 7 | Further Political Perspectives on Relationships with the Press I4.9 

BSkyB is a significant employer in Scotland, directly responsible for 6,000 full time jobs and 
2,000 outsourced and temporary jobs. Some 36% of BSkyB’s total global employment is in 
Scotland.21 Mr Salmond’s support for Mr Murdoch’s bid to increase his holdings in BSkyB is 
discussed elsewhere:22 it is clear that he was prepared to lobby UK Ministers in furtherance 
of News Corp’s case. He said that that was with the motive of furthering Scottish economic 
interests,  including  investment  and  employment  opportunities.23  Mr  Salmond  was  also 
hopeful that The Scottish Sun would support him in the May 2011 election, and his evidence 
was that the issue was raised with the Murdochs, for him to be told by them that it was a 
matter for the editors:24

“Q.  Did you ever discuss with Rupert Murdoch or James Murdoch support by their 
newspapers in Scotland for your party?
A.  I find certainly with Rupert Murdoch and with James Murdoch as well that if you 
do that, what they’d say was, “Go to the editors”, and that’s what they say, so you 
just assume that’s what’s going to be said, and they’re perfectly right to say that and 
therefore that’s what I’ve done.
Q.  Can  we  be  clear  on  how  many  occasions  then  you  have  raised  the  issue  with 
Rupert Murdoch and James Murdoch? Are you able to assist us?
A.  I wouldn’t explicitly raise it at meetings necessarily, because they’d always say, 
“Go to the editors”. That certainly was Rupert Murdoch’s practice, and I can’t even 
remember, it may have cropped up in a James Murdoch meeting, but if so, he would 
say, “Go to the editors”, and go to the editors I did, as I say, sometimes successfully 
and sometimes not.
Q.  But that answer presupposes that you made a direct request statement to James 
Murdoch or Rupert Murdoch, “Would your papers support me?” and their answer is 
always, “Go and speak to the editors”; is that right?
A.  No, I don’t think I’ve ever done it explicitly like that. It would be something like, “I 
take it I have to go and speak to the editors to get support for my point of view”. Much 
more like that. It’s chicken and egg. That’s been the position certainly throughout – 
not just in the meetings I’ve had with Rupert Murdoch more recently in the last five 
years, but even if we go back to 2000, 2001. I mean, I can’t speak for other people’s 
experience, but that’s been consistently what he says, so you just accept that’s what 
he’s going to say and therefore you anticipate that, so you don’t actually – I don’t 
think I’ve ever explicitly asked him for support for the party because the answer would 
be, “Go to the editors and argue the position.”
Q.  In your witness statement, the way you formulate it at 13987, eight lines from 
the top of the page, you say quite generally: “In relation to questions about support 
from particular titles, any such discussion with Rupert or James Murdoch was always 
met with a request to talk directly to the relevant editorial team.” So you’re making 
it clear there that if – or rather when you raised such a request with Rupert or James 
Murdoch, they told you to go and speak to the editors?
A.  I refer back to what I said a couple of minutes ago. I think probably the way I put 
it was “I take it I should go and see the sub-editor or go and see the Times editor or 
go and see the Sunday Times editor.”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.10 

It was also put to Mr Salmond that the editorial direction for The Scottish Sun came from 
Rupert Murdoch. His answer was:25

“Not  according  to  Mr  Murdoch.  Mr  Murdoch  would  say  he  was  maybe  part  of 
discussions, but it was up to the editors. He would always say that.”

4.11 

In early March 2011 Mr Salmond made his ‘pitch’ to the editorial team of The Scottish Sun,26 
and  support  from  that  paper  was  forthcoming  later  that  month.  Although  Mr  Salmond’s 
understanding  was  that  Mr  Murdoch’s  editors  rather  than  Mr  Murdoch  personally  would 
decide  which  party  to  support,  Mr  Murdoch’s  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  was  that,  although 
he could not recall the matter specifically, The Scottish Sun’s decision was one to which he 
contributed, and he was also able to explain the basis for it.27 Immediately after the general 
election the editor, Mr Dinsmore, wrote a personal letter of congratulation.28

4.12  The relationship between Mr Salmond and Mr Murdoch after the 2007 Election came to be one 
of mutual respect and admiration, notwithstanding the fact that it was not built on frequent 
interactions between the two (very busy) men. Mr Murdoch could no doubt appreciate that 
he was dealing with a politician of considerable skill, resource and intelligence, and he may 
also have felt, and perhaps continues to believe, that the aims of the SNP are consistent with 
the long-term objectives of both News International and News Corp in Scotland. Mr Salmond 
clearly saw the advantages of securing political support from News International and The 
Scottish Sun, notwithstanding that the 2007 election had led to his becoming First Minister of 
a Coalition Government without support from The Scottish Sun or the Daily Record; and he 
would no doubt wish to do all that was properly within his power to achieve that.

4.13  Mr Salmond had been particularly keen to ensure that the Terms of Reference for this Inquiry 
should make explicit reference to the missed opportunity afforded by Operation Motorman 
to address problems in the culture, practices and ethics of the press. He said this:29

“Well, I am concerned with it because I think there’s a connecting thread which is 
that what seemed to me to be substantive evidence of illegality or illegal practices 
which  was  contained  in  the  Information  Commissioner  –  the  English  and  Welsh 
Information Commissioner’s report, Richard Thomas, I think, of December 2006 had 
been not left unlooked at because there had been a limited number of prosecutions, 
but even, for example, his proposal that breaches of data protection should be an 
indictable offence, as we call it in Scotland, and it’s the same in England, you know, 
had been left, and most recently the revelations on hacking, I mean the connection 
is  obviously  that  there  was  a  substantial  body  of  evidence  that  there  had  been  a 
sequence of perhaps systematic illegal practices going on, and the response of the 
law and those who have responsibility for pursuing these things, whether the police 
or the prosecution services, had not been adequate, and therefore I suggested to the 
Secretary of State that an explicit reference in the terms of reference to Operation 
Motorman would be helpful in making it clear that this was one key aspect, I hoped, 
of the Inquiry’s consideration, and now as it happens, as you know, it was argued to 
me that it didn’t have to be explicit because it was already implicit within the terms

Chapter 7 | Further Political Perspectives on Relationships with the Press Iof reference and fair enough … . I was really thinking of illegal practices. I think it’s 
possible to consider – clearly this Inquiry is considering practices which are improper 
but not necessarily illegal. I mean, there are ways to access people’s data which are 
not illegal  and it might be argued that’s a perfectly proper way to do things. You 
might – but I wouldn’t put my senses on that. I was really driving at the illegality as 
opposed to the propriety.”

4.14  Mr Salmond had this to say about the future:30

“First, and I would give primacy to this, is to uphold the law. I think it’s – my view is it’s 
extraordinary of the various aspects of this that I’ve spoken about that an assumed 
illegality can have been taking place on a huge scale and nothing substantial done 
about it. I made the point earlier about the lack of information that had been given 
to the Scottish authorities, which I feel very angry about. I can give you the assurance 
that’s been given to me by the Lord Advocate that the criminal law will be upheld in 
Scotland without fear and favour, and I’m sure, given the circumstances in which this 
Inquiry has come into being, that will now be the case everywhere, but it has to be the 
case because, unless that’s the case, nothing else that’s suggested – I go back to the 
point – a voluntary or even a statutory code is not going to be enforced or enforceable 
if  the  criminal  law  is  not  being  enforced  and  enforceable  so  I  think  it’s  absolutely 
invites that that’s first in my hierarchy.
Secondly – and maybe this is maybe why you think I’m a minimalist in this matter 
– I think the freedom of the press is important not just as a matter of practice but 
as a matter of principle. And while I salute and applaud those newspapers like, for 
example, the ones I mentioned in DC Thomson and there are others, who make an 
absolute virtue of saying, look, comments are in our editorial or in our columnists, 
fact is in our news columns. That’s great, but it may be desirable but not only is the 
impossible to implement, in my opinion, this division between fact and comment, I 
actually do think there is a freedom for people within the law, the laws of not inciting 
hatred, to conduct themselves in a biased manner. It was Lord Northcliffe, wasn’t 
it, who the phrase the “daily hate” was attributed to, but whether it’s hate or bias, 
whatever you want to call it, I think that’s a price we have to pay for the essential 
freedom of the press and you cannot have a free press which does what you want it 
to do, which always behaves itself. It has to behave itself within the law and within 
certain norms, which I’m going to come onto in a few seconds.
Thirdly,  in  terms  of  redress  from  –  well,  the  redress  for  illegal  behaviour  is  clear 
enough,  that  should  be  a  matter  for  criminal  law  to  enforce  that,  but  from  other 
behaviour which might not be illegal but be wrong, then certainly on that, the redress 
must be open to all. There has to be the ability of individuals or groups, in my opinion, 
to seek redress in an effective manner they can have confidence in. Rich people and 
powerful people will always have the civil courts and actions that they can pursue, 
but to be proper, the redress must be open to all. Fourthly, politicians. I think the move 
towards transparency is a good thing for both government and opposition politicians. 
I think the abidance by the Ministerial Code is – the Ministerial Codes are there for 
a reason and the reason I cited you to Scottish Ministerial Code is because we pay it 
close attention and so politicians and relationships should be guided by transparency 
in terms of what is now being done by everyone –
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Is the Scottish Code in your exhibits?

30 pp98-101, lines 9-14, ibid 

1422

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIA.  I cited it earlier on, sir. If we haven’t made it an exhibit, then I shall make sure it 
is done.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I’d be grateful if you could send me a copy.
A.  And obviously the differences would tend to be it stresses areas where the Scottish 
ministers have particular competence, like the one on jobs and investment that I read 
out to you. But following the Ministerial Code is my fourth point. –”

5.  The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP
5.1 

Kenneth Clarke QC MP provided a number of different perspectives. In particular, as Lord 
Chancellor  and  Justice  Secretary  at  the  time,  his  Cabinet  portfolio  included  a  number  of 
matters of central concern to the Inquiry, including substantive and procedural law on both 
the civil and criminal sides, access to justice more generally, and data protection law and 
policy.

5.2 

He said this about the political response to Operation Motorman:31

“That was the startling thing, but I don’t think you can put that down to the Information 
Commissioner. The Motorman reports were pretty startling, and rather going back to 
what I said before, what is known in the bubble and what’s known outside, I think 
every knew that private and confidential information was fairly readily available in 
the outside world as long as you were prepared to pay for it, and the Commissioner 
produced these two reports and not much was done about it, but it goes beyond, I 
think, just the penalties and the powers of the Information Commissioner.
Q. You say not much was done about it. What other reasons do you think exist for why 
not much was done about it?
A. Well, it’s no good mentioning my pet theories because I don’t know for sure, but 
what this Inquiry is looking into, how far was it a desire, for one reason or another, 
not to upset the people who were happily indulging in all this? I won’t go further. 
It’s not totally new, all this. When I was first appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
I had to move my bank account because my bank complained to me that journalists 
were trying to bribe the staff of the village branch where I had my bank account. It 
would have been regarded as perfectly customary in those days, I think particularly 
as the Chancellor of the Exchequer who had been appointed had views which weren’t 
shared by some the editors of the more vigorous newspapers. So that and various 
other things happened. And in business everybody was perfectly well aware that if 
you wanted to engage in these sort of practices, it was terrible easy to get details of 
the private information of your competitors or rivals, and journalists joined in the 
same  thing.  The  scale  of  it  appears  to  become  startling.  Motorman  sort  of  made 
people aware this had now grown to a very profitable and large industry, and even 
following through the newspapers the evidence given to this Inquiry, the scale has 
certainly shocked me, when I would have thought I was fairly worldly wise on the 
subject in previous years, but I had no idea it was going on on this monumental scale.”

5.3  Mr  Clarke  spoke  in  these  general  terms  about  relationships  at  senior  levels  between  the 

politicians and the press:32

1423

Chapter 7 | Further Political Perspectives on Relationships with the Press I“Well, what falls in force with your remit is as it were the proprietors of it, isn’t it? I 
mean, how far is undue influence being exercised for commercial, well, political, other 
reasons? The politics are quite difficult because in the end it is for the politicians to 
decide how far they’re going to allow a particular powerful group to influence policy. 
If I’m sounding – every democratically elected politician in every part of the world 
I’ve ever known easily falls to criticising the press, so if I sound as if I’m criticising the 
press, my criticisms are actually aimed equally at the ministers.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I understand that.
A. When taken to excess, this terror of the tabloids and this subservience to the media 
doesn’t give any success to the politician who does it. You may win some temporary 
praise, but you make stupid decisions in government and they turn on you eventually 
when  it  starts  to  fall  apart.  You  still  come  to  the  same  ruin  in  the  end  unless  you 
actually make a decent fist of the good governance of the country.
...
Well, in my opinion the power of the media has grown, is excessive, and ought to be 
diminished, although I think the remedy is as much in the hands of the politicians as 
others. On the other hand, I still want to have a free media, an aggressive media, an 
irreverent media, and one that continually questions the government’s own estimate 
of itself, so you have to get the balance right between those two.”

5.4 

Of particular interest was the example that Mr Clarke was able to provide relating to criminal 
justice policy over recent years which, in his view, ‘has been a response to tabloid newspaper 
complaints’.33 Overall:34

“If the tone of the newspapers had been different for the last 15 years, we’d probably 
have 20,000 fewer prisoners in prison. I hasten to add that’s not a scientific estimate, 
it’s just a way of illustrating my opinion.”

5.5 

He also challenged the theory that the endorsement of political parties from time to time by 
The Sun really made much difference to the political fortunes, since Rupert Murdoch and his 
newspaper tended to align themselves with perceived winners and to change sides ‘when it 
was obvious that the horse they’re riding is about to collapse’.35

5.6 

On the way forward on press regulation, Mr Clarke observed:36

“I think we’re all agreed, I don’t know, you’ve had many witnesses now, that whoever 
the regulator is must be totally independent of both government and press in their 
activities, that they should have some authority, and the ability to require the relevant 
media organisations to subject themselves to the authority, and that they should have 
the power to impose penalties so there is some practical effect. Financial penalties, I 
imagine, the most part. It’s when they break the criminal law, it should go off to other 
courts and other jurisdictions to deal with that. If that needs statutory underpinning 
because you won’t get everybody to produce something like that and join something 
like that, submit to something like that and comply with something like that, then 
you’re going to need statutory underpinning...”

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.7  Mr Clarke subsequently reverted to the Inquiry in writing on 26 July 2012.37 Of particular value 
was his comment about the care needed when considering remedies for press misconduct in 
the wider civil law context, and his view that a measure of statutory underpinning for a new 
regime “would not be the freedom of expression Armageddon some commentators would 
have you believe”.38

6.  The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP
6.1  Mr  Gove’s  perspective  is  interesting  in  two  principal  respects.  First,  he  is  both  a  senior 
politician  and  a  former  journalist  (including  having  been  news  editor  for  The  Times). 
Second, in his capacity as Secretary of State for Education, he had also had some experience 
interacting with senior News International interests on public policy issues within the remit 
of his Department.

6.2 

From the perspective of his experience in journalism, Mr Gove offered some insights into the 
relationship between politicians and the press. He said this:39

“I can quite understand why Lord Mandelson thought that the relationship between 
politicians  and  journalists  was  a  purely  transactional  one.  I  prefer  to  think  of  the 
relationship between politicians and journalists as being nuanced and multi-layered. 
Sometimes it will be the case that some politicians will regard their interactions with 
journalists in a transactional fashion, but it can also be the case that friendships can 
arise and it can certainly be the case that politicians can understand the pressures 
that journalists face in trying to make sure that the public are informed and it can 
also be the case that journalists can appreciate the pressures that politicians face in 
trying to make sure that their policy is presented fairly.
Q.  Thank you. In your view, have we reached the point where the current state of 
relationships between journalists and politicians is poisonous or close to it?
A.  No, I don’t believe it’s poisonous.
Q.  Have we reached anywhere near that point?
A.  No, I don’t believe we have. Of course there’s acrimony between some journalists 
and some politicians as a result of wrongs or perceived wrongs, but I think that the 
idea that the relationship is poisonous is an overstatement.
Q.  Are there any aspects of the relationship, if one doesn’t like the word “poisonous”, 
one might characterise as unhealthy?
A.  I think it’s certainly the case that there are sometimes elements of the relationship 
between  politicians  and  journalists  that  can  be  a  little  rough-edged.  I  think  that’s 
certainly  true.  And  it  is  also  the  case  that  there  are  some  politicians  and  some 
journalists who develop, over time, a close relationship, which may not altogether be 
in the public interest. But in my experience, most politicians and most journalists have 
a proper sense of the boundaries between each.
Q.  So a close relationship which may not altogether be in the public interest, why not 
altogether in the public interest?

Chapter 7 | Further Political Perspectives on Relationships with the Press IA.  It may be the case sometimes that a relationship between certain journalists and 
certain politicians will involve a journalist or a politician relying one upon the other 
for confidences which are not always shared with the public at an appropriate time.”

6.3  Mr Gove provided his personal view of Rupert Murdoch, with whom he clearly has a close 
affinity.  Initially  expressing  himself  in  fairly  succinct  terms  (“I  think  that  he  is  one  of  the 
most impressive and significant figures of the last fifty years”), he broadened his insights as 
follows:40

“I think that the changes that he made to newspaper publishing as a result of his 
decision to relocate his titles to Wapping lowered the barriers to entry for newspapers 
and  meant  that  like  the  Independent,  which  would  never  otherwise  have  existed, 
existed, and as a result more individuals have been employed in journalism. It’s also 
the case that his investment in satellite television has also created jobs as well, and 
I  think  that  it’s  undoubtedly  the  case  that  there  are  few  entrepreneurs  who  have 
taken risks in the way that he has and therefore generated employment, but also 
controversy in the way which he has.
Q.  And the generation of controversy, how does that arise or how has that arisen?
A.  It’s often the case that successful people invite criticism. He has been successful in 
a particular industry, where there are others who are only too happy to criticise, and 
they have exercised their liberty to do so.
Q.  You described him, consistently with the evidence you’ve just given, as a force of 
nature, a phenomenon and, I think, a great man. That’s right, isn’t it?
A.  Yes, it is. I enjoyed meeting him when I was a journalist, I subsequently enjoyed 
meeting him when way a politician and I would also say that as well as having been 
a successful businessman, I think that the position that he took on, for example, the 
European single currency, has been vindicated by events.
Q.  Have you ever expressed a view on the merits of the BSkyB bid, Mr Gove?
A.  Never to any of my political colleagues, no.
Q.  So insofar as you held a view about it, by definition it would have been a private 
view?
A.  Correct.”

6.4  Mr Gove was taken at some length41 through documentary evidence which related to Mr 
Murdoch’s interest in investing in free schools and academies, and his own involvement in 
that project. Some commentators have seen this evidence as a legitimate cause for concern 
about what may have appeared to be an ‘overly close’ relationship between Government and 
proprietors in which matters of Government policy are transacted in the context of friendly 
personal relationships. Although the evidence was explored in detail with a view to testing 
that proposition, no substantive grounds for public concern were established. Although Mr 
Murdoch’s  commercial  interests  were  clearly  engaged  at  one  level,  Mr  Gove  expressed  a 
clear view that Mr Murdoch’s interests, such as they were, in the free school movement were 
essentially philanthropic.42 In any event, nothing came of Mr Murdoch’s interest; the project 
foundered for want of local authority funding support.43

staff, between 2005 and 2010.46 Approximately one-third of these were with representatives 
of News International. Asked, by way of example, about a dinner hosted by Rebekah Brooks 
on 19 December 2009 and attended by Rupert and James Murdoch, Mr Osborne said this:47

‘I’m  sure  political  matters  were  discussed.  I  mean,  they  normally  were.  I  don’t 
remember  any  improper  conversation  or  any  conversation  about  the  commercial 
interests of News Corp or News International. I think it was a general discussion about 
the political situation in Britain as we were heading into a General Election year and 
indeed  the  economic  situation  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  I  mean,  normally  when 
Rupert Murdoch was at one of these events, the conversation was about the global 
economy and at the time, of course, we were right in the middle of the financial crisis.’

ConClusions and re Commendations

Introduction
The subject-matter of Module Three was the contacts and relationships between national 
newspapers and politicians, and the conduct of each, considered in the overall context of the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press. Pausing to take stock, it is first worth restating what 
context led to the inclusion of this Module in the Inquiry’s terms of reference.

The questions the Inquiry looked at in Module Three were these: was there something amiss 
in the relationship between the press and the politicians? And if so, was it connected to the 
current state of press standards? Most importantly, was there a genuine issue of public trust 
and confidence here which ought to be addressed? Were politicians to any degree a ‘part of 
the problem’ of press standards and of public concern about them?

The relationship between the politicians and the press is, as I said at the outset, part of the 
vital lifeblood of democracy. It is also an unbalanced relationship in one important respect: 
the politicians are directly answerable to the public for it. So in asking the Inquiry to reflect on 
this matter, it was effectively being directed to the question of whether there has been some 
shortcoming in the democratic processes of accountability for the relationship.

It is important to make that point clear because, in one sense, the politicians made the issue 
straightforward. The cross-party consensus at the time the Inquiry was set up was, in itself, 
at least a partial answer to the question of whether there was a legitimate issue of public 
confidence. The commissioning  of a judge-led Inquiry, and particularly an Inquiry running 
in parallel with extensive criminal investigations, cannot be regarded simply as a matter of 
placing a complex and sensitive set of policy issues into a forensic context for the purposes 
of  gathering  and  analysing  evidence  for  future  decision  making  (although  it  was  certainly 
all of that). At some level, it must also be understood to be an acknowledgment that there 
would be value in considering the matter, from an independent and objective perspective, 
removed  from  the  context  of  Government  and  Parliament  where  such  matters  are  more 
usually considered. 

In conducting Module Three, I have been very mindful of the responsibility to maintain political 
objectivity and of questions of public perception. The subject matter is both of real public 
interest and is also interesting to the public: the evidence ranged over important issues of 
accountability, and it is clear that the public took a close interest in what witnesses (including 
some of the leading politicians of our time) had to say about them. In the circumstances, 
I have sought to ensure a very high level of transparency in all that has been undertaken. 
This  means  that  everyone  can  make  their  own  minds  up  directly,  while  at  the  same  time 
reflecting on the political commentary and the mediation of the press. I have also repeatedly 
emphasised the non-partisan context of the work of the Inquiry. 

1.6 

In contrast, the contemporaneous commentary on the evidence was vigorously partisan, as it 
was fully entitled to be. Among the large number of thought-provoking questions about the 
relationship between the politicians and the press which were raised in the process, I have 
had to be highly selective, and so not lose sight of the remit set out in the Terms of Reference. 

1428

I1.7  My focus in these concluding pages is not on individual politicians or political parties. I have 
concentrated entirely on long-term patterns of behaviour as they might be perceived by the 
public, observing from the outside the relationship between the politicians and the press. 
The evidence contained many examples from which these patterns clearly emerge. No doubt 
there is unlimited scope for debate and value-judgment about the relative contribution to 
the pattern of one example rather than another. For my part, however, I do not intend to take 
any part in that debate. 

1.8 

1.9 

I have also been conscious that politicians (and not only those in Government to whom I 
formally report) hold the future of this Report in their hands; it is they who must now be 
finally and fully responsible and accountable to the public for dealing with it. To that extent, 
I am bringing the story full circle. I have concluded that, in some ways, the conduct of the 
relationship between politicians and the press has been a part of the problem. Now, however, 
that relationship has to hold the key to the solution.

The problem revolves around one principal public concern; put simply it is that the relationship 
has  become  ‘too  close’.  Politicians  have  used  that  term  themselves  and  the  Inquiry  has 
explored  what  is  meant  by  it.  The  definitions  and  explanations  provided  have  not  always 
been the same, nor, indeed, has been the public perception of this problem. 

1.10  A number of features have been mentioned. First, there is the power of proprietors and the 
risk  that  it  has,  in  itself,  stifled  political  comment  about  the  power  of  the  press,  contrary 
to the public interest. Second, there is the question about how politicians have conducted 
themselves in relation to that power in all its manifestations. Third, the sheer quantity of 
meetings between senior editors, proprietors and politicians has raised concern about the 
perception that, on occasion, understandings could have been reached or deals struck well 
out of public sight. 

1.11  There have been further public concerns. They include first, the issue of failure by politicians 
to  speak  out  in  the  face  of  the  growing  evidence  of  criminal  wrong-doing  and,  secondly, 
that personal relationships and friendships have been allowed to develop, with the risk that 
appropriate boundaries have become blurred and, potentially, led to errors of judgment.

1.12  However the term ‘too close’ is exactly defined, the question has boiled down to this issue: 
have there been unaccountable exchanges in influence and favours, trading political support 
and  advancement  (or  the  avoidance  of  political  damage)  for  policies  which  favour  the 
commercial interests of the press, however defined, or the abstention from policies which 
would disfavour those interests? Less starkly, but no less important, are there aspects of the 
close relationship between politicians and the press which should just very simply be less 
close, or which the public should be able to know more about so that they can make their 
own minds up about it?

1.13  Generally speaking, I have considered the issue on a chronological basis, taking the last five 
Prime Ministers over three periods of time, corresponding with the periods of power of their 
respective parties, and examining their relationship with the press; and then by scrutinising 
the issue through the lens of a series of policy and legislative developments, culminating in a 
close examination of the BSkyB bid. This last episode has been analysed in detail for a number 
of reasons. First, because of its currency and the quantity of evidence, both documentary 
and oral, which was brought to bear on it. Second, the story allows a clear focus on a number 
of  aspects  of  the  relationship  between  the  press  and  the  politicians.  Third,  the  evidence 
available,  and  the  fact  that  the  case  involved  a  decision  with  a  legal  (and  quasi-judicial) 
dimension, makes it possible to analyse it forensically. 

1429

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI1.14  Module Three has also addressed a number of issues in which the press themselves have 
expressed a particular interest. These include ‘spin’, so-called anonymous briefings and the 
practice of ‘feeding’ favoured journalists with stories in return for an expectation of a certain 
type of treatment in the telling of those stories by the newspapers involved. These issues 
are not central to the work of the Inquiry for a number of reasons. On examination, some of 
the matters of which complaint is made turn out to fall within the spectrum of what might 
fairly be described as the rough and tumble of politics and political journalism. Some are 
inevitably too impressionistic and partial to bear much analysis. And it is also problematic to 
conceive of any practical recommendations which might be crafted to address these issues. 
I do recognise, however, that there is a genuine issue of public perception and confidence 
here, to which the Report can do some service if only by holding up a mirror.

1.15  The principal focus of Module Three has been the relationship between politicians and News 
International. This has been inevitable. The Prime Minister, echoed by others, summed up 
the problem: ‘we all got too close to News International’. Mr Murdoch’s titles still have the 
largest market share in the UK despite the demise of News of the World, and Mr Murdoch 
himself has exercised enormous fascination in the public imagination over some 40 years. He 
has been demonised in some quarters and lauded in others, to the extent that one might be 
entitled to observe that a moderate view about the man would be unorthodox. Moderate or 
otherwise, a balanced assessment is required for these purposes in the context of the specific 
issues which arise under the Terms of Reference. 

1.16  The  purpose,  therefore,  of  this  concluding  Chapter  of  this  Part  of  the  Report  is  to  draw 
the  various  strands  together  and  so  found  an  evidential  basis  and  justification  for  the 
recommendations that I feel it right to make. I first examine the relationships between the 
press and politicians specifically from the perspective of the proprietors who gave evidence 
before the Inquiry: this will be achieved in fairly general terms, because Part I Chapters 2-4 
has already addressed these topics in detail, albeit specifically from the perspective of the 
politicians. I will then set out some general conclusions as to the ways in which the relationship 
between politicians and the press seems to have fallen out of line with the public interest. 
Finally, I will draw some wider conclusions which will lead onto my recommendations.

2.  the proprietors

2.1 

Rupert Murdoch
Those who are expecting a series of revelatory insights into the career and personality of 
Rupert Murdoch will be disappointed by what follows. I say this for at least two reasons. First, 
as those who have written biographies about him would no doubt explain, the time at the 
Inquiry’s disposal to investigate Mr Murdoch’s lengthy career was limited in comparison with 
the breadth and depth of exploration necessary for such a subject. There was considerable 
ground for Counsel to cover and, in addition to pursuing the wider interests of the Inquiry, 
it was important that Mr Murdoch was able to say what he wanted about the various issues 
that have cost his company so dear.

2.2 

Second, the Inquiry remains constrained by the ongoing criminal investigations, at least as 
regards those aspects of Mr Murdoch’s evidence which bore on Module One and the saga 
of phone hacking. Sir John Major made the point in evidence that what he considered to be 
the less than acceptable state of the culture, practices and ethics of the press is attributable 

1430

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.3 

to the acts and omissions of proprietors and editors.1 However, as I have already explained, 
this is the sort of issue that criminal proceedings rightly preclude the Inquiry from exploring, 
save in very general terms, not least because the only conduit from the conduct of journalists 
to Mr Murdoch is the layers of editorial and other management that separated him from the 
news room floor none of whom could be asked about the matter. This means that there are 
clear limits on the basis of the evidence I have heard to what I can say about Mr Murdoch’s 
leadership and his responsibility, if any, for this aspect of the culture, practices and ethics of 
the press.

There are no similar inhibitions operating on me in relation to those aspects of Mr Murdoch’s 
evidence  which  covered  Module  Three  issues,  although  I  naturally  bear  in  mind  that  an 
enormous  amount  of  evidential  ground  had  to  be  covered  in  a  relatively  compressed 
timescale. Furthermore, the events in question covered a 31 year period (the acquisition of 
The Times and its associated titles was in January 1981) and Rupert Murdoch was 81 years of 
age when he testified. Notwithstanding that he is plainly extremely astute, some allowances 
need to be made for the fact that, over a two day period, he was being asked to give wide-
ranging evidence and being taken, in the course of that evidence, to documents which were 
numerous, complex and diverse. It is not necessarily unreasonable that he may not always 
have given direct answers to the questions posed, and was not always able to recall events. 
It is also necessary to reiterate that Mr Murdoch is the Chairman and CEO of a world-wide 
media empire, and however dear to his heart newspapers may be as a whole, or The Sun 
newspaper in particular, his time has to be rationed and certain responsibilities delegated. 

2.4  Mr  Murdoch’s  relationships  with  various  British  Prime  Ministers  have  been  considered  in 
depth above, and in this Chapter, I come to the heart of the matter. He denied on several 
occasions that he made any express deals with politicians, and the available evidence does 
not prove that he ever did. This, however, is not the end of the story. 

2.5 

2.6 

This  Report  is  not  the  place  to  comment  on  Mr  Murdoch’s  undeniable  business  acumen. 
On any basis, I have absolutely no doubt that he is a newspaper man through and through, 
and that he has developed a serious and abiding interest in politics and current affairs. An 
iconoclast in a number of respects, and certainly not an establishment figure, Mr Murdoch’s 
position (which may be as the most powerful newspaper magnate in the English-speaking 
world, or at least one of them), has brought him into contact with all the leading politicians 
inhabiting that environment, from Australia to the USA. It is inevitable that he should get 
on better with some than others, but it is also clear from the evidence that he is a man who 
enjoys political argument and debate with those who are at the centre of this universe.

If Mr Murdoch made no express deals with politicians within government, the question which 
arises is whether he made any implied deals or reached tacit understandings with those who 
engaged with him. In this regard it is necessary to define terms carefully because there is a 
clear danger of permitting a lack of precision in the question to suggest or indicate what the 
answer to it might be. Instead, it may be better simply to set out what inferences, if any, may 
reasonably be drawn from Mr Murdoch’s conduct over the years. 

2.7 

All  the  politicians  who  gave  evidence  before  the  Inquiry  said  that  Mr  Murdoch  exercised 
immense power and that this was almost palpable in their relations with him. Mr Blair spoke 
in terms of his acute awareness of the power that was associated with him.2 This is not to

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI2.8 

2.9 

say that Mr Murdoch set out to wield power or that his personal manner was other than 
amicable and respectful in his dealings with politicians. But it is to say that he must have been 
aware of how he was being perceived by his interlocutors; to suggest otherwise would be 
to suggest that Mr Murdoch knows little about human nature and lacks basic insight, which 
could not, of course, be further from the truth.

Rupert Murdoch accepted that The Sun broadly reflected his worldview.3 His editors would 
not need to ask him for his opinion on any particular topic; they would know his thinking on 
the issues of the day in general terms, and could work out what it would be likely to be in any 
specific instance. Some have likened this process to the workings or metaphorical radiations 
of the Sun King, but, in fact, it is no more than basic common sense. Editors at The Sun, and 
probably also the News of the World, could form a pretty good idea of what their proprietor 
wanted without having to ask. It follows from this that, for example, the position The Sun 
took in relation to Lord Kinnock’s personality and policies through the 1980s and right up to 
the general election of 1992 was consistent with Mr Murdoch’s assessment of the man, even 
if the proprietor did not necessarily encourage all his paper’s methods and rhetoric.

It  is  the  ‘without  having  to  ask’  which  is  especially  important  here.  Sometimes  the  very 
greatest  power  is  exercised  without  having  to  ask,  because  to  ask  would  be  to  state  the 
blindingly obvious and thereby diminish the very power which is being displayed. Just as Mr 
Murdoch’s editors knew the basic ground-rules, so did politicians. The language of trades 
and  deals  is  far  too  crude  in  this  context.  In  their  discussions  with  him,  whether  directly 
or by proxy, politicians knew that the prize was personal and political support in his mass 
circulation newspapers. The value or effect of such support may have been exaggerated, but 
it has been treated as having real political value nonetheless. 

2.10  Turning the tables round, as it were, Mr Murdoch was also well aware that political support 
was what his interlocutors were seeking.4 Equally, politicians were well aware that ‘taking on’ 
Mr Murdoch would be likely to lead to a rupture in support, a metaphorical declaration of 
war on his titles with the inevitable backlash that would follow. What might count as taking 
him on would have to be seen from Mr Murdoch’s point of view, and in the context of a 
continuing and complex relationship. Mr Murdoch knew this too. 

2.11  These factors, taken together, would be likely to lead to an appreciation of the consequences 
both of disturbing the status quo as regards the regulation of the press and, more broadly 
speaking,  of  adopting  policies  which  would  damage  Mr  Murdoch’s  commercial  interests. 
Politicians’ interests, in other words, would find themselves highly aligned with Mr Murdoch’s. 

2.12  Put in these terms, the influence exercised by Mr Murdoch is more about what did not happen 
than what did. To reiterate: a case by case examination of the policies which were introduced 
over this long period fails to demonstrate that politicians compromised themselves or their 
policies  to  favour  Mr  Murdoch’s  business  interests  directly.  Where  a  decision  pleased  Mr 
Murdoch, there would always be other public-policy reasons for it. At least one administration 
introduced many policies to which, by any stretch of the imagination, Mr Murdoch would not 
have been well disposed. But no government addressed the issue of press regulation, nor of 
concentration of ownership.

2.13  Another  important  factor  is  that  Mr  Murdoch  fully  understood  the  value  of  personal 
interactions,  the  value  of  the  face-to-face  meeting.  His  (self-invited)  lunch  with  Baroness

1432

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIThatcher  on  4  January  1981  exemplifies  this  point  in  microcosm.  Mr  Murdoch  was  not 
necessarily  expecting  any  favours  from  Baroness  Thatcher  but  he  was  investing  in  her 
nonetheless, seeking to impress on her his personal qualities as a risk-seeking entrepreneur 
who shared political affiliations with the Prime Minister and, although he never made the 
argument explicitly, why he should be regarded as the favoured bidder for The Times. There 
is no evidence that Baroness Thatcher sought in turn to persuade her Secretary of State of 
Mr Murdoch’s qualities, but had there been a conversation between the two of them Mr 
Murdoch had the comfort of knowing that he had taken the opportunity of advancing his 
own case. In any event, if the lunch had been known about at the time, that itself would have 
been significant. Suffice to say, Mr Murdoch well understands the value of ‘less is more’.

2.14 

Viscount Rothermere
I am grateful for the evidence Viscount Rothermere provided to the Inquiry, but for these 
purposes it is possible to address it quite briefly. He recognised the power wielded by the 
press, including by his own titles, but an assessment of his evidence overall does not suggest 
that this was a power which he was particularly keen to wield; he left it to others to do so. 

2.15  Viscount Rothermere was concerned to explain the distinction he said he made in his own 
mind between overt campaigning activity on a matter of general public interest, or on issues 
of commercial concern to his newspaper, which in his view should take place with Ministers 
and  officials  on  the record,5  and  social  interactions  with  politicians  where, as  he put  it, it 
might be seen as not very good manners to raise particular problems.6 This distinction was 
encapsulated in this way:7

“Well, I don’t – I think that if I see a politician and they want to talk about general 
politics and they want to talk about – they want to explain their views and I want a 
general understanding of what’s going on, then that’s appropriate in one scenario. 
If I have specific issues that I wish them to understand over something like the EU 
privacy directive or local television, I think that’s best done in a business environment, 
where everything is on the record. Frankly, I think it’s the – it protects them and it 
protects me from insinuations of undue access. That’s how I operate, anyway. Or try 
to operate.”

2.16  This  was  straightforward  evidence,  both  in  its  ethical  compass  and  its  recognition  of  the 
problems  of  public  perception  which  attach  to  both  parties  to  these  interchanges:  the 
‘insinuations  of  undue  access’  was  Viscount  Rothermere’s  pungent  turn  of  phrase  and 
identified the very core of the problem.

2.17  Viscount  Rothermere  also  explained  that,  on  occasion,  he  was  at  the  receiving  end  of 
representations of a different sort from politicians discontented with their coverage in the 
Daily Mail in particular. He explained that he saw it as his role, when appropriate, to draw 
these complaints to the attention of his editor:8

“Certainly,  when  I’ve  had  meetings  with  politicians,  they  have  expressed  –  of  all 
parties – expressed unhappiness with some of the coverage in the newspaper. Largely, 
I refer them back to Paul Dacre, but if there is an instance which I feel justifies merit,

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsIthen I may well bring that up with Paul and say that – and recommend that he look 
into it and talk to that politician to seek out the truth. So if they say that we’ve run 
something which is blatantly untrue, and that is probably – I won’t get involved on a 
level of opinion, but if someone comes to me and says, “Your newspaper has printed 
an  untruth,  it  is  categorically  a  mistake”,  then  I  will  say  to  Paul,  “This  person  has 
written to me”, and it is normally a letter, “complaining about this which they say 
is untrue, would you please look into it” and he and the legal team look into it and 
either talk to the politician and sort it out directly or write back to me and say that 
there is no truth in it – sometimes people have a different opinion as to truth.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So it’s just a system that’s built up. It’s not something that 
you’ve made known?
A. No, I – well, yes, it’s not something I’ve made known, and to be honest, I don’t 
really invite it, because I don’t think that is – I don’t wish to get into a position of 
having to constantly deal with this issue because obviously the newspaper is writing 
controversial things all the time, so it is –”

Aidan Barclay

2.18  Mr  Barclay  gave  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  of  Telegraph  Media 
Group Ltd, a position which he has occupied since July 2004.9 The Barclay family own a range 
of other business enterprises including other print titles, and the media as a whole is perhaps 
a less important part of their undertakings than some of the other proprietors from whom 
the Inquiry has heard.

2.19  Aidan Barclay explained that it is his practice to accord complete editorial freedom to his 
titles.10 The Telegraph titles support the Conservative Party at general elections but regularly 
criticise Conservative Governments and politicians.11 Mr Barclay made it clear that he does 
not  ask politicians  for favours, and  none  are returned; his  discussions  with  politicians  are 
largely of a general political and economic nature.12 His SMS text message communications 
with  David  Cameron,  particularly  in  May  2010,  are  addressed  elsewhere  but  bear  out  his 
evidence  in  this  respect.  No  doubt  Mr  Barclay’s  principal  concern  is  the  macro-economic 
environment in which his wide-ranging business interests will inhabit.

2.20  Mr  Barclay’s  evidence  as  to  his  various  dealings  with  the  last  three  Prime  Ministers  is  as 

follows:13

‘I have known each of the last three Prime Ministers. My relationships with each of 
them have been cordial and sporadic: I would not describe them as particularly close. 
I saw Tony Blair on a number of occasions, and if my memory serves on almost every 
occasion (other than dinner) Jonathan Powell was in attendance. As is widely recorded, 
Mr Blair’s approach to such meetings was relaxed and social. He was interested in 
the press but I do not recall him ever raising specific editorial matters with me, or 
suggesting that the Telegraph titles might adopt a different political stance.…
I had a number of meetings with Gordon Brown when he was Prime Minister. He was, 
as is well known, interested in the granular detail of economic policy and we spoke 
often about economic theories and the state of British business. I saw him more than

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIother  Prime  Ministers  because  of  the  extraordinary  times  we  were  living  through 
following the collapse of Northern Rock and then of Lehman Bros. Mr Brown was 
keen to get my views on the impact on business, and I would sometimes send him 
articles  and  books  I  thought  he  should  see.  He  was  also  Prime  Minister  when  the 
scandal of MPs’ expenses broke, and he must have raised this with me in general 
terms; but as with Mr Blair I do not recall him ever asking me to intervene in editorial 
matters as he was aware of my own views on editorial independence.
I first met Mr Cameron where he was a candidate to become leader of the Conservative 
party,  and  I  have  had  meetings  with  him  on  a  handful  of  occasions  since.  The 
Prime Minister has a background in the media and I have always found him to be 
knowledgeable about, and interested in, the way the newspaper industry works and 
is developing. Like his predecessors, he has also always been interested in general 
economic and business discussion. Again I do not recall that he has ever asked me to 
interfere in matters of editorial policy.
Each of the three Prime Ministers I have had dealings with have obviously understood 
from the outset the broad political approach of the newspaper. None has asked me 
to change that approach.’

Richard Desmond

2.21  Mr Desmond has already been discussed in some detail in the Report. In this short section I 

shall focus on his dealings with politicians.

2.22  Mr Desmond presented himself as quintessentially a business man rather than a ‘newspaper 
man’: newspapers are a strictly business, rather than an emotional, undertaking. In his written 
evidence to the Inquiry he explained his approach to editorial freedom and the direction of 
political support of his newspapers:14

‘... all editorial decisions are left to the Editors. The best example I can recall is when 
Peter  Hill  was  the  editor  of  the  Daily  Express,  he  wanted  the  newspaper  to  stop 
supporting the Labour Party and back the Conservative Party. I got on well with Tony 
Blair and I felt bad for letting him down. However, at the end of the day, it was the 
Editor’s decision and the paper trusted his political allegiance [sic]’

2.23  Mr Desmond was asked to amplify on this in his oral evidence. As he explained:15

‘I’m not a – you know, I remember meeting Mr Blair for the first time when we bought 
the papers. He was very nice, we talked about – fortunately, we talked about music 
and drums, which is my passion, and as we walked out of the door, he said to me, 
“Well, who do you support then?” I said, “Pardon?” He said, “Who are you, left, right, 
you know, one of us?” I said “Honestly, mate, I’m not really interested in politics”. 
And he said to me, “You will be”, and interestingly on my way back to the office I got 
hijacked by Porter who said, “What are you? Are you a Tory or a socialist?” I said he 
seems a nice fellow, Blair, so I was a socialist.
Q. We’ve heard from Mr Hill that the paper changed direction, perhaps re-entered its 
natural habitat before 2005.
A. Yes.

1435

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsIQ. Did you have any interest in or influence over that decision?
A. Yeah, I felt that I betrayed Tony, as a mate. I felt he was a good bloke, I thought 
he was doing a good job, I liked him. You know, he came to my house, I went to his 
house or flat or whatever you want to call it. I thought he was a good guy. So I felt on 
a personal level bad, but at the end of the day Peter Hill runs the editorial of the paper 
and that was the decision that he made.
Q. And it’s a decision, therefore, which from my understanding of what you just told 
us that you didn’t oppose. Because you could have overruled it, it could be said?
A. We don’t really work that way.’

Evgeny Lebedev

2.24  Mr Lebedev brought another perspective to the Inquiry through his evidence as joint owner 
with his father of the three Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, although 
his background is obviously different from that of Mr Murdoch on the one hand and Viscount 
Rothermere on the other. He told the Inquiry that he did not set the editorial direction of his 
papers, but left his editors to do so unimpeded. Although he enjoys personal friendships with 
senior politicians such as Boris Johnson,16 and spoke of the symbiotic relationship between 
journalists and politicians, Mr Lebedev was clear that he had never been asked for political 
support from a politician.17 He said that politicians discussed matters of policy with him not in 
order to encourage or secure political support for them but solely so that he as a newspaper 
proprietor had the benefit of a personal explanation.18 However, in answer to a follow-up 
question  Mr  Lebedev  did  impliedly  accept  that  the  distinction  between  the  benefit  of  a 
personal explanation on the one hand and assessing whether a particular policy should be 
supported on the other may be quite a fine one:19

“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So part of the value is that you get a personal explanation 
of why –
A. Yes, exactly, absolutely.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: – a particular idea is good and, although unstated, should 
be supported?
A. Yes, although, as I mentioned before, it will still be left up to the editor of whether 
the policy is supported or not.”

2.25  Mr  Lebedev  sought  to  distance  himself  from  the  type  of  newspaper  proprietor  who  he 
believed might seek to influence policy.20 It is interesting to observe that, from his viewpoint 
as a newspaper proprietor, it was an opinion which he firmly held, no doubt alive to the risks 
which he felt were capable of arising from the complex and shifting dynamic which exists 
between proprietors and politicians: as he put it, ‘because we occupy the same sphere of 
influence’.21

1436

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI2.26  Finally,  Mr  Lebedev  offered  an  interesting  insight,  bearing  in  mind  the  perspective  of  his 

Russian background, into the constitutional importance of a free press:22

“Well,  I  just  think  that  –  okay.  Going  back  to  the  question  of  politicians  meeting 
proprietors, I think we are in danger of building a society where every institution, 
every element of democracy becomes too feeble. So politicians become too feeble, 
police becomes too feeble, the country itself becomes too feeble. If the press also 
becomes feeble, then what we get is what I would call a tyranny of consensus, and 
everyone is afraid or thinks twice or has to check twice before a step they make, a 
comment they make, and I think one of the extraordinary things about this country 
is a very robust and diverse press, and I think that has to be protected. Without, of 
course  –  those  who  have  created  –  who  have  committed  crimes,  sorry,  should  be 
punished and punished according to the law. But I think the robustness of the press in 
this country should be protected because otherwise, as I mentioned earlier, I’ve been 
recently going on trips to countries where there is no freedom of the press. I’ve just 
come back from Ethiopia and there are journalists there that have been charged with 
terrorism, with genocide. Some might be put to death. Countries like that, when you 
visit them and you see what the lack of the freedom of the press has on the effects on 
the government and the state, and also, as far as I’m concerned, I come from – I was 
born in the Soviet Union, I come from Russia, and I can see the effects of not having a 
free press is having on Russia.”

2.27 

Reflections on the proprietors
It  may  be  appropriate  at  this  point  to  make  brief  and  general  observations  about  the 
participation of the proprietors in the work of the Inquiry and indeed in the conclusions and 
recommendations of this Report. It is of the essence of press freedom as discussed in Part B 
of this Report that (consistently with safeguarding the public interest in a plural and diverse 
press) anyone with the means and motivations to do so may own and run a printing press. 
The fact that the proprietors of our national titles can view themselves on a continuum of 
one sort, in the digital age, with the humblest blogger or tweeter does not alter the fact they 
occupy, by virtue of their role, a fundamentally important place in UK public life, and perform 
a vital public service in the contribution they make to a vigorous and thriving democracy.

2.28  As  discussed  below,  although  I  have  reached  the  conclusion  that,  in  some  respects,  the 
relationship between individual newspaper proprietors and senior politicians has not been 
wholly beneficial from the point of view of the public, I do not consider that the principal 
responsibility for remedying that situation lies with the proprietors. The response that I invite 
from newspaper proprietors to this Report lies in a different direction.

2.29  The culture, practices and ethics of individual press organisations, and the contribution that 
each one makes to the culture, practices and ethics of the press viewed as a whole, are matters 
on  which  individual  proprietors  are  uniquely  placed  to  exercise  personal  influence  in  the 
public interest. This does not, in any way, suggest interference with editorial independence or 
with the opinions or content that their titles are free to publish. I am referring instead to the 
way that any important business contributor to national life and culture will want his or her 
business to make that contribution, and to operate in ways that command public respect and 
admiration, enhance the reputation of the business and, in this case, the press generally and 
their titles in particular. The more that the public trust the press, the greater the chance that 
they will partake more freely and to a greater extent in the variety that different titles offer.

22 pp27-28, lines 16-18, ibid

1437

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI2.30 

2.31 

I have noted the support which national newspaper proprietors have expressed for a new 
system of press standards which restores public trust and confidence in, and the reputation 
of,  the  industry  by  offering  an  unequivocal  demonstration  to  the  public  that  the  press  is 
committed to the standards of the best, to eradicating the causes of past failures and to real 
ambition about the way things will be seen to be done in future.23 

I hope, therefore, that in response to this Report and however lively the debate and analysis 
freely playing out in the pages of their titles, newspaper proprietors will continue to play 
an open and public-spirited role in embracing the need for a system of press accountability 
that inspires public confidence. I have no doubt that they are able to set the tone within 
and beyond their organisations and I hope that they will feel able to do so. From the point 
of view of the readership and the wider public, there has perhaps never been such a clear 
need for leadership within the industry both in relation to regulation and issues of internal 
governance.

3.	

‘Too	close’	a	relationship

3.1 

3.2 

3.3 

Generic conclusions
Having tested and examined the proposition that the relationship between politicians and 
the press has become too close, including through the historical and current perspectives 
of our last five Prime Ministers, the thoughts of contemporary politicians, and the series of 
‘case studies’ which have been chosen (or, more precisely, simply presented themselves) to 
exemplify the nature and character of this relationship, it is now appropriate to draw the 
strands together and express some conclusions of a general nature.

In this part of the Report it is the generic nature of these conclusions which is important, not 
the specifics of the relationship between any individual Prime Minister and any individual 
newspaper  proprietor.  I  have  already  set  out  my  conclusions  in  particular  cases,  and  the 
evidence which in my view supports each conclusion, citing chapter and verse in relation to 
witness statements and the transcripts. Almost invariably, I have not relied simply on what 
commentators and other observers have said or opined (although some of these contributions 
have been full of insight); instead, my conclusions have been based on what the proprietors 
and the politicians themselves have told me. 

For the purposes of these high-level conclusions I believe that it is unnecessary to set out 
other than one or two isolated examples of the supporting evidence which is to be found in 
the main body of the Report: indeed, it would be invidious to do so, given that the scale of 
the available evidence would force me to be selective, and it might then be wondered why 
I have cited evidence in relation to one politician but not another. However, my findings do 
have to be reasoned and supported by evidence, and I have decided to place links to all of the 
relevant evidence in Appendix 5 to the Report.

3.4 

I  should  also  explain  that,  pursuant  to  my  obligation  to  act  fairly  under  the  Inquiry  Rules 
2006,  in  particular  Rules  13-15,  I  have  given  the  leaders  of  the  three  main  parties  in  the 
UK24 advance notice of these generic conclusions, which were then at a provisional stage of 

23 Part K, Chapter 7
24 I did not write to the leaders of the national parties of government and opposition in the UK devolved 
administrations in this way because, as I make clear in this Report, in my opinion the conduct of politicians of devolved 
government cannot reasonably be considered as part of the historical UK national pattern with which my generic 
conclusions are concerned

1438

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI3.5 

3.6 

formulation, as well as notice of the supporting evidence. No-one has sought to take issue 
with what I then called my ‘generic criticisms’ which now follow. 

In  my  view,  the  evidence  clearly  demonstrates  that  the  political  parties  of  UK  national 
government and of UK official opposition25 have had or developed too close a relationship 
with the press. This assessment relates to the period of the last thirty to thirty-five years but is 
likely, as has been suggested, to have been much longer than that. Although this relationship 
has fluctuated over time, the evidence suggests there has been a perceptible increase in the 
proximity of the relationship over this period. I do not believe this has been in the public 
interest. I do not seek to attribute or apportion blame any more specifically than that.

The relationship between the press and the politicians has been too close in the following 
principal respects. First, in my view (and as many have said) politicians have spent a surprisingly 
large amount of time, attention and resource on this relationship in comparison to, and at 
the expense of, other legitimate claims in relation to their conduct of public affairs. Second, 
in conducting their relationship with the press, politicians have not always maintained, with 
adequate  rigour,  appropriate  boundaries  between  the  conduct  of  public  affairs  and  their 
private or personal interests. Third, politicians have failed to conduct their relationship with 
the press with sufficient transparency and accountability from the point of view of the public. 
Again, it would be invidious, and unnecessary, for me to be any more specific than this in 
evidencing these conclusions.

3.7 

I therefore conclude that politicians have conducted themselves in a way that I do consider 
has not served the public interest, so as: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

to  place  themselves  in  a  position  in  which  they  risked  becoming  vulnerable  to 
unaccountable influences in a manner which was, at least, potentially in conflict with 
their responsibilities in relation to the conduct of public affairs; 
to miss a number of clear opportunities decisively to address (and persistently fail to 
respond more generally to) public concern about, the culture practices and ethics of 
the press; and 
to seek to control (if not manipulate) the supply of news and information to the public 
in  return  for  expected  or  hoped-for  favourable  treatment  by  sections  of  the  press, 
beyond that which is appropriate or an inevitable by product of politics in a 24-7 media 
age, but to a degree and by means other than the fair and reasonable partisan conduct 
of public debate.

In  making  the  first  and  second  of  these  points  I  should  not  be  interpreted  as  concluding 
that  politicians  have  made  express  or  implied  ‘deals’  with  press  proprietors  in  a  manner 
contrary to the public interest. Rather, I have concluded that a combination of these factors 
has contributed to a lessening of public confidence in the conduct of public affairs, by giving 
rise to legitimate perceptions and concerns that politicians and the press have traded power 
and influence in ways which are contrary to the public interest and out of public sight. These 
perceptions  and  concerns  are  inevitably  particularly  acute  in  relation  to  the  conduct  by 
politicians of public policy issues in relation to the press itself.

3.8 

25 I am, of course, conscious of the limited extent to which the Liberal Democrat party (and its predecessors) have, in 
practice, fitted within that description

1439

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI3.9 

As I have already pointed out, the evidence upon which I rely is available in Appendix 5 to the 
Report. I content myself by citing just one piece of evidence from an experienced politician. 
The Rt Hon Lord Patten of Barnes CH put it this way:26

“I think major political parties, and particularly their leaders over the last 20 or 25 
years, have often demeaned themselves by the extent to which they’ve paid court on 
proprietors and editors. Of course I’m in favour of talking to editors and journalists 
but I’m not in favour of grovelling, and I think that politicians have very often laboured 
under – again, I’m reminded of something I said by the documents you asked me to 
look at. I think that politicians have allowed themselves to be kidded by editors and 
proprietors that editors and proprietors determine the fate of politicians.”

3.10 

In concluding that the relationship has become too close, I bear in mind that this has been 
acknowledged by many of our leading contemporary politicians themselves, but in different 
ways and to different degrees. I also bear in mind and fully recognise that the overwhelming 
majority of close interactions between politicians and the press are not only entirely healthy, 
but an essential part of democratic life. It is important therefore to set out some of the wider 
context to my generic conclusions before turning to thoughts for the future, both to explain 
what I mean by those conclusions, and, just as important, to be clear about the aspects of the 
relationship which I consider to be entirely outside the scope of my criticisms.

3.11 

In doing so, I turn first to two distinct aspects of the problem I have identified, before stepping 
back to consider some wider context.

Image and ‘spin’

3.12  The acknowledgement that relationships have become too close is not just one about public 
perceptions (whatever the reality) that covert deals have or might have been done. To some 
extent the closeness has simply been a matter of politicians spending too much time and 
attention on the press, perhaps worrying too much about the fleeting minutiae of image and 
presentation in a way which is not proportionate to the substance of national politics. To that 
extent, this Report need do little more than amplify the message that this is, in itself, conduct 
which demonstrably undermines public trust and confidence.

3.13 

In  doing so, when  viewing the matter from  their  perspective, it  is  impossible  not  to  have 
considerable sympathy with the politicians. In a context of declining public engagement with 
and confidence in the national political process, the most natural thing in the world is to try 
to improve the situation with attractive and engaging communications strategies, trying to 
harness the power of the media to tell better and brighter narratives, trying to contain the 
power of the media to corrode public opinion or, in other words, simply getting the message 
across more successfully. But it is a strategy which carries within it the very obvious risk of 
being counter-productive. 

3.14  The presentation of politics is vital to a healthy democracy, but the politics of presentation can 
themselves foster cynicism, disengagement and public mistrust. The ubiquity and slickness 
of modern communications is daily life for all of us, and the public is highly sophisticated in 
filtering and interpreting it. Where political content is concerned, people are especially wary 
and sceptical. I make allowance for the degree to which the media themselves may have been 
over-zealous in promoting public distrust of politicians: from one perspective, ‘spin’ is just the 
out-manoeuvring of unfair and corrosive press criticism. Nevertheless, the perception of the 

26 pp8-9, lines 15-13, Lord Patten, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-
Afternoon-Hearing-23-January-2012.pdf

1440

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIpolitician as salesman, to be treated with circumspection by the wise, is an abiding obstacle 
to public trust and confidence.

3.15  This is a lesson which many politicians may already be learning. A number of important steps 
have already been taken in the right direction. These include progress on the approach to 
government communications since the Phillis Report,27 in which Sir Robert Phillis analysed the 
state of public confidence in the relationship between the politicians and the press as it stood 
in 2003. Credit must be given for the measures put in place to secure more straightforward 
communications strategies which the public can better understand. 

3.16 

It is striking too, however, how much of Sir Robert’s advice bears repetition. Of his seven 
key  principles  for  modern  government  communications,  three  in  particular  remain  highly 
relevant today, and relevant to the conduct of all political relationships with the press and 
not merely those of governments. These are, first, the importance of politicians engaging 
in  more  unmediated  communications  with  the  public;  secondly,  staying  on  the  right  side 
of the dividing line between the positive presentation of policies and achievements on the 
one hand and misleading spin on the other; and thirdly, the use of all relevant channels of 
communication rather than excessively emphasising national press and broadcasters.

3.17  Further progress in the direction of a more straightforward relationship between politicians 
and press is likely, in itself, to reap benefits in improved public confidence. That conclusion 
speaks for itself.

3.18 

In a small number of specific respects, however, I have concluded that simply setting out 
the criticisms in writing (as I have done) will not, on its own, be sufficient to secure further 
improvement. I return to this in the recommendations at the end of this Chapter. 

The press as lobbyists

3.19  This  Part  of  the  Report  has  drawn  attention  to  a  number  of  ways  in  which  the  press  has 
exercised  political  influence,  in  other  words  engaged  in  lobbying.  There  have  been  those 
in  positions  of  leadership  of  the  press  who  have  shown  themselves  to  be  exceptionally 
dedicated, powerful and effective political lobbyists in the cause of their own (predominantly 
commercial, but also wider) interests. The fact that lobbying is pursued through the medium 
of personal relationships, and at an intuitive level, is part of its effectiveness. The lobbying 
may be powerful exactly because it need not be crudely articulated.

3.20  Here,  it  is  critical  to  differentiate  lobbying  from  campaigning.  The  press  undertakes  many 
campaigning activities, editorially and otherwise, to excellent effect. These include investigative 
campaigns  and  campaigns  on  matters  which  have  captured  the  public  imagination,  such 
as ‘Help for Heroes’. They include all sorts of campaigns on political issues, including party 
political campaigns and electioneering. All of this is the very stuff of journalism and part of 
the important contribution the press makes to our public life. 

3.21  The press also campaigns on particular subjects on the basis that it represents to governments 
the views of its readers and argues for them. The readership of national titles, however, is 
sometimes more sceptical and diverse in its views than the editorial stance of the title might 
suggest; the sophistication of readers and consumers of media has never been greater. Nor 
can the antennae of editors, however finely tuned and however much apparently validated

learn from their constituents.

3.22 

It may be, as witnesses such as the Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke MP have observed, that press 
campaigning activities in areas such as criminal justice and immigration have, over the years, 
seemed  to  carry  more  weight  in  political  circles  than  they  may  have  strictly  merited  as  a 
matter of the evidence of public opinion or, more importantly still, as a matter of empirical 
evidence and of proportion. But, rightly or wrongly, such campaigning will always be the stuff 
of politics.

3.23  Lobbying,  in  this  context,  is  very  different.  Here  I  refer  to  activities  designed  to  promote 
the self-interest of the press not only to increase readership and sales but more basically 
also as a matter of commercial self-interest. This is not just about their individual titles and 
organisations but also about the media or the press in general, including matters of regulation 
and accountability.

3.24  Of course, as advocates for their own commercial interests, the press are in some respects 
in no different a position from other major commercial organisations or sectors, capable of 
exerting power and influence over public policy and I am well aware that very much broader 
questions about political lobbying do, from time to time, rise up the political agenda. These 
issues cannot be part of this Report.28

3.25  Nor  do  I  consider  any  of  the  ‘self-interested’  lobbying  activities  of  the  press  to  be  an 
appropriate  matter  for  press  regulation.  Media  companies  should  not  be  criticised  for,  or 
restrained  from,  lawfully  advocating  their  private  interests  with  all  the  considerable  skill 
and resource at their command, and at the highest levels to which they can (and do) secure 
access.  The  dedication  and  resourcefulness  of  press  organisations  as  lobbyists  has  been 
vividly illustrated for the Inquiry in the person of Mr Michel.29 There is no doubting the sheer 
hard work and professionalism of press lobbyists and I have no reason to believe that Mr 
Michel is an isolated phenomenon in this respect. 

3.26  There is an important exception to the principle of unrestrained advocacy, and it relates to 
the openness and formality required in the context of quasi-judicial decision-making. This 
exception applies just as much to any other commercial or campaigning organisation as it 
does to the press. 

3.27  Having said that, I am clear that it is, more generally, entirely the responsibility of the politicians 
who are the object of lobbying to judge how far and in what way they consider it to be in the 
public interest for them to respond. As I have said, the relationship is not a symmetrical one. 
The politicians have responsibilities to the public who elected them. Lobbyists do not. 

3.28  One of the chief responsibilities of politicians is to bear in mind that while a free and healthy 
press is certainly in the public interest, that does not mean that everything which is in the 
(commercial or wider) interests of any individual press organisation, or even of the industry 
as a whole, will itself necessarily be in the public interest. The matter must be looked at in the 
round, taking all relevant considerations into account. I make that clear because, in listening 
to the evidence, I have noted the way in which the rhetoric of public interest tends to become 
elided with the self-interest of the press. No doubt other sectors also routinely appeal to 

28 I appreciate that other lobbyists might have other potential tools of persuasion in their possession; the megaphone 
(which is the tool available to the press), however, is undeniably extremely powerful and, therefore, justifies 
consideration in its own right

1442

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIa sense of the public interest in the health of their enterprises and the contribution they 
make to general quality of life, prosperity and well being. Perhaps the press do so especially 
insistently. It is politicians’ job to test such claims on a case by case basis.

3.29  Furthermore, there are particular temptations and vulnerabilities for politicians in connection 
with  lobbying  from  the  press.  First,  the  press  hold  the  powerful  weapons  of  a  public 
megaphone and extensive, behind the scenes access. Second, there is the direct influence 
that the press exercises over public communications about the relationship itself. This has a 
personal dimension which can be and has been very striking.

The personal dimension

3.30  Free  communication  at  a  personal  level  between  press  and  politicians  is  vital  for  healthy 
democracy. It is how the public is kept informed, both of the detail of current affairs and of 
the large scale issues of politics, policy and citizenship. It fosters public engagement in the 
debated issues of the day, civic responsibility, responsive government and allows power to 
be held to account in the public interest. Face to face communication can be among the most 
powerful and effective, and is therefore of very real importance.

3.31  At  the  same  time,  as  politicians  and  journalists  are  constantly  thrown  together  or  seek 
each other out, often in informal or social contexts, personal relationships can develop into 
friendship; that is, of course, often the case when people share time, professional interests 
and backgrounds. 

3.32 

In this context, the relationship between national politicians and the national print press has 
some distinctive qualities of its own. Whereas the broadcast media are subject to constraints 
of  political  neutrality,  balance  and  impartiality,  the  free  partisanship  of  newspapers  is,  by 
contrast, of their essence. They foster a form of political debate which is noisy, polemical and 
critical, and which is rightly highly valued as part of the UK’s heritage. They offer a choice of 
different world views and different values, among which readers can make their choice, and 
the variety of which promotes richness of perspective and public debate. What the national 
press uniquely offers the politician, therefore, is attractively packaged, and actively mediated, 
political partisanship. 

3.33  That in turn means that political/press relationships tend to have a focused bilateral quality, 
in  which  each  party  has  something  the  other  wants.  This  motivates  politicians  to  get  a 
quantifiable  outcome  from  their  investment  in  relationships  with  journalists.  It  may  be  in 
terms  of  new  information,  political  and  policy  support,  or  the  enhancement  of  personal 
reputation and profile. It also motivates the press, perhaps to try for exclusive access, or for 
something else tangible.

3.34  This distinctive relationship is full of vigour, and a life-force which gives it the capacity to evolve 
in response to changing times. It is visibly still evolving and changing today, largely as a result 
of the proliferation of new media. That gives politicians new opportunities to communicate 
with the public in alternative, and highly personal ways; some politicians have emerged as 
gifted  bloggers  with  attentive  and  enthusiastic  readerships,  others  have  made  the  use  of 
Twitter  very  much  their  own.  These  constitute  new,  lively  fora  of  political  debate  in  their 
own right, very accessible to the public, directly participative in real time, and more raucous, 
opinionated and diverse than ever. All of this is full of potential to benefit our national life in 
the digital age.

1443

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI3.35  However, these changes have also brought new pressures into political/press relationships. 
The online 24 hour presence of newspapers and other news sources has the consequence 
that both press and politicians now have substantially less control over information, and face 
more competition for attention.

3.36  These changes inevitably affect the dynamic of the relationship between the politicians and 
the press. The print press is no longer the unique medium through which public reputation 
and  political  partisanship  is  contested  and  is  no  longer  the  all-surrounding  sea  in  which 
political fish must swim or sink. But paradoxically, this may enhance the relative power of 
what remains unique about the press: a powerful, mediated partisanship which may indeed 
contain unspoken expectations of a tangible return. 

3.37  There are other kinds of pressure. The Inquiry received evidence about the extent to which 
politicians may legitimately be regarded as having relatively limited expectations of personal 
privacy, by virtue of their publicly accountable role, or because they have taken particular 
public positions (for example on moral issues). This is not straightforward. In law, a politician 
has like any other citizen a right to respect for his or her privacy, autonomy and family life. But 
that is a right which can be ‘waived’ to a greater or lesser degree, or, perhaps more accurately 
if less technically, ‘traded’. The press could be described as a ‘trading floor’ in the extent to 
which personal information is publicised, so the issue of express or implied waiver of privacy 
is always potentially in issue in interactions with the press.30

3.38  Politicians may choose to concede a measure of privacy to journalists for a range of reasons; 
these might be to put themselves in a good light, to offer an exclusive, or simply to maintain 
a  good  or  important  working  relationship.  The  terms  of  this  trade  are,  however,  hard  to 
articulate, vary from person to person, and are constantly under negotiation. They are largely 
untestable too, since not bringing the issue to the test (particularly not via the law) is integral 
to the maintenance of the interaction. For politicians, managing their relationships with the 
press is, in day to day reality, a matter of endless variation on the themes of personality, 
power and vulnerability. The civil law (of privacy and defamation) remains in position as a 
long stop in cases of relationship breakdown. But there are few other rules. 

3.39 

I  was  also  struck  by  what  Mr  Coulson  said  in  his  evidence31  about  the  inexorable  growth 
of  the  importance  of  individual  personality  at  the  highest  level  (indeed  at  all  levels)  in 
politics. Mr Coulson spoke of the significant investment needed to ensure that the public 
has an “authentic view” of senior politicians. That can involve a work of portraiture in which 
colour and background are provided by well-chosen and sympathetic insights into aspects of 
character, and private and family life. It is easy to see that the potential dividend of bringing 
the  human  side  to  the  fore  is  an  attractive  one;  but  as  some  of  the  Inquiry’s  ‘celebrity’ 
witnesses observed, it brings with it a large and obvious risk. If an image is explicitly presented 
as ‘authentic’, does that not to some degree invite a challenge to the claim of authenticity, 
and legitimise intrusion into other aspects of character, privacy and family life? 

3.40 

I mention these issues because of the light they shed on how, when the press operate as 
lobbyists within those personal relationships, issues of particular concern can arise.

30 Exactly the same has been vigorously argued by the press in relation to certain celebrities

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIPublic interest issues

3.41  The relationships within which lobbying can take place are not the everyday relationships 
of journalism and politics. They are the relationships of policy makers (actual or potential) 
and  those  who  stand  to  benefit  directly  from  those  policies.  That  is  a  limited  category, 
comprising (on the one hand) a small number of relevant Government decision-makers and 
those who credibly aspire to those positions in the future, and (on the other) the proprietors 
and executive decision-makers of the press. Nevertheless this limited category of personal 
relationships  partakes  fully  of  the  personal  qualities  of  all  press/political  relationships  as 
described above; those qualities may also include real friendship. 

3.42 

In  press/political  relationships  within  this  limited  category,  the  boundaries  between 
government, party and private business in relation to a politician’s dealings with the press 
are particularly fluid and blurred, and inevitably so, for all the reasons set out above. Any 
individual  interaction  is  likely  to  contain  elements  of  all  three.  Government  profile  and 
party political profile are virtually inseparable at the level of individual interactions, and the 
personal dimension pervades the whole. 

3.43  Movement  across  these  boundaries,  although  inevitable,  can  cause  problems  because 
existing formal mechanisms of public accountability applying to these relationships depend 
on them. Where press/political relationships are concerned, there appear to be few ‘bright 
lines’  in  practice  between  the  conduct  of  government  business  with  its  formalities  and 
accountabilities on the one hand, and informal ‘political’ or ‘personal’ interactions on the 
other; the personal reputation and public profile of the politician will always be a concern at 
some level in all these interactions. The theoretically separate domains are in fact inseparable 
and it is this which gives rise to the problems of public perception when press lobbying takes 
place. The impression is given of decisions being taken about matters of media policy in the 
context of close, personal relationships (and friendships); there is then a legitimate concern 
that the public will be in the dark on matters of legitimate interest to them and accountability 
will be lost. The narrative of the BSkyB bid is relevant in this respect.

3.44  That risk also includes the possibility that the public will not be completely in the dark, but 
may come to learn something of what appear to be close relationships and reasonably suspect 
them of being in some degree relevant to the conduct of public affairs. Save for speculation 
or intrusion, however, there is no available means of understanding how far that may be so. 
That leaves the matter unsatisfactory from the public point of view; further, the speculation 
exposes the politicians involved to a degree of innuendo along with the difficulty of proving 
a negative both of which could very well be unfair. 

3.45  The result is uncomfortable and creates a problem for all concerned: the public is entitled 
to know about a personal relationship if, but only if, it is relevant to the conduct of public 
responsibilities for which a politician should fairly be accountable. By their nature, the very 
senior  relationships  I  am  considering  do  contain  the  clear  potential  to  have  that  sort  of 
relevance. In the circumstances, it seems to me that it is necessary to find a way between the 
bare assertion of irrelevance to the conduct of public affairs on the one hand, and intolerable 
eavesdropping on private lives, on the other. I reflect on this further below. 

3.46 

In the rough and tumble of political life, pressures within the personal relationships between 
the  decision-makers  in  the  press  and  in  politics  have  always  been  there.  But  there  is  an 
argument for saying that they appear to be intensifying in ways which are associated with a 
ripple of public unease. This can be described in a number of ways, but the common theme 
is the perception of the impoverishment of public debate and of risk to the public interest. 

1445

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI3.47  The focus of the press and the politicians on managing the individual relationship between 
themselves at all levels has, it is said, begun to show an increased tendency to focus on what 
each stands to gain in a narrow, self-interested way, to the exclusion, and at the expense, of 
the wider public, and the public interest both in journalism and in politics. As I have already 
observed, some evidence of this is apparent in the low and declining levels of public trust 
in both press and politicians, in public disengagement from the processes of politics, in the 
criticism  of  ‘spin’  and  PR  techniques,  and  of  the  infusion  of  celebrity  values  into  political 
behaviour and journalism.

3.48 

In these relationships, there is what I have described as an inevitable ‘trading’ element. The 
politicians have exclusive news and exclusive relationships, private advocacies and personal 
titbits to offer; and, in return, the press has partisanship, personal favours, the protection 
of sources and not holding to account. Potential promises and threats hang in the air. It all 
means, in short, that politicians have a particular susceptibility to being lobbied when they 
get close to the opinion-makers of the press. 

3.49  The public, in turn, stand to be the losers. They have a reason to worry that public debate may 
be being manipulated behind their backs, public policy decided unaccountably, and the ethics 
of both press and politicians compromised in the process. It was the concern of this Module 
of the Inquiry to reflect on the nature and proportions of that risk, and my conclusions are 
set out above.

3.50  The conclusions that I have reached are troubling but this should not be surprising. In July 
2011, the Prime Minister stated that, in his view, the relationship between politicians and the 
press needed to be re-set, and I entirely agree. Some progress has been made since then, and 
I welcome the fact that the leaders of the three main national parties in this country have 
not sought to challenge the proposition  that my overall conclusions  are justifiable on the 
evidence or to persuade me of an alternative view. But this acknowledgement is only the first 
step on the road, not the last.

3.51  The Report has concluded that over not just the last thirty to thirty-five years, but really over 
two generations, there have been failures to act politically on previous warnings about media 
misconduct.  These  failures  can  be  associated  with  indications  that,  over  recent  decades, 
the press and the politicians have formed too close a relationship, and that that has in turn 
damaged  public  confidence  in  the  political  process.  The  Terms  of  Reference  require  me 
explicitly to address this issue, and expressed in these terms, it needs to be recognised that 
politicians have over the years been ‘part of the problem’ of press standards. 

3.52 

It is clear, however, that politicians hold the complete solution. The relationship between the 
press and the politicians needs, this time, to make a distinctive break with that history, and 
change in such a way that is visible to the public. 

4.	 Existing	regulatory	framework
4.1 

As  noted  above,  there  are  very  few  constraints  beyond  the  legal  basics  governing  the 
relationship between the press and politicians  and no case can be made for the ordinary 
run  of  interactions  between  journalists  and  politicians  to  be  anything  other  than  freely 
negotiated  and  managed  by  the  parties  involved,  without  interference.  The  existing 
‘regulatory framework’ is, therefore, limited to and rightly focused on only the very specific 
circumstances where there are pressing reasons of public interest to be safeguarded.

1446

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.2 

All members of Parliament are required, for example, to comply with the Houses’ rules on the 
registrable declaration of interests, the purpose of which is:32

4.3 

4.4 

4.5 

4.6 

4.7 

4.8 

“to provide information on any financial or non-financial benefit received by a MP 
or Member of the Lords which might reasonably be thought by others to influence 
their actions, speeches or votes in Parliament or influence their actions taken in their 
capacity as a Member.”

This important discipline, which is obviously not confined to interests in relation to the press, 
is imposed in the interests of transparency, not to inhibit the holding of interests as such but 
to ensure that the public is aware of them and able to take them into account in forming a 
view  on  politicians’  conduct  of  Parliamentary  business.  Similar  rules  apply  to  the  specific 
articulation of interests in the course of contributing to Parliamentary debates.

The liberty of Parliamentarians to speak and act freely in Parliament is a cornerstone of our 
constitutional democracy, protected for hundreds of years by the Bill of Rights and regularly 
reaffirmed  by  both  Parliament  itself  and  the  courts  when  the  matter  is  challenged.  The 
transparency of Members’ interests is in no sense incompatible with that freedom. On the 
contrary, it is designed to promote it, by ensuring that the conduct of Parliamentarians ought 
not to be casually impugned by reference to allegations of hidden interests, and by allowing 
Members  to  be  mindful  of  any  appearance  of  conflict  between  private  interests  and  the 
public interest, and to deal with any such appearance openly and explicitly as and when it 
may be relevant to the conduct of public affairs.

It  is  a  discipline  whose  focus  is  on  tangible,  material  benefits  to  the  politician,  whether 
pecuniary or in kind, rather than on the subtleties of the exchanges of advantage (including 
reputational  advantage)  which  characterise  press/political  relationships.  Although  it  can, 
and does, for example tell the public when a politician is being paid to write articles for a 
newspaper, or when he or she holds a position on the board of a media organisation, it is not 
intended to go very much further than that in telling the public about the relationship.

The principal context in which there is a regulatory dimension of any sort to the relationship 
between the press and the politicians, therefore, is of restricted application to politicians who 
are members of Government. It is obvious why that should be so. Government politicians are 
in a unique relationship of power and accountability in the conduct of public business, to the 
electorate. They are decision-takers. That is underpinned both in law and in practice.

As a matter of law, there are a number of disciplines which are capable of imposing constraints, 
almost entirely of transparency, on the relationship between Government Ministers and the 
press. The Freedom of Information Act, for example, will oblige the disclosure of information 
about  that  relationship  to  the  public  on  demand,  subject  only  to  exemptions  imposed  to 
protect countervailing aspects of the public interests. Its application is, however, limited to 
recorded information, and to information held by or on behalf of government (rather than 
information held by Ministers in a party or personal capacity).

Government accounting rules apply disciplines and transparency measures to government 
spending on issues relating to the press, as they do to all government spending. And the 
ordinary requirements of public law in relation to decision-making in government, including 
on matters such as public consultation, the giving of reasons for decisions, and the availability 
of judicial review, will also where appropriate apply to matters and interactions relating to 
the press.

1447

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI4.9 

Other, less legally-based, disciplines will also apply but very specifically only to the conduct of 
government business relating to the press, principal among which is the Ministerial Code.33 
As former Cabinet Secretary Lord O’Donnell explained to the Inquiry:34

“The  Code  sets  out,  in  a  public  document,  the  standards  of  conduct  expected  of 
Ministers  and  the  lines  of  accountability.  There  are  high  standards  of  conduct 
expected  of  Ministers  and  rightly  so  because  they  are  decision  takers  and  it  is 
therefore  important  that  their  decisions  and  actions  are  beyond  reproach.  Recent 
improvements by this Government enabling greater transparency around meetings 
and hospitality are also to be welcomed. I believe this transparency about standards 
of conduct increases and helps ensure accountability.
The aspects which I believe to be relevant to the conduct of relationships between 
the media and Ministers are accountability, collective responsibility, openness and 
the need to avoid any conflict of interests, including ensuring that decisions are taken 
on the merits of the case and that no improper influence is brought to bear. These 
provisions operate on a daily basis through the relationship between Ministers and 
their Permanent Secretaries. I believe the Code is stringent and provides for a high 
bar. A recent addition in July 2011 which provides for the publication of information 
about Ministers’ meetings with senior media executives shows how the Code is an 
evolving document able to react to developments as they arise.”

4.10 

In his oral evidence to the Inquiry, Lord O’Donnell also explained that the Ministerial Code is 
principles-based35 and intended to address not just conflicts of interest but also the perception 
of conflict.36 The amendment of July 2011, made with the support of the Prime Minister at 
the same time as the Inquiry was set up, provides that:37

“The  Government  will  be  open  about  its  links  with  the  media.  All  meetings  with 
newspaper  and  other  media  proprietors,  editors  and  senior  executives  will  be 
published quarterly regardless of the purpose of the meeting.”

4.11  Lord O’Donnell explained that this insertion was made to avoid any possible doubt that the 
requirements of paragraph 8.14 of the Ministerial Code applied to meetings with senior press 
figures:

“Ministers meet many people and organisations and consider a wide range of views 
as part of the formulation of Government policy. Departments will publish, at least 
quarterly, details of Ministers’ external meetings.”

Self-evidently now, this covers a whole range of lobbying activity and is apt to cover meetings 
with the press.38

4.12  On  the  face  of  it,  these  words  are  extremely  wide  and,  to  repeat  the  words,  appear  to 
cover every meeting “regardless of purpose”. However, it is also important to understand 
the limitations of the Ministerial Code. First, it obviously has no application to Opposition 
politicians  who  are  not,  by  definition,  present  decision-takers,  although  they  may  very

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIwell  be  engaging  in  interactions,  particularly  as  general  elections  draw  near,  with  a  view 
to  establishing  relationships  and  preparing  for  decision-taking  should  they  be  offered  the 
opportunity of power by the electorate. Second, it does not apply to politicians of governing 
parties who do not hold government positions; again, they are not by definition decision-
takers, although they may hope for preferment, not least by establishing useful relationships 
or otherwise acting on behalf of, or with a view to attracting the approval of, government 
ministers. Third and of critical significance, it addresses only Ministerial activities that are 
classified as government business, excluding therefore activities classifiable as either party or 
private business.

4.13 

The gaps in the existing framework
In a nutshell, it is because of the potential overlap between the way business can be classified 
as government, party or private that the relationships between the press and politicians can 
create  problems  in  the  context  of  the  lobbying  activities  of  the  press.  The  general  public 
interest considerations underlying the transparency requirements of the Code are being only 
partially served by what is presently required.

4.14  As  I  have  said,  those  general  public  interest  considerations  do  not  necessarily  lie  in  the 
suppression or discouragement of lobbying relationships. They lie in the transparency of those 
relationships and the enhanced accountability which follows from that transparency. Just as 
in the case of Parliamentary disclosure of interests, good democratic governance requires 
that the interests and influences to which Ministers are subject should not necessarily be 
subject to restriction as such, but should be known about and understood, so that judgments 
can be made about their decisions and the decisions will be taken in the knowledge that 
those judgments will be made.

4.15  Put at its crudest, the problem of the incomplete fit between the public interest considerations 
underlying the Ministerial Code and the realities of political/press relationships, raises a form 
of what might be described as anti-avoidance issues. If it is too easy for a Minister to classify 
an  encounter  with  the  press  as  ‘political’  or  ‘personal’  business  rather  than  ‘government’ 
business, the formal checks and balances on propriety and accountability in decision-taking 
become too  marginal  to  do  proper service. Furthermore, that threefold  classification  into 
government,  party  and  personal  relationships  may  be  more  theoretical  than  real  where 
relationships  with  the  press  are  concerned;  such  relationships  are  characteristically  more 
complex  and  fluid  than  that.  Again,  from  the  same  perspective,  if  a  Minister  and  a  press 
proprietor or executive arrange to conduct aspects of their relationship via intermediaries, 
then a transparency provision biting only on the Minister’s own behaviour will have little real 
force. 

4.16  Put slightly differently, and allowing for the observation of the spirit as well as the letter of 
the Ministerial Code, the problem is one of partial transparency which potentially distorts 
the public perspective on the relationship. In turn, that potentially does damage to the public 
accountability which the Code is intended to serve. If the public is told that a politician has a 
single meeting with a press interest on ‘government’ business, but knows nothing about the 
weekly or daily interactions on ‘political’ or ‘personal’ business, to a potentially significant 
degree, the public is being misinformed in a matter in which it has a legitimate interest. As I 
have said, the three are not so easily separable in practice.

1449

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI4.17  And, just as important, in this situation, there is a very powerful incentive and momentum 
precisely for the lobbyists of the press to guide their political relationships into the private 
sphere of friendships, and to cultivate the private dimensions of the political friendships they 
already  have.  That  need  not  be  a  cynical  process,  but  may  simply  be  intuitive.  I  have  no 
reason to doubt that the appetite for and gift of political friendships of people like Rebekah 
Brooks and Rupert Murdoch was (and was almost certainly experienced as) wholly authentic. 
But such friendships not only intensify the influence of the lobbyist, they pull the relationship 
(including its lobbying dimension) out of the sphere of accountability. The closer, the more 
intense, the relationship, the lesser the public accountability.

4.18  The  evidence  the  Inquiry  received  about  this  hinterland  of  press/political  interaction  at 
the level of personal friendships was one of the particularly cogent features of this Module 
of  the  Inquiry  in  the  public  mind.  I  readily  recognise  that  this  interest  had  its  trivial  and, 
indeed, intrusive dimension: this, in itself, is a problem. I have repeatedly emphasised that 
there  are  and  must  remain  limits  on  the  legitimate  public  interest  in  knowing  the  details 
about politicians’ private lives and genuine friendships. But the public interest in knowing 
something of the fact and degree of such friendships, where they overlap with extremely 
powerful lobbying interests, is another matter. In that, it is my view that the Inquiry performed 
a legitimate public service, and it is in this area that I consider that a way forward needs to 
be found.

4.19 

It is important, however, to be very clear indeed about the limited nature of the problem I 
see here. I hope that I have already put beyond doubt that I emphatically do not see any case 
at all for interference in the day to day business of the interaction between journalist and 
politician. Political journalism as a genre has a more powerful claim than many others to be at 
the heart of those essential functions the press performs in a democracy, keeping the public 
informed, holding power to account, and providing a vibrant forum for vigorous debate on 
matters of public life. This is turn requires free-flowing interaction between politicians and 
the press.

4.20  The issue is not one about political journalism, nor indeed about journalism of any sort. It 
is about the relationship between the press and politicians, complex and multi-faceted as it 
is, as the arena within which decisions about public policy relating to the media are lobbied 
about and, ultimately, taken.

4.21  The essence of the problem disclosed by the evidence to the Inquiry is not just that politicians 
may have simply spent too much time and effort on the press, to the detriment of other 
claims on their attention to the conduct of public affairs. It is that, although it has not been 
their intention, politicians have risked actual or potential conflict of interest (via both fear 
and favour) and have done so in dealing with sources of influence which are, in themselves, 
powerful and unaccountable. 

4.22  The  perception  that  politicians  have  done  this  out  of  public  sight  has  diminished  public 
scrutiny and accountability and run the risk of eroding public trust as the full facts emerge. 
In this way, a view gains ground that power and influence have been traded in ways which 
are contrary to the public interest, most especially in relation to media policy issues. The 
principal example of that relates to the long history of missed opportunities to address public 
concerns about press standards.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.	 Recommendations	for	future	relations	between	

politicians	and	the	press

5.1 

5.2 

The starting point
I should perhaps begin this section by being as clear as possible, again, about the matters I 
have no intention of affecting by means of my recommendations in this Part of the Report. 
First, nothing I suggest is intended to intrude into or impact on the private lives and private 
relationships of either of politicians or press figures. Second, I have no intention of affecting 
political journalism as I have already defined it. 

This is a problem about public policy making, about the political approach to media policy and 
press standards in particular and concerns the relationship between politicians and the policy-
makers and decision-takers of the media, that is to say with proprietors, senior executives 
and editors. This is the only area which, to my mind, can cause real concern, not least because 
of the power of their ability to lobby and use that ability (along with an extremely effective 
megaphone) to serve their own interests. 

5.3 

In taking a different approach to these relationships I entirely endorse the analysis of Lord 
O’Donnell in these terms:39

““[T]here will be conversations and  meetings  with  individual  journalists which  are 
the basic lifeblood of politicians and the media interacting. If you see in the House of 
Commons, there are many media representatives there and Ministers, they interact, 
they talk, they phone each other. So … I’m putting the bar at the editors and news 
proprietors above.”
….
“I’ve taken the view that we should define the line at fairly senior proprietors and 
senior editors. I think they are different because of the ability of newspapers to very 
strongly support particular political parties. So I think there is something to be said 
for those things being noted in a transparent way, but they shouldn’t be stopped.”

5.4 

5.5 

The core of the problem is the accountability of politicians, not the conduct of the press. 
This is not simply a matter of significance in its own right. It plays into the wider concern 
about the role and responsibilities of politicians in (or aspiring to) decision-making positions 
in Government and the problems of public perception which these have generated. 

Transparency
To  the  extent  that  the  Inquiry  has  gone  any  way  towards  affecting  the  approach  to  the 
relationship between senior politicians and the press, it has done so by shining an intense but 
temporary light on the issue. Transparency, in this sense, provides both an opportunity for the 
public to understand and assess along with a discipline which is likely to touch on the conduct 
of those involved. However, longer term, there is not enough in the current transparency 
provisions  although  these  are  themselves  designed  to  underpin  public  confidence.  There 
needs to be a workable and proportionate middle way for the future.

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI5.6 

5.7 

In the circumstances, I have concluded that it is appropriate to offer some detailed thoughts 
on possible improvements. The fact is that the relationship between politicians and the press 
has incentives on both sides which could serve to encourage a lack of openness so that a 
simple and generalised appeal to transparency is unlikely either to be self-fulfilling or, more 
widely, to command public confidence. 

That is particularly so in the area of media policy which is the principal subject-matter of 
this Report, namely press standards themselves. This is an area in which press lobbying can 
be particularly powerful by virtue of being concerted. It is illuminating to note the limited 
extent to which the press hold power to account when that power resides in the influence 
wielded by the organisations of the press themselves, even in the case of competitors (to 
which generalisation, there are obvious, honourable, exceptions). It is an area in which I have 
no doubt that the press have acted and will continue to act as powerful lobbyists and yet one 
in which (by admission) the politicians have repeatedly failed to respond to public concerns 
as one series of problems follows another: this is notwithstanding the bewildering number 
of  inquiries  that  have  been  conducted.  It  should  not  be  surprising,  therefore,  that  I  have 
concluded that further steps do need to be taken to address public concerns together with 
the realities of, and perceptions surrounding, the relationships which have given rise to them.

5.8 

Before  discussing  how  it  might  be  possible  to  increase  the  visibility  of  the  way  in  which 
politicians and the press interact at the highest levels of policy formulation, it is necessary to 
recognise that transparency, on its own, has its limits. There are three which I bear particularly 
in mind in making the recommendations I do. 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

There  are  very  proper  limits  on  the  extent  to  which  public  intrusion  into  matters 
genuinely private is tolerable or appropriate. The detail of truly private friendships and 
relationships between politicians (however much they may have invited or permitted 
intrusion into their privacy) and individuals within the press merits respect.
There is a danger of the perverse incentive, well recognised in the context of regimes 
such as that established by the Freedom of Information Act. This danger is that measures 
to increase transparency simply drive activity into a different place. The result is that 
incentives are to be found for avoidance measures (such as ignoring the need to keep 
some  record  or  finding  alternative  ways  to  communicate)  which  serve  only  to  put 
accountability ever more distantly out of reach.
There is also a risk of a different effect. Excessively burdensome rules about transparency 
are  impractical;  mistakes  and  omissions  then  become  virtually  inevitable  and,  in 
themselves, produce unwarranted critique and suspicion. Ultimately, this is all counter-
productive and erodes trust.

5.9 

Towards more transparent relationships
I believe that further steps in the direction of transparency are necessary in order to reassure 
the public and restore confidence in the way the politicians handle those relationships with 
the media in which lobbying is a real possibility. Without seeking to be prescriptive as to what 
should be said, therefore:

I	recommend	as	a	first	step	that	political	leaders	reflect	constructively	on	the	merits	
of	 publishing	 on	 behalf	 of	 their	 party	 a	 statement	 setting	 out,	 for	 the	 public,	 an	
explanation	 of	 the	 approach	 they	 propose	 to	 take	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 party	 policy	 in	
conducting	relationships	with	the	press.	

1452

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.10  The first value of such a public exposition is that it would be a recognition of the potential 
pitfalls of the relationship, a statement of intention to promote a more transparent approach, 
and an explanation of how the public could expect to benefit as a result. That itself would 
help to address issues of public confidence. Clearly setting out the rules they proposed to 
apply to themselves, and by which they expected to be judged, would be both open and 
demonstrably accountable: no doubt political journalism could be expected to play its part in 
assessing the approach and, thus, holding political power to account.

5.11 

In recommending to political leaders how they might best go about that task, I cannot improve 
on  the  evident  animating  spirit  and  exhortation  of  renewal  contained  in  the  Foreword  of 
the Prime Minister to the most recent edition of the Ministerial Code,40 published when the 
current Coalition Government took office following the 2010 General Election:

“Our new government has a particular and historic responsibility: to rebuild confidence 
in our political system. After the scandals of recent years, people have lost faith in 
politics and politicians. It is our duty to restore their trust. It is not enough simply to 
make a difference. We must be different.
“We have promised the people a coalition government united behind the key principles 
of freedom, fairness and responsibility. Every day of this government we must make 
good on that promise, acting in a way that reflects these principles.
“In everything we do – the policies we develop and how we implement them, the 
speeches we give, the meetings we hold – we must remember that we are not masters 
but servants. Though the British people have been disappointed in their politicians, 
they still expect the highest standards of conduct. We must not let them down.
“We must be different in how we think and how we behave. We must be different 
from  what  has  gone  before  us.  Careful  with  public  money.  Transparent  about 
what  we  do  and  how  we  do  it.  Determined  to  act  in  the  national  interest,  above 
improper influence. Mindful of our duty. Above all, grateful for our chance to change 
our country.”

5.12  Remaining with the spirit of the Ministerial Code as a starting point, it is worth considering 
the possibility that there should be greater Ministerial transparency beyond its current scope. 
The Code itself prescribes the approach that should be adopted by Ministers to many if not all 
aspects of their ministerial duties relying on the clarity of the boundary between what may 
be described as political or private activities on the one hand and the conduct of government 
business on the other. However, there is a real risk that the two become blurred in the context 
of influential media relationships and that the latter will be transacted within the space left 
for the former; that risk should not be overlooked.

5.13  The amendment last year to the Ministerial Code recognised the nature of the problem but 
it remains. The Inquiry has revealed that the way in which some of these relationships have 
just been too complex for the Ministerial Code to render what is happening fairly transparent 
to the public in even the most basic way: whether or not lobbying of Ministers on matters 
of public policy takes place in what is ‘party’ or ‘private’ time, there is likely to be a public 
perception that it is. 

5.14  This is not satisfactory especially where the public interest in a free and responsible press is 
concerned and I have little doubt that what has been revealed in the course of the Inquiry 
has  changed  public  perceptions  and  expectations  in  this  respect:  the  challenge  is  now  to 

40 http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/ministerial-code-may-2010.pdf

1453

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsImeet those expectations in a way that both respects where the boundaries should lie and 
is workable. 

5.15 

In  the  light  of  the  limitations  to  the  Ministerial  Code,  I  conclude  that  senior  politicians 
should  now  give  very  serious  consideration  to  accepting  the  case  for  public  transparency 
at least to some degree beyond interactions which may be narrowly categorised as entirely 
on ‘government’ business in order to give a more rounded picture. That does require the 
contemplation of transparency measures in relation to conduct in what might be capable of 
being described as the political or private activities of politicians, but which, for reasons I have 
described above, I consider to be in practice inseparable from their conduct of public business. 

5.16  As I explain below, I have only very limited steps in mind. I am also aware that the concerns that 
I have expressed about, for example, the use of ‘private’ means of communication (personal 
phones, texts and so on) for transacting government business may require a broader look 
at the issues than is open to me and, furthermore, that there could be wider implications 
to that which I suggest. I venture into this area because I believe that the concerns about 
the relationship between politicians and the press which have been ventilated in the Inquiry 
do justify a proportionate and appropriate response. In the circumstances, in encouraging 
politicians of all parties to consider the problem, I set out steps that could be taken in this 
direction simply as a starting point to their deliberations. Having said that, I remain of the view 
that there are problems in this area which are of special relevance to the relations between 
politicians and the press. I believe that these aspects can fairly be dealt with without being 
made to wait for any broader review. 

5.17  First, I have come to the very clear conclusion that transparency must be improved not just 
in relation to interactions taking place directly between senior politicians and proprietors, 
newspaper  editors  and  senior  executives,  but  also  where  they  take  place  between  their 
respective agents, such as junior political colleagues, SpAds and civil servants on the political 
side, and representatives and professional lobbyists on the press side. As I have said, while 
the focus must be firmly on the policy-makers and decision-takers, and while it is important 
to  leave  plenty  of  unrestricted  space  for  the  ordinary  transactions  of  political  journalism, 
the public would be entitled to be sceptical if measures designed to increase transparency 
were circumvented by the use of third-party agents or ‘back channels’. Needless to say, these 
measures should apply to such third party agents only where they are acting in that capacity, 
that is to say on behalf of their principals in matters of policy.

5.18  Second,  I  also  conclude  that  it  would  be  in  the  public  interest  for  obligations  of  greater 
transparency to be undertaken not only by Ministers in Government but also by the Leader and 
Front Bench of the Official Opposition (and, as in the recent past, the Leader and Front Bench 
of a major third party). In this I am conscious of stepping into an area of public life, outside 
the propriety and transparency constraints of the conduct of elections and of Parliamentary 
and Government business, in which public accountability is an underdeveloped concept, but 
it seems right to do so.

5.19 

I say that in the first place because in answer to a general question on the comparison between 
Government and Opposition, the current Leader of the Opposition has accepted that, broadly 
speaking, similar standards should apply.41 Not the least reason for this entirely appropriate 
stance is that the lobbying activities of the press in relation to politicians should not, in my 
view, be undertaken on anything other than a level playing field in terms of party politics.

Afternoon-Hearing-12-June-2012.pdf

1454

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.20 

In  any  event,  there  is  another,  substantive  reason.  This  relates  to  the  public  interest  in 
understanding not only the press influences on the exercise of executive power, but also the 
influences on the aspirants to executive power. The lobbying relationship between the press 
and the politicians is not short term with the impact of general elections being only one part 
of the continuum. The Report has noted the issues that arise for the conduct of the political/
press relationship in the transition from Opposition to Government status, particularly after 
lengthy periods of Opposition and, as Alastair Campbell recognised, there is a risk that habits 
formed in Opposition will remain entrenched in Government in a way that is not, ultimately, 
conducive to the public interest.42

5.21 

In  these  circumstances  I  have  further  concluded  that  public  interest  considerations  of 
transparency apply also in respect of opposition parties who may aspire to, or find themselves 
in a position of, holding a balance of executive power if not exercising it outright. This conclusion 
only serves to underline the critical requirement of a cross party approach to these issues 
while they are at the forefront of public attention. Lord O’Donnell put it this way:43

“I think there’s an opportunity, a window of opportunity to get the opposition parties 
together and say to them: can there be a set of guidelines, code of conduct, something, 
which would cover these relationships which all could sign up to?”

My recommendation is that this opportunity be taken. My starting point, as I have explained, 
would be parity of application for both Government and Opposition, but if there are genuine 
points of distinction no doubt they could be explored and explained to the public. 

5.22  That is not to say that I do not understand the significance of suggesting measures to be 
followed  both  by  Government  Ministers  and  members  of  the  Opposition  Front  Benches. 
Their positions bear comparison from the point of view of the public interest in transparency, 
but not of course in terms of the regulatory context. The Ministerial Code has no application 
outside government. However, I do not recommend any change that will (or should) have 
the force of law and the Government itself will have to reflect on whether acceptance of 
my recommendations would have implications for the Ministerial Code or would be better 
dealt  with  otherwise.  I  fully  recognise  that  in  both  cases,  although  I  give  an  indication  of 
where I consider improvements could be made, implementing any such steps would have to 
constitute something of a self denying ordinance. 

5.23  Having said that, I have no doubt that the public needs and expects increased transparency 
from all political leaders. Without a limited (but significant) improvement in the visibility of 
contact at the highest levels between proprietors, newspaper editors and senior executives 
on the one hand and those who develop media policy on the other, the public is entitled to 
be sceptical that it is being left out of account in exchanges of influence. I am concerned that 
lack of trust and confidence will inevitably ensue. 

What might be done?

5.24  The  amended  Ministerial  Code  now  requires  of  Ministers  a  quarterly  publication  of  all 
meetings  between  Ministers  and  senior  media  figures,  regardless  of  the  purpose  of  the 
meeting. I suggest therefore that consideration be given to the adoption of the same principle 
of transparency, in the first place for:

1455

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsI(a)  Opposition Front Bench spokesmen;
(b)  meetings involving not just the politicians and media principals themselves but also the 

(c) 

agents of each as described above; and
so far as practicable (about which I say a little more below) meetings between these 
principals or agents in whatever capacity in which the meeting could be said to take 
place. 

5.25 

I recommend that consideration be given also to the publication not merely of the fact of such 
meetings in themselves, but also the fact of any discussion taking place at such meetings of 
media policy issues, by which phrase I mean the formulation and implementation of general 
public policy in relation to the media, including in relation to media standards, as well as any 
significant policy issues or decisions relating to individual media organisations.

5.26  What information might be published about the content of any such discussion should of 
course  be  guided  by  the  particular  public  interest  in  the  transparency  of  such  discussion 
in itself. It must, of course, in doing so have regard to other public interest issues such as 
commercial confidentiality and reasonable personal privacy but, overall, could depend on 
the balance of the public interest on a case by case basis. Even an explanation of the reasons 
for  withholding  information  would  aid  public  understanding.  Enhancing  public  confidence 
depends on the spirit of any such measures and a genuine willingness to address the issue of 
how matters look to the public, rather than a legalistic or bureaucratic focus on the specific 
formulation of any provision. I am not recommending that transparency measures should 
necessarily extend further into content beyond a very general identification of topics covered.

5.27  Furthermore, it is clear that the problem does not simply (or even mainly) arise within face 
to face meetings and, in my view, there is more than a legitimate case for contemplating 
some  limited  transparency  obligation  in  relation  to  other  communications  (such  as 
correspondence, phone, text and e-mail). Again, there should be no suggestion of exhaustive 
new  requirements  for  record  keeping  or  the  collection  of  statistics;  that  would  be  both 
impractical and unnecessary, not to say counter-productive. However I do not consider that 
it need be either intrusive or burdensome for politicians to indicate on a quarterly basis, in 
relation to any individual senior principal within the press (or their agents), by way of general 
estimate,  something  about  the  frequency  or  density  of  such  interactions,  for  example  by 
reference to some common-sense and very general published parameters. I do not suggest 
there is any case for descending into detail or content. 

5.28  My purpose in identifying these possibilities is simply to suggest that consideration be given 
to a moderate, achievable move in the direction of further transparency and improvement 
of public confidence. I re-emphasise that the class of persons within the media to whom it 
is intended to apply is very limited; the point is that it is a category which produces unique 
contexts for press lobbying and, in consequence, unique public interest concerns. 

5.29  Common sense has an overarching part to play. There are, for instance, a number of cases in 
which meetings and other communications may take place extremely frequently, for example 
in the case of close lifelong friends or partners. In cases of genuine impracticability of this 
sort,  it  would  undoubtedly  be  sufficient  simply  to  note  the  fact  of  that  relationship.  Lord 
O’Donnell’s approach to such cases was this:44

44 p38, lines 11-24 and p39, lines 5-12, Lord O’Donnell, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/
uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-14-May-2012.pdf

1456

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI“Where you have a lifelong friend who happens to work in industry X, what you should 
do is disclose that to your permanent secretary and you say you meet this person 
socially all the time. If it were to happen that a policy issue arose where industry X 
was absolutely crucial and it would have a big impact on that, then stronger degrees 
of transparency might be required and you might need to remind the minister that 
actually this person that they socialise with all the time, they have to be particularly 
careful or they might want to amend their behaviour in some way during a particular 
period when that was a big issue.”
….
“All politicians come into politics having developed a social circle already. They have 
friends. It’s a rather good thing, in my view, that politicians have got quite normal 
relationships  and  they  have  friends  from  different  backgrounds,  different  -  maybe 
in  industry,  they  may  be  trade  unionists,  they  may  be  teachers,  nurses.  That’s  a 
good thing.”

5.30  As I said at the time that Lord O’Donnell gave this evidence, I entirely agree and absolutely 
nothing in this Report should be taken as suggesting that this should change. It is difficult 
enough to encourage able people to enter public life and not only must a measure of trust 
be extended to all who do but, additionally, steps must be taken to ensure that they, also, are 
provided with a sufficient amount of private space. I have not, however, found myself able 
to conclude that internal disclosure mechanisms (such as Lord O’Donnell mentions when he 
refers to private disclosure to a senior official) will be sufficient as a means of restoring public 
trust and confidence. The problem is not a narrow one of conflict or propriety; it is a problem 
of public perception and legitimate concern about the extent to which existing accountability 
mechanisms do not provide a sufficient answer. The relationship between the press and the 
politicians, in this albeit limited respect has become something which the public needs to be 
able to see and understand.

5.31 

In conclusion, I have no doubt, that the risks which I am recommending that senior politicians 
address are clear for all to see. If their interactions with senior press and media executives 
are  approached  fairly  and  squarely  with  those  risks  consciously  understood,  and  with 
commensurate respect for public perceptions and the public interest in transparency, this is 
as much as can be achieved. 

In	the	circumstances,	I	recommend	that	Leaders,	Ministers	and	Front	Bench	Opposition	
spokesmen	consider	publishing:

(a)	

the	simple	fact	of	long	term	relationships	with	media	proprietors,	newspaper	
editors	 or	 senior	 executives	 which	 might	 be	 thought	 to	 be	 relevant	 to	 their	
responsibilities;	and
(b)	 on	a	quarterly	basis:

(i)	

(ii)	

details	 of	 all	 meetings	 with	 media	 proprietors,	 newspaper	 editors	 or	
senior	 executives,	 whether	 in	 person	 or	 through	 agents	 on	 either	 side,	
and	the	fact	and	general	nature	of	any	discussion	of	media	policy	issues	at	
those	meetings;	and
a	fair	and	reasonably	complete	picture	by	way	of	general	estimate	only,	of	
the	frequency	or	density	of	other	interaction	(including	correspondence,	
phone,	text	and	email)	but	not	necessarily	including	content.	

1457

Chapter 8 | Conclusions and RecommendationsIImplementation

5.32  There is already room for enormous value to be obtained from acceptance in principle of 
the need for greater transparency. This Inquiry was commissioned with cross-party political 
consensus specifically to respond to public concern; it follows the concession both from the 
Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition that the relationship between the press and 
politicians had become too close. I have set out in this Part of the Report the ways in which 
it seems to me that that closeness has been contrary to the public interest, and insufficiently 
transparent. At the same time, the Inquiry has been conducted against the agreed background 
that, in common with earlier mechanisms for self regulation of the press, the PCC has failed 
to meet the legitimate requirements of the public and must be replaced. Something needs 
to be done.

5.33  How that is to be achieved in practice? Inquiries come and go, but the constant traffic between 
politics and the media is as old as democracy itself. Although the Inquiry has sought to provide 
a very open forum in which both the press and the politicians could explain their positions 
to me, and thereby to the public, this has inevitably taken place against a background of a 
continuing conversation between press and politicians to which the Inquiry and the public 
has not fully been party. Some of that conversation has played out in the editorial and opinion 
pages of the press, and more rarely in the public observations of politicians; much more of it, 
no doubt, more privately.

5.34  With some limited exceptions but as the press are fully entitled to do, even before I concluded 
this Report, they started using their considerable megaphones for their own purposes. It would 
be surprising if they had not done the same with their senior access to those responsible for 
making decisions in this area, that is to say, the Government and other leading politicians. 
This has not, however, happened under the sort of conditions of transparency which I have 
concluded to be an essential component for the restoration of public trust and confidence.

5.35  The Inquiry takes its place historically at the end of decades in which the lobbying activities 
of  the  press  on  the  matter  of  press  standards  have  not  been  conducted  under  the  sorts 
of  considerations  of  transparency  which  I  am  now  recommending  for  consideration.  The 
conclusions of this Report are to the effect that successive governments have failed to meet 
reasonable  public  expectations  in  their  approach  to  this  issue,  evidently  to  at  least  some 
degree under the influence of fear of favour of the press.

5.36 

I am hopeful that genuine, informed, and vigorous public debate about the future of press 
standards will follow the publication of this Report. That can include an evaluation of the 
evidence  which  I  have  set  out  in  detail,  the  merits  of  the  various  policy  options  and  the 
different perspectives which can be brought to the issue from the many who are affected by 
it, as indeed we all are. It is critical, however, that the public must have full confidence in the 
political process engaged in that response; if it does not, the solution will hardly attract the 
public confidence that is essential for it to succeed,

In my view, the public has an entirely legitimate interest in understanding how the decisions 
made about the Report will be taken in the public interest. Obviously, the views of the press 
will be very important but if lobbying is to play a part (particularly if conveyed in private), 
there is a public interest in transparency about that fact and how extensive it has been.

5.38  The onus on leading politicians of the country to seek to reach a consensus conclusion, taking 
account of all the interests affected, will have a significant impact on public confidence for 
another reason. As the Rt Hon Sir John Major graphically put it:45

“I have no idea what this Inquiry will recommend, but if it makes recommendations 
that  require  action,  then  I  think  it  is  infinitely  more  likely  that  that  action  will  be 
carried into legislation if it has the support of the major parties. If it does not, if one 
party breaks off and decides it’s going to seek future favour with powerful proprietors 
and press barons by opposing it, then it will be very difficult for it to be carried into 
law, and I think that is something that is very important. So I think there is an especial 
responsibility on the leaders of the three major parties. 20-odd years ago – 23 years 
ago, I think – a senior minister said the press were drinking in the last-chance saloon. 
I think on this occasion it’s the politicians who are in the last-chance saloon. If, at the 
end of this Inquiry, with the recommendations that may be made – and I don’t seek 
to forecast what they may be, but if the recommendations that are made are not 
enacted and nothing is done, it is difficult to see how this matter could be returned to 
in any reasonable period of time, and those parts of the press which have behaved 
badly will continue to behave badly and put at a disadvantage those parts of the 
press that do not behave badly. 
I reiterate: I think the underlying purpose is to eliminate the bad behaviour and bring 
the bad up to the level of the good, and the bad is just a cancer in the journalistic 
body. It isn’t the journalistic body as a whole. And I think in the interests of the best 
form of journalism, it is important that whatever is recommended is taken seriously 
by Parliament, and it is infinitely more likely to be enacted if neither of the major 
parties decides to play partisan short-term party politics with it by seeking to court 
the favour of an important media baron who may not like what is proposed.”

5.39  The perception of the public may well consider that the phrase “courting favour” accurately 
represents what happens if private lobbying and influence leaves insufficient space for open, 
measured and balanced debate that is based on facts and reasoned argument. 

5.40  The conclusion of this Report is that successive Governments have failed to meet reasonable 
public expectations in their approach to the issue of press standards. These must ensure, 
on the one hand, that the press is free to hold power to account, to conduct investigative 
journalism in the public interest, to provide commentary however partisan or irreverent, to 
fulfil the needs of the public. On the other hand, the press has to be accountable to the public 
in whose interests it claims to be acting and must show respect for the rights of others to such 
extent as legitimate public interest does not justify otherwise. It should not be acceptable

plurality and Media Ownership: 
COnClusiOns and re COMMendatiOns

1.	
1.1 

Introduction
The Terms of Reference require me to make recommendations:

(a) 

(b) 

for a new more effective policy and regulatory regime which supports the integrity and 
freedom of the press, the  plurality of the media, and its independence, including from 
Government, while encouraging the highest ethical and professional standards; and
for  how  future  concerns  about  press  behaviour,  media  policy,  regulation  and  cross-
media  ownership  should  be  dealt  with  by  all  the  relevant  authorities,  including 
Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police.

Specifically, in the context of plurality, I must therefore ensure that my recommendations 
would support media plurality and that I identify how concerns about cross media ownership 
should  be  dealt  with,  including  by  Parliament  and  Government.  This  does  not  amount  to 
a  requirement  for  a  detailed  prescription  on  what  constitutes  sufficient  plurality  or  the 
technical means of achieving it. It is important to note that, within the broad constraints of 
the work that the Inquiry has had to undertake, there has been insufficient time to devote 
to a full scale review or to look in detail at these issues. My analysis and recommendations 
are therefore at the level of desirable outcomes and broad policy framework, rather than the 
technical means of achieving those outcomes. 

1.2 

Part  C  Chapter  4  sets  out  the  importance  of  plurality,  what  it  means  and  the  legislative 
framework in place currently to ensure sufficient plurality in the media. In this Chapter I look 
at the extent to which any change is required and if so, what that change should be.

1.3 

Although set out in Part C, Chapter 4, it is worth repeating the goal by reference to the Ofcom 
definition of the desired outcome of a plural market:

(a) 

“ensuring there is a diversity of viewpoints available and consumed across and within 
media enterprises;

(b)  preventing any one media owner or voice having too much influence over public opinion 

and the political agenda.”1

This approach to both the diversity of views available and the influence wielded seems to be 
generally accepted. 

1.4 

What are the questions that need to be answered?
That  is  more  or  less  where  the  consensus  ends.  The  Inquiry  is  required  to  recommend  a 
regulatory and policy framework that supports plurality and to make recommendations for 
how  future  concerns  in  relation  to  cross-media  ownership  should  be  handled.  These  are

Media-Plurality1.pdf 

1461

Irather partial questions in respect of plurality and do not invite or require the Inquiry to come 
up with a comprehensive or detailed plurality or media ownership framework.

1.5 

The questions that have emerged from the evidence are:

(a)  What should be considered to be the scope of any plurality policy? Does this apply just 

to news and current affairs or should it go wider?

(b)  How should plurality be measured?
(c)  What form should any requirements to support plurality take, and what sort of remedies 

(d) 

should be available to deliver them?
Should  such  controls  be  triggered  only  by  mergers  and  acquisitions  or  is  there  an 
argument for looking to closures and organic growth in the market?

(e)  Who  should  be  responsible  for  measurement  of  plurality,  decisions  on  whether 

remedies are required and decisions on what remedies to apply?
The rest of this chapter seeks to answer each of these questions in turn.

2.  scope
2.1 

By ‘scope’, essentially, I mean the nature of the published content to which any plurality rules 
should  relate.  The  media  ownership  rules  apply  at  the  moment  to  newspapers,  analogue 
television and analogue radio. The governments of the day made it clear, in bringing forward 
the Broadcasting Act 1990 and the Communications Act 2003, that this was because of the 
scarcity of analogue spectrum and the limits that that placed on the number of channels that 
could be licensed. By contrast, they were clear that the same concerns would not apply in the 
multi-channel environment provided by digital broadcasting. In the analogue world, where 
there were only the Channel 3 commercial channels and Channel 5, it was obvious that the 
holder of any one licence would have a significant proportion of the broadcast voice. We are 
now in a wholly multi-channel world. Anyone with access to television in the UK now has 
access to over 40 channels providing a varied diet of news, entertainment, cultural output, 
drama and sport. Anyone with access to the internet in the UK has access to many providers 
of news and information, all the genres available on television and a whole host of other 
forms of digital content. 

2.2 

Ofcom notes that both it, and other regulatory authorities, have concentrated to date on 
news and current affairs, but that this is not required by the legislative framework.2 There are 
arguments for broadening the scope. Stephen Barnett, Professor of Communications at the 
University of Westminster, stressed that, in his opinion, plurality as a concept extends beyond 
the narrowly political to the wider cultural environment.3 He eloquently explained why:4

“corporate cultures will have a direct bearing on decisions such as whether to prioritise 
celebrity stories, or invest in foreign news bureaux, or hire polemical columnists, or run 
a specific campaign (e.g. on Europe, sentencing policy in the criminal courts, or benefit 
levels) and [that] these in turn will impact on the national conversation. The greater 
number of such powerful organisations, the greater the opportunities for diversity of 
all forms of expression.”

2.6 

Similarly, Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis,  pointed out that because media enterprises 
tend to produce a mix of news and entertainment, not only is it difficult to separate them 
economically, but that in practice a media organisation that achieves a very large share of 
the entertainment market will have similarly high levels of economic power both inside and 
outside of that market.5 Thus large media organisations have the power to shape the wider 
cultural agenda of the nation, as well as wielding significant economic power. 

It  is  worth  looking  at  the  issue  of  economic  power  in  more  detail.  Many  of  the  national 
newspaper groups are owned by companies or individuals with significant economic interests 
outside of the newspaper market. The business empires of the Barclay family, Lord Rothermere 
or the Lebedev family would never be capable of inclusion in any form of plurality measure. 
The position of NewsCorp is different because the vast majority of NewsCorp’s interests are 
in the media market. However, it is not obvious that all aspects of the media market will have 
an impact on plurality. BSkyB achieved its high proportion of television subscribers through 
its ability to offer exclusive access to premium sport and film content. It is difficult to see how 
sport coverage can have an impact on plurality of news provision, and the fact that a person 
can access television through a Sky box may have no impact whatsoever on what news or 
cultural  channels  they  watch.  Similarly,  Richard  Desmond  owns  some  adult  TV  channels, 
which might be loosely considered to be in the media market but are unlikely to have any 
impact on plurality in the way we understand it. In order to be consistent, therefore, it is 
important, to consider economic power in relation only to the content that is considered 
relevant to plurality, not economic power more generally.

A further point about economic power is the potential ability of a large media organisation 
to leverage its different distribution channels to cross promote products, or even to engage 
in predatory pricing in one part of the market to the disadvantage of a competitor in order to 
secure an advantage in another part of the market. These are real issues, though not ones for 
the Inquiry. I would urge both Ofcom and the Competition authorities to ensure that, when 
considering  both  plurality  and  competition  issues  in  the  media  sector,  the  ways  in  which 
power is used across a media organisation’s interests is taken into account.

The question to be addressed, then, is what content should be considered relevant to plurality. 
The  media  consultant  Robin  Foster  agreed  that  there  was  a  case  for  starting  with  a  wide 
perspective and looking at wider cultural activity and output in the UK, as different aspects 
of culture and content can have an impact on the way in which we think about our society 
and our understanding of social and political issues. However, he concludes that in practical 
terms the most important focus is on news media and related current affairs, opinion and 
debate.6 Similarly, Ofcom conclude that news and current affairs are the most relevant form 
of content for the delivery of public policy goals and they recommend that the scope of any 
plurality review should be limited to these. 

2.7 

In his capacity as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt adopted a 
similar approach, saying that he shared the view implicit in the guidance issued by the then 
Government in relation to the operation of the plurality provision in the 2003 Act, namely, 
that “plurality” should principally be concerned with the provision of news and current affairs 
as those are the main areas where owners could seek to influence opinions and control the

Chapter 9 | Plurality and the Processes for Decisions Affecting Media Ownership  Ipolitical agenda. 7 As Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Dr Vince Cable also 
agreed:8

“I apply the concept to news and current affairs primarily. There is an argument for a 
diversity of provision of sport, comedy, drama, religious affairs and other items and 
these  issues  are  covered  in  significant  measure  by  the  public  service  obligation  of 
terrestrial channels. But news and current affairs are different since they are of direct 
concern not just to the consuming public but to the functioning of democracy and the 
choice of governments.”

2.8  Whilst the complexity of the media market and public habits of consumption of news and 

entertainment make this a complex issue,

I	 recommend	 that	 the	 particular	 public	 policy	 goals	 of	 ensuring	 that	 citizens	 are	
informed	 and	 preventing	 too	 much	 influence	 in	 any	 one	 pair	 of	 hands	 over	 the	
political	process,	are	most	directly	served	by	concentrating	on	plurality	in	news	and	
current	affairs.	However,	this	focus	should	be	kept	under	review.

2.9 

The  next  question  in  relation  to  scope  is  what  types  of  news  and  current  affairs  media 
are  included  in  the  measure.  It  is  obvious  that  television,  radio  and  newsprint  should  be 
included, as they are today. However, online consumption of news is already significant and 
is increasing, with 41% of adults in the UK regularly using the internet for news.9 All the main 
UK broadcast and print news providers have an online presence, making the internet a very 
significant delivery channel and route to influence for them. In addition, there are new big 
players online, with Ofcom research showing that 19% of people who use the internet for 
news use Facebook and Google News.10 In addition, of course, the internet provides access to 
a profusion of new, individual, smaller voices through, for example, blogs. 

2.10  Robin  Foster  points  to  the  growth  of  news  provision  online,  including  through  content 
aggregators,  search  engines,  social  networking  sites  and  digital  app  stores,  as  a  key 
development. The nature of these delivery mechanisms is such that they could, if they wished 
to do so, act as gatekeepers to the news that their users receive. Thus, the internet has an 
important role to play in distributing news to consumers but there are potential plurality risks 
as those models develop. Mr Foster is clear that online provision should not be ignored when 
considering plurality.11

2.11 

Ofcom	conclude	that	online	should	be	included	in	any	market	assessment.	I	entirely	
agree	with	this	view	and	recommend	that	online	publication	should	be	included	in	
any	market	assessment	for	consideration	of	plurality.

2.12  Ofcom was also asked to consider whether the BBC should be included in any measure of 
plurality.  They  concluded  that,  as  by  some  way  the  biggest  provider  of  news,  it  must  be 
included in any measure of plurality in the market, but that the governance controls in place 
to ensure internal plurality within the BBC, and the effect of the impartiality requirements, 
meant  that  its  size  gave  rise  to  no  plurality  concerns.  This  is  an  interesting  point.  The

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansIGovernance provisions of the BBC require a high degree of editorial independence within the 
Corporation, which, when working effectively, ensure that a diversity of voices and viewpoints 
from the different channels and programmes. This, perhaps, provides a model that would 
help to ensure plurality in relation to other large players in the media market. 

3.	 Measuring	plurality
3.1  Measuring plurality is far from straightforward. There are two outcomes sought: diversity of 
views, and the prevention of excessive influence, and neither is simple to measure. In relation 
to diversity of views, it is necessary not just to look for a proliferation of different voices but 
also for consumption of different voices. The measure must therefore include both a simple 
count  of  the  number  of  voices  available  and  some  measure of  the  extent  to  which  these 
voices are heard or consumed. In relation to excessive influence, the search must be some 
measure not just of how many people are exposed to the voice but also the extent of the 
influence that it has; this may depend on the audience reached, the trust they repose in it 
and the number of other sources that they consult.

3.2 

3.3 

3.4 

3.5 

Ofcom was asked by the Secretary of State to set out options for measuring media plurality 
across platforms and to recommend the best approach.12 They considered three different 
types of metrics: availability, consumption and impact. The first conclusion is that availability 
metrics – the number and range of titles and providers – have a role to play in measuring 
plurality but offer limited insight and on their own are not sufficient.13

Ofcom considered five different types of consumption metrics: the volume of consumption 
(how  much  time  a  consumer  spends  consuming  the  relevant  content);  cross-media 
consumption  (the  extent  to  which  a  single  provider’s  sources  are  consumed  across  the 
different media); revenue (a basic market share measure); reach (a measure of those who 
are exposed to the content) and multi-sourcing (a measure of how many sources a consumer 
uses).14 

Of  these  Ofcom  concludes  that  revenue  is  not  particularly  helpful,  as  most  measures  of 
revenue do not distinguish news and current affairs from other programming, and there is, 
in any case, a less direct relationship between revenue and influence than between revenue 
and economic power.15 

In the event, Ofcom propose a complex set of measures based around share of consumption, 
which they believe provides a good proxy for measuring influence in the news media market, 
and  reach  and  multi-sourcing,  which  provide  a  good  proxy  for  measuring  the  diversity  of 
viewpoints consumed.16 Claire Enders prefers a measure of share of consumption, arguing that 
the other measures have less value.17 Mr Foster endorses Ofcom’s proposals on measurement 
but suggests, in addition, that more work be done on how to compare consumption across 
different media on a more consistent basis. Mr Foster also urges that a better understanding 
be developed of how audiences use their different sources of news and how they use news 
sources to form their views on matters of public debate.18

3.9 

Ofcom’s  consumption  measure  would  be  supplemented  by  a  measure  of  impact.  There 
is no single proxy for impact and Ofcom suggest that the importance that users attach to 
news sources, and their perceptions of the impartiality, reliability and quality of the news 
provided should be taken into account.19 Ofcom also argue that contextual factors should also 
be taken into account. These include regulation and oversight; governance models; internal 
plurality; and the potential power or editorial control exerted by owners within commercial 
organisations.20

In relation to online news providers, Ofcom suggest that the share, and possibly reach, of the 
top news websites would be the best measure to use currently, and that, in any review of the 
measurement framework, the suitability of online measures should be looked at.21

It is clear that there is no single measure that will provide an adequate picture of plurality. 
The  Ofcom  model  is  complex  and  includes  all  the  measures  that  have  been  put  forward. 
In  addition,  Ofcom  suggests  that  the  measurement  framework  itself  should  be  assessed 
regularly to ensure that it continues to capture the key elements of plurality.22 

Ofcom have set out a comprehensive approach that is likely to provide as good a picture 
of  the  plurality  in  the  media  market  as  can  be  derived.  However,  its  complexity  is  also  a 
disadvantage, in that it will be difficult for most people to understand and could come under 
sustained attack from those media providers who feel that they may be the subject of plurality 
concerns. In that context it is significant that BSkyB objected to that methodology, used by 
Ofcom, in the public interest test on the NewsCorp/BSkyB bid.

I	recommend	that	Ofcom	and	the	Government	should	work,	with	the	industry,	on	
the	measurement	framework,	in	order	to	achieve	as	great	a	measure	of	consensus	
as	 is	 possible	 on	 the	 theory	 of	 how	 media	 plurality	 should	 be	 measured	 before	
the	measuring	system	is	deployed,	with	all	the	likely	commercial	tensions	that	will	
emerge.	

4.	 Limits	and	remedies
4.1 

If agreement can be reached on what is meant by plurality, plurality of what and how to 
measure that plurality, the next question is what constitutes sufficient or adequate plurality 
and what can or should be done to ensure maintenance of sufficient or adequate plurality. 

4.2 

Caps on market share
The starting point for some of the witnesses to the Inquiry has been that there should be 
a  fixed  limit  on  the  percentage  of  revenue  of  the  total  cross-media  market.  Specifically, 
Ms  Enders  suggests  that  no  single  company  should  be  able  to  acquire  more  than  15%  of 
the media market by revenue.23 In this context she defines the media market as including: 
national and regional newspapers; consumer magazines; video games; television advertising; 
television  subscription  fees;  books  (both  physical  and  digital);  cinema;  video/DVD  rental

evidence  Ms  Enders  explained  that  neither  the  15%  limit  nor  the  market  definition  were 
specific proposals, but were rather designed as a starting point for discussion.25 

4.3  Ms Enders said that the market definition was: 26 

“trying to draw a media market, not actually a market for plurality purposes.”

It  is  interesting  that,  having  said  that  a  consumption  measure  was  the  best  measure  of 
plurality, her proposed solution depends entirely on a measure of revenue. She explained 
that her proposition was really about getting a debate started on how many big media players 
would be the right number for the UK. A limit of 15% would require at least 7 major players (or 
a very large number of small players). A limit of, 25% would allow consolidation to only 4 big 
media actors.27 Ms Enders clarified that, to the extent that the idea of the cap was a proposal, 
the intention would be that it should operate in relation to mergers and acquisitions, not to 
organic growth.28

4.4 

4.5 

4.6 

The  Rt  Hon  Jeremy  Hunt  MP  told  the  Inquiry  that  it  was  important  that  the  approach  to 
plurality should not stifle innovation or growth in the sector. One option would be to prescribe 
specific limits for media and cross-media ownership, but the regulator would need flexibility 
in operating them, whilst still providing sufficient certainty to business in order to encourage 
investment.29

The Rt Hon Harriet Harman MP suggested that there could be a cap on the percentage of 
revenue of the UK’s total cross media market that any one company or individual would be 
allowed to own, and that there should be a restriction, for example 30%, on the proportion of 
newspaper circulation that could be in the hands of one organisation.30 In addition to the idea 
of a fixed upper cap Ms Harman suggested that transactions leading to a holding of between 
20% and 30% of newspaper circulation should be subject to Ofcom approval and possible 
conditions.31

The Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP said that he was open to a percentage cap, or a figure at which 
an investigation might be triggered, but that he imagined that such a measure would prove 
difficult to define.32 Similarly, the Rt Hon Dr Vince Cable MP felt that the current plurality test 
was too imprecise. He suggested that it might be possible to specify a limit, such as 25% of 
combined media markets, beyond which a plurality test should be applied.33

However,  Ofcom  take  the  view  that  absolute  limits  or  prohibitions  on  market  share,  that 
would require automatic divestment if breached, leave no room for flexibility and give rise to 
the risk that it is not possible to address issues of commercial sustainability and innovation 
in an appropriate manner. They argue that such an interventionist approach should only be 
applied in a targeted manner to those issues of greatest concern.34 

As  well  as  a  media-wide  limit  as  suggested  by  Ms  Enders,  Ofcom  consider  the  case  for 
platform specific limits in relation to newspapers and television. In relation to newspapers, 
the Ofcom report notes that limitations on a declining market run counter to the need for 
newspaper  groups  to  build  market  share  in  order  to  survive.  In  relation  to  television,  the 
report suggests that the existing impartiality rules, and the existence of the BBC under public 
ownership, deliver sufficient regulation for impartiality and that a platform specific cap would 
have limited impact.35

4.9 

Sufficiency
Ofcom propose that, instead of fixed caps, there should be a concept of sufficiency of plurality 
against which to conduct a market review. Unlike a cap, a concept of sufficiency would not be 
precise. Ofcom suggest that a first step could be to set it out in qualitative terms:36

“There is a diverse range of independent news media voices across all platforms.

(a) 
(b)  Overall  reach  and  consumption  is  relatively  high  among  all  consumer  demographics 

(c) 

(d) 

and across all of the UK’s nations and English regions.
Consumers actively multisource – such that the large majority of individuals consume a 
range of different news sources.
Sufficiently low barriers to entry and competition between providers spurs quality and 
innovation in the gathering and dissemination of news.

(e)  Overall investment and commercial returns are sufficiently high to ensure sustainability, 
and  guarantee  high  quality  coverage,  extensive  newsgathering  and  investigative 
journalism.

(f)  No organisation or news source has a share of consumption that is so high as to create 

a risk that consumers are exposed to a narrow set of viewpoints.”

4.10  The report goes on to suggest that it may be possible to develop a set of the levels of each of 
the metrics to be used in measuring plurality that would provide an indication of a plurality 
concern. These would not be limits, but they would provide a degree of clarity to the market 
as to what levels of concentration would be likely to give rise to such concerns.37

4.11  Ms Enders also looks at what might be sufficient plurality. She quotes Professor Charlotte 
Brewer  as  concluding  that  ‘plurality’  unambiguously  meaning  ‘a  large  number’  and  not  a 
number more than one.38 Ms Enders goes on to say that “when we talk of ‘plurality’ we are 
talking of a profusion, a multiplicity and an abundance,” and that it is reasonable to assume 
that Parliament had this in mind when the legislation was passed.39

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI4.12  Whether the approach involves a fixed limit or an indicative level, there needs to be some 
way of identifying the point at which concerns arise. Other than the 15% figure offered, but 
not defended, by Ms Enders, there have been no suggestions as to what level of plurality is 
sufficient. It will certainly be different in different markets: for example, in the many regions 
that have only one local newspaper, it is generally accepted that one is better than none 
and no remedies are applied to what is, by default, a monopoly position. The Inquiry has 
no basis on which to reach a conclusion on what constitutes sufficient plurality, though it 
seems reasonable to conclude that concerns about plurality would arise at lower levels of 
concentration than concerns about competition. 

Structural remedies

4.13  Ofcom note that structural remedies offer clarity and certainty, can deliver long term benefits 
and do not require ongoing monitoring. They also note that such remedies may be ineffective 
if  the  divested  interests  are  commercially  unsustainable.  Structural  remedies  can  act  as  a 
disincentive to investment and innovation and represent a significant regulatory intervention 
and impose potentially significant transition and transaction costs on the parties concerned.40 

Behavioural remedies

4.14  Mr Foster suggests that it would be better to move away from structural remedies, such as 
caps on market share, and towards behavioural remedies. These could include requirements 
to invest in content; requirements to make space available for the inclusion of alternative 
viewpoints; effective right of reply procedures; and independent editorial boards.41

4.15  Ofcom identify three different forms of behavioural remedies that could be used. First, there 
are behavioural rules that may help to increase levels of internal plurality, for example by 
ensuring editorial independence for specific titles, channels or programmes. This approach 
may be less intrusive and more proportionate than structural remedies but would require 
complex  ongoing  monitoring  and  it  does  not  have  a  particularly  good  reputation  for 
effectiveness.

4.16  Second, Ofcom point to behavioural remedies that improve standards. This might include 
requirements on fairness, or accuracy and completeness in what is reported. This approach 
would  be  objective  and  well  understood,  but  would  also  require  ongoing  monitoring  and 
there is a risk that such remedies, if applied too widely, would reduce diversity in content. 

4.17  Finally,  Ofcom  consider  behavioural  remedies  to  improve  access.  Must-carry  obligations 
could  require  a  distribution  platform  to  distribute  the  content  of  news  providers  meeting 
specific criteria, while must-offer obligations could be used to ensure that news providers 
distribute their content via any platform meeting specified criteria. This is a good remedy 
to  address  specific  concerns  about  discrimination  by  gatekeepers.  It  is  unlikely  to  require 
active monitoring as those entitled to access will complain if it is not complied with. However, 
this approach can be susceptible to gaming and can become outdated in the light of market 
developments.42  Robin  Foster  also  considered  access  remedies,  though  specifically  in  the 
context of digital intermediaries. He suggested that a mixture of a guarantee that content 
would not be blocked, must-carry provisions, and an audit mechanism of some sort, might be 
considered should any relevant plurality concerns be identified.43

Chapter 9 | Plurality and the Processes for Decisions Affecting Media Ownership  I4.18 

Positive interventions to encourage more news provision
In addition to remedies designed to control excessive influence, Ofcom note that there is an 
option of taking action to encourage more news provision. This could take the form of public 
funding of news provision or placing obligations in relation to news and current affairs on 
existing providers in return for some benefit. The most obvious examples of this approach are 
the BBC and the public service broadcasting content obligations on Channel 3 and 5 licence 
holders. Remedies of this sort are particularly appropriate where commercial provision of the 
content required is not sustainable. Ofcom note that this approach does not penalise success 
as any of the structural or behavioural remedies might and, furthermore, could be a good way 
of promoting plurality. However, it would require both public funding and very careful design 
to minimise the effect of subsidies on market-based provision.44 Professor Curran also sets 
out proposals for a system of funding for areas of the media underserved by the market.45

4.19  The argument for mechanically applied fixed caps or limits does not seem to me to be made 
out. Given the importance of having both public consensus on what constitutes sufficient 
plurality and sufficient clarity in the market to encourage investment, it would be sensible 
for Ofcom to carry out a consultative process designed to identify indicative levels of the 
various metrics that they are proposing to use that would give rise to plurality concerns. I 
am neither qualified, nor required, to give my own view on what such levels should be, and I 
have no intention of doing so. I do, however, accept that the importance of plurality of news 
and current affairs provision is a qualitatively different issue to those arising from general 
competition concerns.

I	therefore	recommend	that	the	levels	of	influence	that	would	give	rise	to	concerns	in	
relation	to	plurality	must	be	lower,	and	probably	considerably	lower,	than	the	levels	
of	concentration	that	would	give	rise	to	competition	concerns.

4.20 

Ofcom	has	presented	the	Inquiry	and	the	Government	with	a	full	menu	of	potential	
remedies,	 and	 I	 have	 not	 seen	 any	 arguments	 to	 suggest	 that	 any	 of	 them	 are	
inappropriate	 in	 principle.	 Each	 of	 them	 might	 be	 appropriate	 in	 a	 given	 set	 of	
circumstances	and	I	recommend	that	the	relevant	regulatory	authority	should	have	
all	of	them	in	its	armoury.

I can see that this might be difficult, because of the funding implications, in relation to measures 
actively to promote plurality. I am particularly drawn to behavioural remedies that would 
enforce standards, not least because it could add force to other aspects of standards covered 
in this Report. There are strong arguments for requiring a news provider with a substantial 
market  share  to  ensure  editorial  independence  both  from  the  proprietor  or  owner  and 
between titles or media outlets as a means of protecting plurality. There are also respectable 
arguments  for  requiring  a  news  provider  with  a  large  share  of  consumption  to  adhere  to 
accuracy standards and perhaps to have strong internal governance mechanisms to ensure 
that the organisation meets the highest standards of journalism, thus protecting the public, 
both as consumers of news and as potential subjects of reporting. It is, of course, possible 
that one way for an organisation to demonstrate that it was meeting any such requirement 
would be for it to be a member of a recognised self-regulatory body that required the same 
standards, and requiring such membership might form part of a package of remedies.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.	 What	should	trigger	a	review?
5.1 

Under the Communications Act 2003 the public interest in plurality can only be invoked when 
a relevant merger or takeover occurs. Ofcom provided advice to the Secretary of State as part 
of its Public Interest Test in relation to the BSkyB/NewsCorp merger that the current regime 
might no longer be equipped to deliver Parliament’s policy objective of ensuring sufficient 
plurality of media ownership because it was not capable of responding to certain types of 
market development such as market exits or organic growth.46

5.2 

This concern about the need for the plurality regime to be able to take organic growth into 
account was echoed by other witnesses. Harriet Harman proposed both that Ofcom should 
carry out a regular plurality review,47 and that it should have the power to ask the Competition 
Commission to instigate a review in between regular reviews should an issue of monopoly 
arise.48

5.3  Mr Clegg expressed a concern that the plurality considerations in the Communications Act 
2003 are only triggered at the point of a merger or acquisition. He regards this as a significant 
gap in the protection of plurality as:49 

“size isn’t just determined at the point of a transaction. It can, if you like, creep up on 
you through the success of a particular media group just increasing its market share.”

5.4 

5.5 

He suggested that it might be better to have a mechanism to allow an independent regulator 
to  trigger  a  market  review  by  the  Competition  Commission,  taking  into  account  plurality 
concerns.50 

The Secretary of State asked Ofcom to consider what could trigger a plurality review in the 
absence of a merger. Ofcom identified two different potential types of trigger: a metric-based 
trigger, which would require a review to be carried out if a particular metric was breached; 
and a time-based trigger, which would require a review to be carried out automatically on 
a periodic basis.51 A metric-based trigger would require agreement on both the metrics to 
be used and the level at which the trigger would act. Ofcom concluded that the complexity 
involved in setting a metric-based trigger was such that a time-based trigger would be better, 
providing a high degree of simplicity, transparency and certainty to the market.52 In order to 
ensure that reviews take place sufficiently often to pick up significant changes, and with a 
sufficient gap to avoid the risk of a perpetual review cycle, Ofcom propose that regular media 
plurality reviews should take place every four or five years.53 

5.6 

Ofcom also considered whether event-based triggers, such as the closure of a media outlet, 
should be used. On the one hand, the effects of a closure may take some time to become

apparent in the market. On the other hand, if an exit occurred soon after a periodic review 
the effects might not come under scrutiny for some time. Ofcom conclude that there might 
be merit in introducing an exit trigger if an appropriate mechanism can be designed.54

Ofcom also considered whether the existing merger-based trigger should remain. This raises 
questions about the risk of merger-based and time-based reviews overlapping. Ofcom also 
point out that, under the current regime, Ministers have discretion over whether a merger-
based plurality review should take place or not. Again, this would need further thought in a 
system otherwise based around an automatic time-trigger.55 

Finally,  Ofcom  considered  whether  they,  or  Ministers,  should  have  discretion  to  trigger  a 
review.  The  advantage  of  allowing  discretion  is  that  it  introduces  some  flexibility  into  the 
system and provides the potential to target a review on a particular concern. The disadvantage 
is that discretion has the potential to be subjective and can lead to excessive lobbying and 
market uncertainty. Ofcom recommended against allowing either Ministers or the regulator 
to have discretion to trigger a review as long as a provision is introduced for periodic reviews 
every four or five years.56

Alternative approach using the Competition Regime
There is also another possible approach to how and when to carry out a review. The Enterprise 
and Regulatory Reform Bill (ERR), currently before the House of Lords, makes changes to how 
public interest issues are to be dealt with in the context of markets (as opposed to mergers). 
This has the potential to be another way of addressing the issue of plurality concerns that 
could arise as a result of organic growth rather than a specific transaction. 

5.10  Where there are competition concerns about a market, or across markets, the Competition 
Commission can instigate a market study, which will look at whether there are competition 
issues in the market that need to be addressed. Under the new regime, if the Secretary of 
State considers that there may also be a public interest issue in the market he will be able 
to issue a public interest intervention notice which would have the effect of requiring the 
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to include the public interest issues in their market 
study report to the Secretary of State. 

5.11  When the Secretary of State receives the market study report, he or she is then in a position 
to decide if the public interest issue is relevant. If not the CMA proceeds as for an ordinary 
reference. If the public interest (PI) issue is relevant then the Secretary of State has three 
options. The first is that a ‘restricted PI reference’ can be made, meaning that the CMA would 
look at the competition issues only, leaving the Secretary of State to make his own assessment 
of the PI issues. Secondly, a full PI reference can be instituted, meaning that the CMA looks 
at both competition and PI issues and makes recommendations on remedies. Finally, a full PI 
reference can be made and a PI expert, or experts, can be appointed to look at the PI issues 
and feed into the CMA report. The CMA report would then cover both competition and PI 
issues,  taking  account  of  the  expert  advice,  and  recommend  remedies.  In  all  these  cases 
the Secretary of State is required to accept the CMA’s findings in respect of the competition 
issues but has the discretion to make a decision on whether to make a public interest finding 
and, if so, what remedies to implement. If the CMA concludes that there are no competition 
issues that require further examination, the matter goes no further.

1472

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansI5.12  As  currently  drafted  in  the  ERR  Bill  this  regime  has  no  application  to  media  plurality.  The 
only public interest issue that can be raised by the Secretary of State in relation to a markets 
investigation  is  national  security.  However,  it  would  be  possible  for  the  need  for  media 
plurality to be introduced as an additional public interest issue. This would allow the CMA 
to look at media markets from a plurality perspective at any point when competition issues 
arise, and would ensure that the full range of competition remedies were available to deal 
with any problems identified. Such remedies could, for example, include a requirement to be 
a member of a recognised regulatory body. 

5.13  The  potential  disadvantage  is  that  this  process  relies  on  the  existence  of  a  competition 
problem before the Secretary of State can take action to remedy a plurality concern. Given 
that I have accepted the argument that plurality is likely to become a matter for concern at 
lower levels of concentration than would necessarily give rise to competition concerns, it 
is also possible that relying on an approach of this sort could allow excessive loss of voice 
because a competition threshold was not breached. I also note that Ofcom argued that there 
would be market benefits from a regular plurality review, rather than a power to review when 
necessary, because of the risk of market uncertainty from ad-hoc reviews and the extremely 
political nature of the issue that would lead to constant lobbying for a review, recognising 
that the proposal for a regular plurality review is more closely focussed on plurality issues. 

Conclusions on plurality reviews

5.14  These are largely technical regulatory issues on which I see no need to reach a definitive view. 
The need to have a mechanism to take account of organic growth and market exists seems 
unarguable, but the precise mechanism for doing so is essentially a technical issue on which 
the Inquiry is not best placed to reach a definitive conclusion. Ofcom’s suggestions about the 
nature of triggers for a review and the need for a regular review of plurality seem sensible. 
The possibility of using the competition regime may equally have merit. It does seem to me 
unlikely that the two regimes could co-exist without causing considerable uncertainty and the 
risk of competing reviews, run by different bodies, coming up with different recommendations.

I	 therefore	 recommend	 that	 the	 Government	 should	 consider	 whether	 periodic	
plurality	reviews	or	an	extension	to	the	public	interest	test	within	the	markets	regime	
in	competition	law	is	most	likely	to	provide	a	timely	warning	of,	and	response	to,	
plurality	concerns	that	develop	as	the	result	of	organic	growth	recognising	that	the	
proposal	for	a	regular	plurality	review	is	more	closely	focussed	on	plurality	issues.

6.	 Who	should	be	responsible	for	decisions?
6.1 

Potentially the most significant of the questions on plurality is who should be responsible 
for decisions on what happens and when. Many of the politicians who gave evidence to the 
Inquiry had a view on this, some, of course, speaking from recent experience of the difficulties 
that the involvement of politicians in such decisions can give rise to. The majority view was 
that  the  very  fact  that  plurality  is  a  public  interest  consideration  makes  it  important  that 
Ministers continue to have the decision taking role.

1473

Chapter 9 | Plurality and the Processes for Decisions Affecting Media Ownership  I6.2 

The Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP said: 57

“My suggestion on this – I have a concrete suggestion on this – is that – I believe that 
there is a case for saying that if a politician wants to depart from the recommendations 
of  the  Competition  Commission  or  Ofcom,  whoever  it  is,  that  decision  should  be 
challengable by appeal. So in other words, if I’m the minister and I get recommendations 
from the Competition Commission that a bid should be blocked or should go ahead, 
and I take a different view, then there should be recourse to the Competition Appeals 
Tribunal to say not simply was it a reasonable decision but on the merits.”

6.3  Mr Clegg said: 58

“So I think there is a big case to tighten up the remit given to a Secretary of State, 
but  I  nonetheless  think  at  the  end  of  the  day  it  is  a  good  thing  in  a  Parliamentary 
democracy to have people who are accountable to Parliament who have to explain 
why that decision was taken and inasmuch as they have any discretion within what I 
hope will be tighter definitions, why they chose to exercise discretion one way or the 
other.”

6.4 

Dr Cable also felt that politicians should have a role to play in these decisions:59 

“I think it’s right that politicians are involved – elected politicians are involved in the 
process. As we described the first stage of my interview, there is a series of checks 
and balances built in, there is a major role for the regulators, but elected politicians, 
ministers, have a role in the process, and I think that’s absolutely right. I think it’s right 
because when we’re talking about matters of public interest, we’re making qualitative 
judgments. We’re not following a sort of quantitative metric, which is what one would 
normally do with, say, a competition case, and I think it’s right that those decisions be 
made by people who are – have legitimacy through the democratic process, who are 
accountable to Parliament.”60
I  think  where  we  do  have  a  genuine  public  interest  choice  to  make,  I  think  it  is 
appropriate in a democracy that we involve the politicians rather than some kind of 
platonic guardians who are in some sense isolated from the political process.” 

6.5  Mr Hunt, however, took a rather different view: 61 

“There  is  an  argument  that  politicians  should  make  decisions  on  media  plurality 
because  any  such  decision  is,  by  its  nature,  more  subjective  than  an  economically 
based competition test. There is also a view that because of the importance of media 
plurality decisions should only be taken by elected politicians. I do not share this view. 
This is not because I believe it is impossible for politicians to act in an impartial manner 
– I believe I did. But even when they do it is almost impossible to persuade elements of 
the public that justice is being done and being seen to be done.

PART I | The Press and PoliticiansII  note  that  decisions  on  competition  issues  where  there  are  no  public  interest 
considerations are now no longer taken by the politicians but by independent regulators, 
presumably to address the same issue. I believe serious consideration should be given 
to adopting the same approach with respect to decisions on media plurality.”

6.6  Mr  Hunt,  as  Secretary  of  State  for  Culture,  Media  and  Sport,  asked  Ofcom  to  consider 
what alternatives exist in relation to who should take the final decisions in relation to, for 
example, the application of remedies.62 Ofcom refrained from providing a view on this matter, 
considering, very properly, that it is a matter for Parliament to decide, not for a regulator 
to opine on. The current regime places the trigger for a plurality review in the hands of the 
Secretary of State, who then has to take a decision on whether or not to refer the merger 
to  the  Competition  Commission  for  a  second  stage  review.  The  Secretary  of  State  is  also 
responsible, having received advice from the Competition Commission, for making a finding 
on whether the merger would operate against the public interest and whether to impose 
remedies and what those remedies should be.

6.7 

6.8 

6.9 

Ofcom take the view that, in relation to public interest merger reviews, it is important to retain 
a discretionary trigger in order to minimise the burden on industry. The report, however, sits 
firmly on the fence as to whether that trigger should be in Ministerial hands or elsewhere. 
On the one hand, it is argued, where a decision requires a high degree of judgement it may 
be more appropriate for a democratically-elected decision-maker to exercise the discretion 
rather than a regulatory body. This, says Ofcom, is a choice for Parliament to make.63

Along with other aspects of this Report, I agree that this is a choice for Parliament to make. 
However, bearing in mind the context within which this part of the Inquiry has been conducted, 
I consider that it is appropriate that I express a view for the Government and Parliament to 
consider. The public interest process relating to the NewsCorp/BSkyB merger has certainly 
demonstrated just how pressured the role of decision-maker is in this context. The volume 
of lobbying on both Secretaries of State involved, principally from NewsCorp but also from 
the coalition (known as the Alliance) ranged against the merger, was immense. The highly 
politicised nature of these decisions, precisely because they deal with media owners, means 
that they are always likely to be made in a fraught environment. 

Arguments have been made that every politician will have what might be termed baggage 
(whether as a result of prior dealings with the press or otherwise) in relation to the media 
market  that  could  make  them  unable  to  carry  out  a  quasi  judicial  function  in  this  regard. 
First, I do not accept the assumption behind this proposition. Certainly, politicians may well 
have strong views in relation to the media market (as on many other issues), but it is entirely 
conceivable that they can put all irrelevant matters aside and exercise a quasi-judicial role 
in relation to the public interest: in relation to a large number of issues, it would be very 
disturbing if they could not. Second, it is surely false to hope that if the decision were to be 
remitted to a regulator, that the regulator would not also have similarly strong views. It is in 
the nature of large media organisations that every one of us is exposed to their output on a 
regular basis and we all have views (and, in some cases, perhaps prejudices) that might affect 
such a decision if allowed to do so.

It seems to me that those who argue that a public interest decision is rightly for a democratically-
elected decision-maker are right. It is that person who is accountable to Parliament and the 
electorate: that is the nature of our constitutional arrangements. However, having said that, 
it is equally clear that the current system is less than ideal. The experience of the NewsCorp/

BSkyB merger shows nothing if it does not reveal that fact. Under the current regime the 
Secretary of State makes his first referral decision without the benefit of any formal advice. 
Thereafter, advice is available from the independent regulators to provide a guide through 
the subsequent decisions.

I	recommend	that,	before	making	a	referral	decision,	the	Secretary	of	State	should	
consult	relevant	parties	as	to	the	arguments	for	and	against	a	referral,	and	should	be	
required	to	make	public	his	reasons	for	reaching	a	decision	one	way	or	the	other.	This	
would	provide	a	buffer	against	the	criticism	that	a	referral	might	be	made	for	purely	
political	reasons,	and	offer	a	welcome	degree	of	transparency	as	to	the	concerns	that	
have	led	to	any	referral.

In	relation	to	subsequent	decisions,	I	recommend,	likewise,	that	the	Secretary	of	State	
should	remain	responsible	for	public	interest	decisions	in	relation	to	media	mergers.	
However,	as	with	the	first	stage,	there	would	be	an	advantage	in	introducing	a	degree	
of	 further	 transparency	 to	 the	 process.	 At	 present	 the	 Secretary	 of	 State	 simply	
receives	 advice	 from	 Ofcom	 and	 the	 Competition	 Commission	 and	 then	 makes	 a	
decision.	I	recommend	that	the	Secretary	of	State	should	be	required	either	to	accept	
the	advice	provided	by	the	independent	regulators,	or	to	explain	why	that	advice	has	
been	rejected.	At	the	same	time,	whichever	way	the	Secretary	of	State	decides	the	
matter,	the	nature	and	extent	of	any	submissions	or	lobbying	to	which	the	Secretary	
of	State	and	his	officials	and	advisors	had	been	subject	should	be	published:	the	fact	
of	having	to	record	such	contacts	would	itself	act	as	a	restraint	both	upon	lobbyists	
and	politicians	and	serve	to	remind	each	of	the	quasi-judicial	nature	of	the	decision	
being	made.	

6.12  On the surface, this might not appear to make much change to the current provision, but I 
believe that it does. If the Secretary of State is required to articulate and publish the submissions 
received and also the reasons for rejecting the independent advice of the regulator, thereby 
giving the opportunity to those adversely affected by the decision, if so advised, to mount a 
challenge by way of judicial review, it will ensure both the highest standards of probity and 
that a very rigorous test is applied to the reasoning behind the eventual position. This would 
not prevent a Secretary of State from rejecting the advice of the independent regulators if he 
or she believes, and can demonstrate and articulate, that it is in the public interest to do so, 
but it would require a real and convincing public interest explanation to exist.
