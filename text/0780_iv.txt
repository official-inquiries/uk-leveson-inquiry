This Part of the Report returns to the conduct of the press and provides the context in which 
the conduct of the press in any particular case can be challenged. A broad outline of the 
criminal and civil law in so far as it might impact on journalists is set out in Appendix 4 but the 
substantive law only goes so far. 

For the criminal law, it is important also to consider the practical difficulties which reduce the 
prospect of a criminal investigation being started, let alone continue to fruition and result 
in prosecution. Chapter 2 identifies the argument that has been advanced by some that the 
matters giving rise to this Inquiry are a consequence of a failure of criminal law enforcement 
rather than anything else, and outlines what I consider to represent the reality of modern 
policing  and  the  investigation  of  crime.  It  deals  with  the  circumstances  in  which  criminal 
investigations  are  instigated  and  the  issues  that  are  likely  to  be  faced  in  the  gathering  of 
evidence. 

The Chapter then goes on to analyse the role that acting in the public interest should play 
within the criminal law. This is first in relation to the decision to prosecute: after the issue 
was raised by the Inquiry, the Director of Public Prosecutions consulted on the topic and then 
issued a formal guideline. It also considers the way in which the public interest might impact 
on later aspects of the criminal process as a consequence of judicial management, the jury 
and (if a conviction is recorded) sentence. 

Possible  changes  for  the  future  are  then  considered.  These  include  the  preparation  of 
guidelines should the maximum sentence for offences under s55 of the Data Protection Act 
1998  be  increased  along  with  the  submissions  made  by  the  Deputy  Commissioner  of  the 
Metropolitan Police in relation to the Police and Evidence Act 1984. 

Chapter 3 concerns the civil law. Here the focus is not on the substantive law but, rather, 
on  the  impact  of  different  costs  regimes  on  the  civil  justice  system  and,  in  particular,  the 
consequences of proposed changes in the law surrounding funding that are likely substantially 
to affect litigation against the press. 

On the basis that the costs regime is about to change to the disadvantage of those wishing 
to  pursue  civil  litigation  with  the  benefit  of  a  Conditional  Fee  Agreement  (which  has  led 
to an increase in the award of general damages in personal injury litigation), damages for 
defamation, breach of privacy and other media torts also fall for review, as does the issue 
of aggravated and exemplary damages. The other procedural law issue discussed concerns 
the mechanism for introducing incentives in relation to the costs of litigation if a regulator 
provides a system of arbitration.

1.7 

Chapter 4 is different and does not look to the future. The Terms of Reference require the 
Inquiry to consider the extent to which the current regulatory framework has failed. That 
requires a detailed consideration of the operation of the Press Complaints Commission.

Introduction
The  criminal  law  can  touch  upon  the  work  of  journalists  in  many  ways  and  inevitably 
prescribes the ways in which it is acceptable for stories to be obtained. A detailed summary 
of aspects of the criminal law most likely to be engaged in the pursuit of journalism is set out 
in Appendix 4 but it is not intended to be comprehensive: by way of example, aspects of the 
behaviour of Neville Thurlbeck as he pursued a follow up to his scoop relating to Max Mosley 
were described by Mr Justice Eady as containing “a clear threat to the women involved that 
unless they cooperated … (albeit in exchange for some money)”, making the point that it was 
“elementary that blackmail can be committed by the threat to do something which would 
not, in itself, be unlawful”.1 There is no doubt room for other potential offences to be engaged 
in the unprincipled pursuit of a story.

On the basis that what was believed to have taken place at the News of the World (NoTW) 
(ignoring what might have happened elsewhere) consisted of the commission of crime, it 
has been suggested that this Inquiry is unnecessary, if not misconceived. It is argued that 
the problem, if such there was, did not lie with the press but with the police for their failure 
to  investigate  crime;  furthermore,  because  of  the  existence  of  the  criminal  law,  these 
issues simply do not require further attention in general or regulation in particular. Without 
attempting to list all of those who have developed the same argument, it is worth mentioning 
three different ways in which the point has been articulated.

1.3 

First, in one of the seminars prior to the commencement of the hearings during the course of 
an address concerned with defending free expression, Kelvin MacKenzie, the former editor 
of The Sun, said:2

“Yes there was criminal cancer at the News of The World. Yes there were editorial and 
senior management errors as the extent of the cancer began to be revealed. But why 
do we need an inquiry of this kind?
There are plenty of laws to cover what went on. After all 16 people have already been 
arrested and my bet is that the number may well go to 30 once police officers are 
rounded up.
Almost  certainly  they  will  face  conspiracy  laws,  corruption  laws,  false  accounting 
laws. There are plenty of laws that have been broken. Lord Leveson knows them all 
by heart.
Supposing these arrests didn’t come from the newspaper business. Supposing they 
were  baggage  handlers  at  Heathrow  nicking  from  luggage,  or  staff  at  Primark 
carrying out a VAT swindle, or more likely, a bunch or lawyers involved in a mortgage 
fraud would such an inquiry have ever been set up.
Of course not.”

J1.4 

Ian Hislop, the Editor of Private Eye, put the matter in this way:3

“I do think that statutory regulation is not required, and most of the heinous crimes 
that  came  up  and  have  made  such  a  splash  in  front  of  this  Inquiry  have  already 
been  illegal.  Contempt  of  court  is  illegal.  Phone  tapping  is  illegal.  Taking  money 
from – policemen taking money is illegal. All of these things don’t need a code. We 
already have laws for them. The fact that these laws were not rigorously enforced 
is, again, due to the behaviour of the police, the interaction of the police and News 
International, and – I mean, let’s be honest about this – the fact that our politicians 
have been very, very involved, in ways that I think are not sensible, with senior News 
International people ...”

1.5 

Finally, the Rt Hon Michael Gove MP said exactly the same thing:4

“I have a prior belief that we should use the existing laws of the land and individuals 
and institutions should be judged fairly, on the basis of the existing laws of the land – 
... and that the case for regulation needs to be made very strongly before we further 
curtail liberty. ...
I think the best way of making sure that people obey the law is making sure that the 
police are appropriately resourced to investigate crime, that the courts hear the case 
for the prosecution and the defence and then, if someone is found guilty, that they 
face the consequences. I fear for liberty if those principles are eroded.”

1.6 

1.7 

The  argument  goes  in  this  way.  If  a  journalist  intercepted  a  message  on  somebody  else’s 
mobile telephone, without their permission, that journalist has committed a criminal offence 
and should be investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted in exactly the same way as would 
occur if anybody else did the same thing. Journalists should be subject to the same law as 
everyone else but should not be subject to any additional regulatory restriction when all that 
each one is doing is exercising his or her right to free speech. A subsidiary argument (also 
advanced by a number of witnesses) goes further. Far from imposing additional regulation on 
the journalist, the importance of free speech and the obligation of the press to hold power to 
account should be recognised in the criminal law, so that, if a journalist is acting in the public 
interest in pursuing a story, he or she has a defence to any crime necessarily committed while 
doing so. The defence to a breach of s55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), along with 
the unimplemented amendments contained within the ss77-78 of the Criminal Justice and 
Immigration Act 2008, is discussed later, but the argument is that no journalist should be in 
peril of conviction of crime while pursuing a story in the public interest (or, presumably, while 
pursuing a story that he or she perceives to be in the public interest).

These arguments fail to recognise the way in which the criminal law operates and the practical 
limitations facing the police and prosecuting authorities, however enthusiastic their wish to 
detect all those committing criminal offences might be. The way in which Operation Motorman 
was pursued by the Information Commissioner and Operation Caryatid (later reconsidered 
on a number of occasions) by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has been the subject 
of detailed analysis.5 At this stage, the intention is not to consider the specific investigations 
(although some aspects will be identified where relevant) but rather to examine the over-
arching constraints which face the police and the courts in the investigation, detection and 
prosecution of crime in general and crime involving journalists in particular.

Chapter 2 | The Criminal Law J2.	 The	investigation	of	crime:	complaints	to	the	police
2.1 

Crimes  come  to  be  notified  to  the  police  and  investigated  in  a  number  of  different  ways. 
First and most likely is that a complaint of crime or possible crime is made to the police. The 
victim of, say, a burglary or a robbery will contact the police and report the matter. Equally 
plausible is that the police will be notified in the event that the victim of, say, a shooting 
attends hospital. Alternatively, the police might themselves either be called to the scene of 
a crime (whether by a victim or witness) or they might be present and witness events for 
themselves (such as might occur during an occasion of public disorder). This report might 
be immediate and contemporaneous with events; it might follow after days (a burglary only 
detected when the householder returns home after holiday); after weeks or months (fraud); 
or even after many years (historic sexual abuse). Howsoever it occurs, the police will then 
take statements from witnesses and pursue such investigations as they can. An inquiry might 
involve  scenes  of  crime  officers,  forensic  scientists  or  other  experts;  it  might  involve  the 
collection of documentary or other real evidence; it might involve the pursuit of information 
from those who might know who is responsible. Leads will be followed up and, in the most 
complex cases, a computer system such as HOLMES6 used to collate evidence and ensure that 
all appropriate avenues are explored.

2.2 

Second, for some criminal offences (and, in particular, for some of the most serious and those 
which do not generate victims likely to complain to the police), rather than wait for a possible 
victim, the police will target either an offence or a suspected offender. By way of example, 
large scale supply of Class A drugs may well be detected because of some intelligence leading 
to surveillance and the development of evidence in that way. Police resources may well be 
devoted to target serious criminal activity without waiting for the crime to be committed. In 
this type of case, however, again, evidence will be followed up, collated and researched in 
the same way.

2.3  Whatever might have drawn the attention of the police either to the crime or the alleged 
criminal, many of the same investigative techniques will be deployed in order to bring those 
guilty of crime before the courts. Thus, during the course of an investigation for an indictable 
offence,  a  search  warrant  or  search  warrants  can  be  obtained  and  the  relevant  evidence 
seized.7  Additionally,  assuming  reasonable  grounds  can  be  established  that  an  indictable 
offence has been committed, a suspect may be arrested and, pursuant to s18 PACE, the police 
can search any premises occupied or controlled by that person both in relation to that offence 
and any other indictable offence connected with or similar to that offence.

2.4 

Once lawfully on premises being searched, the police can seize anything which the officer has 
reasonable grounds for believing has been obtained in consequence of the commission of an 
offence (to prevent it being lost damaged, altered or destroyed), along with anything which 
the officer has reasonable grounds for believing constitutes evidence in relation to an offence 
being investigated or any other offence.8 When it comes to journalistic material, there are 
very important restrictions to these powers which shall require detailed consideration but, for 
the present, it is sufficient to identify the possibility that these searches (and any interviews 
similarly conducted pursuant to powers in PACE) may reveal further evidence.

2.6 

This very potted and non-exhaustive summary9 is important simply because it underlines the 
vital importance of what constitutes the trigger for a police investigation. In the first case, 
it was the complaint of the victim or other knowledge that a crime had been committed. 
In the second, it was the intelligence or suspicion that crime was in train. Something had to 
start the investigative ball rolling. Even for the least serious criminal offences, there has to 
be something. Speeding is now detected with the use of specific speed cameras; the use of a 
mobile telephone when driving, or failure to wear a seat belt, however, are only detected if 
someone (usually a police officer but, perhaps for some offences, a traffic warden) sees the 
offence being committed and does something about it.

Turning  to  the  offences  which  may  be  committed  by  journalists  in  pursuit  of  a  story,  the 
absence  of  a  victim  who  is  aware  of  the  fact  of  the  offence  means  that  there  will  be  no 
complaint.  Neither  can  reliance  be  placed  on  the  possibility  that  a  complaint  might  be 
generated which will reveal what has been going on sufficiently to expose all such criminal 
wrongdoing. Both in Operation Motorman and Operation Caryatid, what was significant was 
not the original complaint (in the first case relating to the passing on of information from 
the DVLA and, in the second, relating to personal details concerning a member of the Royal 
Household  of  sufficient  significance  itself  to  cause  a  substantial  police  investigation  to  be 
undertaken). Rather, it was the entirely fortuitous discovery of a mountain of information in 
the form of the records kept by Steve Whittamore and Glenn Mulcaire respectively.

2.7  Without those records, nobody would have been any the wiser about the extent to which Mr 
Whittamore was providing personal data in clear breach of s55 of the DPA and the subsequent 
exposures would never have seen the light of day. Without the many pages of Mr Mulcaire’s 
records,  the  fact  that  names,  addresses,  phone  numbers,  PIN  details  and  other  links  had 
been gathered and recorded, the inference from all of which being that it could be alleged 
that there was wholesale and industrial interception of mobile telephone messages, would 
all have remained unrevealed. Even if the Guardian or the New York Times had managed to 
obtain sufficient information to enable the police to rely, without more, on the factual basis 
of the stories as published, the extent of what was going on would have remained hidden. 
The history of these particular investigations have been analysed at length but it would be 
truly remarkable if, because in each case of one specific complaint, the police had managed 
to identify the only private detectives indulging in this type of intrusion.

2.8 

2.9 

The same is so, but even more so, in relation to the bribery of public officials. Putting the 
question  of  public  interest  to  one  side  for  a  moment,  there  will  be  no  complaint  to  the 
police about such conduct because it will be undetectable unless the public official is foolish 
enough to make some admission or leave some incriminating evidence around for someone 
else to see. The journalist will not reveal his or her source for a story (on which see below) 
and, irrespective of the likely public interest in the story (or, just as likely, the absence of 
any discernible public interest), it will be almost impossible to get to the bottom of it. Leak 
inquiries almost inevitably fail to achieve their purpose.

Considerable emphasis was placed on the fact that the Information Commissioner has always 
made it clear that, since the reports What Price Privacy and What Price Privacy Now, he has 
not received complaints in relation to journalism; in relation to bribery, the present work of 
the MPS under the umbrella of Operation Elveden is also identified as demonstrating that 
this type of behaviour is also subject of rigorous police investigation. Neither of these facts, 
however, supports the wider propositions which are advanced.

9 Appendix 4

1483

Chapter 2 | The Criminal Law J2.10  What is not acknowledged is the fact that absent evidence to point to the commission of 
an  offence  (which  requires  rather  more  than  mere  assertion  before  any  report,  let  alone 
investigation, can be considered justifiable), nobody who has been the subject of intrusion 
will necessarily be aware of the circumstances in which information about them came to enter 
the public domain. At its highest will be a concern that someone has provided information to 
a journalist which has then been published but any attempt to identify from whom or how 
that material was obtained will fail on the basis that no journalist will reveal a source.

2.11  Neither  will  anybody  be  aware  that  a  particular  story  has  been  obtained  because  money 
changed hands with a public official. Again, reference has been made to the fact that Operation 
Elveden has led to a large number of arrests of journalists and, in addition, public officials, 
the inference being that this is simply a consequence of the police doing the work that they 
always  could  have  done  had  they  properly  investigated  the  documentation  that  they  had 
in their possession. That is not, however, the way in which Deputy Assistant Commissioner 
Akers put the matter. She said:10

“The Management and Standards Committee (MSC) is an independent body outside 
of NI and was formally established by News Corp on 21 July [2011]. ... In this role they 
respond to requests for information from the police which we consider are relevant 
to  our  inquiries.  Our  aim  is  to  identify  criminality.  It  is  not  to  uncover  legitimate 
sources and therefore the MSC responds in a manner that seeks to protect legitimate 
journalist sources at all times. They are also overseeing the searches being conducted 
of the 300 million emails produced by NI.
... The MSC’s role and remit is important to Operation Elveden as current legislation 
would make it difficult, if not impossible,  for police to access material of the type 
it is seeking without that assistance. Where there is an evidential base to request 
information, the MSC have provided it in an unredacted format in order to enable 
police to identify the public official concerned. However, in relation to wider requests 
regarding the system by which alleged cash/cheque payments were made, the MSC 
provide information to police in a redacted form, i.e. with the names of the potential 
source redacted, until police are able to produce evidence that can justify identifying 
the source.”

2.12  The same point was made during the course of her evidence in these terms:11

“Q.  Now a general point which I think should be made is that have you been receiving 
assistance by the MSC, which, of course, is the independent review team within News 
International?
A.  The Management Standards Committee in News International. Yes, we have been 
receiving – we’ve got a co-operative working relationship with them, and they are the 
people who have passed us information upon which we’ve made arrests, as well as 
supplying information to us when we’ve made requests.” 12

Morning-Hearing-6-February-2012.pdf
12 As I have made clear in Part E Chapter 5, there is an issue about the way in which the relationship between the 
Management and Standards Committee and the MPS has recently developed. I repeat that I am satisfied that it is not 
appropriate to elaborate further although the assistance upon which the police have had to depend only serves to 
make the point that this Chapter identifies

1484

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ2.13 

It is not, perhaps, surprising that there has been considerable criticism of News International 
(NI) for providing such help to the police and, to put the matter colloquially, for “shopping” 
or “grassing” on their own employees. The contrary view is that the company has been very 
concerned to demonstrate that whatever has happened at the NoTW (or other titles under 
their control) has not only been without the authority of the most senior management of the 
company but also is entirely contrary to the principles on which the company operates. As a 
result, the company has done all that it can to assist the police where prima facie evidence of 
criminal behaviour has been identified. The words ‘prima facie’ are very important because 
NI  has  not  conceded  that  criminal  offences  have  been  committed  but  only  that  police 
investigation is justifiable.

2.14  Thus,  the  mere  fact  that  there  are  lengthy  investigations  of  phone  hacking  (Operation 
Weeting) and the bribery of public officials and others (Operation Elveden) is not evidence 
that it was and always has been open to the police to conduct the type of investigation now 
underway. Without the active cooperation of NI, it is clear that the extensive investigations 
would not have been possible: evidence of the earlier (different) approach is clear from what 
happened when the police sought to investigate in 2005 during Operation Caryatid which is 
outlined above.13

2.15 

It  must  be  emphasised  that  these  points  are  not  made  to  imply  that  there  has  been  any 
breach by a journalist of the data protection legislation in the period since 2006 or, indeed, 
that the payment of public officials for stories provided in breach of their duty is necessarily 
more  extensive  than  has  been  revealed  or  is  suspected  as  a  result  of  recent  disclosures. 
Equally, however, the absence of complaint is little better than neutral and does not mean 
that steps should not be taken by newspaper organisations to put into place a regime that 
provides positive reassurance that the law is not being breached (save only in relation to data 
protection offences where the public interest justifies it). I am perfectly prepared to accept 
the  evidence, for  example, from  Associated  Newspapers  Ltd,  that  as  a  result  of  a  specific 
instruction from the editor-in-chief, no private detective has been engaged by the company 
since the publication of What Price Privacy Now, but this assertion to the Inquiry cannot take 
the place of a regular and verifiable audit.

2.16  Putting complaint by a victim to the police to one side, the second approach to the detection 
of crime is similarly of little value in cases such as might arise in relation to the press. The fact 
is that it is almost inconceivable that the gathering of intelligence in a covert manner would 
be considered as either necessary or, in any event, appropriate. Not only is it unlikely that the 
criminality which could be revealed would be of sufficient gravity to justify such steps but, in 
addition, it is not clear how such information gathering could be undertaken.

3.	 The	investigation	of	crime:	gathering	evidence
3.1 

Assuming that a complaint has been made to the police, the problems facing any investigator 
have only just begun not least because of the respect which the law accords to journalists, 
the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and a free press and the entirely legitimate 
responsibility of the press to hold power to account. Such is the significance of these important 
principles that very real safeguards are built into the law to provide protection.

3.2 

A detailed analysis of the powers and duties in respect of the search and seizure when that 
impacts on the work of journalists is set out in Appendix 4. It is sufficient to emphasise that 
material acquired or created for the purpose of journalism, held on a confidential basis by a 

13 Part E, Chapter 4

1485

Chapter 2 | The Criminal Law J3.3 

3.4 

person who acquired or created it for that purpose, constitutes excluded material pursuant to 
ss11(1) and 13 of PACE and other journalistic material constitutes special procedure material 
(see s14 of the Act). Search for such material is covered by the more restrictive provisions set 
out in Schedule 1 of the Act, which require the judge called upon to consider an application 
for production or a warrant to have regard the public interest; this is wide enough to include 
the importance of the impartiality and independence of the press, the potential stifling of 
public debate or other relevant factors.14

These protections are not, of course, designed to protect journalists from the consequences 
of their own deliberate criminality unconnected with the public interest, but the law certainly 
explains why DAC Akers expressed herself in the way in which she did in her evidence. One 
of the results of the legislation is that, in protecting what it is entirely appropriate to protect, 
there is a risk that behaviour which deserves no protection will not be uncovered. It makes it 
that much more difficult to obtain evidence to support (or, indeed, to undermine) a complaint, 
making much more remote the prospect of prosecution even where the true facts, if they 
were known, would demonstrate that such a prosecution was entirely merited.

These difficulties both in relation to complaint and investigation only serve again to put the 
burden on journalists to respect the reasons for their freedoms and not to abuse that protection 
by invoking it to cover up that which cannot be justified. They also utterly undermine the case 
that all allegations of criminality can be left to the police to be investigated in exactly the same 
way that other allegations of crime are investigated. Thus, if there are these protections in law 
which, I accept, are entirely and fully justifiable, there must be some other way in which the 
press itself and the journalists who work within it can be held to account in relation to their 
own conduct.

4.	 A	failure	of	policing
4.1 

Against this background it is necessary to consider the wider point that this Inquiry should 
examine the failure of the police to investigate phone hacking, rather than the activities of 
the press. The argument is that the Mulcaire notes were available to the police for them fully 
to investigate yet, for years, they did nothing. The detailed discussion of Operation Caryatid 
appears above15 but this question must be considered not just in the context of that case 
but as a systemic issue concerned with the balance between what conduct should fall only 
to those responsible  for law enforcement and what conduct should  be of concern of any 
business (and its employees) as to the way in which it goes about what it does. This has to be 
considered both at an individual but also a corporate level.

4.2 

A number of witnesses were asked whether, at an individual level, the suggestion that all 
that  had  transpired  was  a  failure  of  policing  might  seem  like  blaming  the  police  for  their 
failure to stop motorists speeding, rather than the motorist for speeding in the first place. It 
is certainly unarguable that there are no small number of offences that are committed when 
it is believed by their perpetrators that they will not be detected and, in the most part, they 
are not detected. Perhaps not surprisingly, cars slow down when approaching speed cameras 
and speed up after the risk of being caught is passed. Few can drive or walk on the streets 
without seeing drivers use mobile telephones notwithstanding the prohibition on doing so. 
These are, however, individual offences committed by individuals: there is no mechanism to 
encourage or exhort those individuals to obey the law, other than the risk that an offence will 
be detected and the offender pursued.

4.5 

That is not to say that procedures cannot be put into place that allow the extent to which 
individuals  are  complying  with  the  law  to  be  monitored.  Pursuing  the  motoring  analogy 
(without in any sense suggesting that there is an equivalence between motoring offences 
and the type of offending with which the Inquiry has been concerned or, indeed, between the 
privilege of being able to drive and the right to free expression), such measures are required in 
connection with the use of certain types of heavy goods vehicles. In one sense, the driver of a 
heavy goods vehicle is individually responsible for observing the speed limits, rest regulations 
and other obligations placed upon him for reasons of general road safety. Breaching those 
regulations constitutes an offence but it would obviously seldom realistically be possible for 
the authorities to follow a driver to ensure compliance. By requiring every such vehicle to 
be fitted with a tachograph, however, compliance can be monitored and a check made to 
discover whether the driver is, in fact, complying with his legal obligations.16

It is possible to pursue this analogy a little further by considering the corporate level. Although 
employers may have difficulty monitoring the way in which their employees drive company 
cars not required to have a tachograph, the requirement on employers to ensure that heavy 
goods vehicles are fitted with a tachograph and that the appropriate records for each vehicle 
are maintained allows a system of audit for the employer to check on drivers and for the 
authorities to check on employers. A rogue driver, regularly breaching the regulations, should 
be discovered; if he is not and, even more so, if there are many such rogue drivers within one 
organisation, conclusions as to the cultural approach to road safety within that organisation 
can legitimately be drawn. Moving away from road traffic, it is commonplace for organisations 
with regulatory obligations to put into place compliance mechanisms intended to promote 
(if  not  ensure)  proper  practice.17  Equally,  compliance  is  encouraged  by  an  organisation  if 
its culture, or the law, requires self-reporting to the regulator in the event that a breach is 
discovered.18 This approach does no more than reflect that the police (or a regulator) cannot 
be everywhere all the time and will not be well placed to detect impropriety which is likely to 
remain hidden, particularly when there is no complainant and, thus, no complaint.

For the press, of course, there is no such regulatory regime and there is no suggestion that 
there should be. But the problem remains: what can be done to ensure that the law (and, 
perhaps, an ethical code) is treated with respect by all and that a culture is maintained to the 
effect that short cuts to obtaining a good story must not involve conduct which responsible 
journalists would consider reprehensible? If any journalist truly believes that almost anything 
goes in pursuit of a story, and that the basis for that story will be protected by the newspaper 
concerned  as  a  journalistic  source  which  will  never  be  revealed,  and,  furthermore,  this 
approach works, it is not surprising if a culture to that effect develops and the police will 
simply never be involved. This culture can, however, be avoided if the editor and newspaper

another individual or person is engaged in money laundering; and the information came to them in the course of 
their business in the regulated sector. It is an offence for an individual working in the regulated sector not to report to 
their ‘Nominated Officer’ or SOCA if the conditions for reporting have been met. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 also 
makes it an offence for a nominated officer not to disclose to SOCA if the conditions for reporting have been met (see 
sections 330 and 331)

Chapter 2 | The Criminal Law Jinsist  on  a  record  (capable  of  being  audited  by  someone  should  problems  arise)  which 
ensures that decisions are made about the ways in which certain types of stories are obtained 
by  reference  to  identifiable  principles  and  at  an  appropriate  level  within  the  news  room. 
The issue of robust internal governance and the value which might be obtained from such 
an approach is further discussed in connection with the approach of the civil law analysed 
below.19

4.6  Whether or not there was a failure in policing does not impact on the culture, practices and 
ethics of the press, save only to the extent that anyone might have thought that the absence 
of  complaint  might  have  encouraged  an  atmosphere  in  which  less  attention  was  paid  to 
the legality of what was being done than should have been. To put the same point another 
way, the question that must be addressed is whether there was a feeling of impunity within 
newsrooms generally or one or more specific newsrooms in particular.

5.	 Police	resources
5.1 

There is a further problem in seeking to cast responsibility for the overall present state of 
affairs on the police on the basis that there has simply been a failure of law enforcement. The 
approach, so far, has proceeded on the basis that police manpower resources are limitless and 
that if there is a complaint which is sufficiently based in provable fact to justify investigation, 
that  investigation  will  be  undertaken.  The  safeguards  in  the  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence 
Act (PACE) 1984 designed to protect journalistic material will be respected and the matter 
pursued,  whether  or  not  that  will  permit  sufficient  evidence  to  be  disclosed  to  convert  a 
complaint into a case which can be put before a prosecutor with sufficient prospect of success 
to justify commencement of a prosecution. In fact, superimposed on the limitations based 
upon the unlikelihood of there being a complaint, and the potential legal and other problems 
that an investigation will have to address, is the fact that police investigative resources are by 
no means limitless and work has to be prioritised in relation to every aspect of policing. It is 
therefore inevitable that a decision will have to be taken at an early stage whether the public 
interest sufficiently requires resources for this type of investigation, perhaps at the expense 
of investigating other criminal activity or undertaking other types of police work.

5.2 

In that regard, it is not sufficient to point to the activities of the MPS since January 2011, 
when  for  understandable  reasons  concerned  with  their  reputation  and,  in  addition,  the 
Crown  Prosecution  Service,  very  considerable  resources  have  been  devoted  to  all  the 
evidence initially available from the search of the home of Mulcaire and now supplemented 
by  material  from  the  Management  and  Standards  Committee  at  News  International.  The 
circumstances of these investigations and the prior history is analysed at length20 but these 
are exceptional. The truth is that in relation to individual specific complaints, the complexity 
of any investigation, the likely attitude of the relevant newspaper to the provision of evidence 
and the difficulty of securing sufficient evidence potentially to satisfy the very high burden 
cast  upon  prosecutors  will  almost  inevitably  mean  that  a  conclusion  will  be  reached  that 
resources are better devoted to other, and arguably more serious, complaints of crime.

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ5.3  More than a few witnesses made it clear that the police were simply not interested in pursuing 
complaints when made. By way of example, Sheryl Gascoigne21 and Sienna Miller22 explained 
to the Inquiry that complaints about being pursued by the press were not investigated or 
taken further. In one sense, Mr Gove was absolutely right; the police should be appropriately 
resourced to investigate crime; unfortunately, until resourced to investigate every complaint 
while,  at  the  same  time,  carrying  on  the  very  many  other  duties  cast  upon  the  police, 
priorities will be inevitable. The fact that certain crimes (if crimes they ultimately turn out to 
be) will be considered a low priority, perhaps because of the inherent risks and complexity in 
undertaking an investigation into them, (or the very limited prospects that an investigation 
will be successful) does not, or should not, impact on the propriety or justifiability of them 
being committed.

6.	 Public	interest:	a	defence	to	crime
6.1 

The analysis of the criminal law reveals that the only offence in respect of which there is a 
specific defence in law is that contained within s55 of the DPA (namely whether, objectively, 
the obtaining, disclosing or procuring of personal data was justified as being in the public 
interest  which  concept  is  undefined).  As  part  of  the  legislative  proposal  contained  within 
s77-78 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, not yet in force, an increase in the 
maximum penalty for breach of s55 of the DPA sits alongside a new defence which covers 
the  position  where  a  person  acts  for  special  purposes  (including  journalism)  with  a  view 
to the publication of journalistic material in the reasonable belief (subjectively held by the 
journalist) that the obtaining, disclosing or procuring of the data with a view to publication 
was in the public interest.

6.2 

It has been suggested that, far from extending the way in which the criminal law operates to 
protect victims of journalistic practices that all who have appeared before the Inquiry have 
condemned, the reach of the criminal law should be reduced by importing a defence to all 
crime that was committed by a journalist acting in the public interest.23 The example most 
often given is the story published initially by the Daily Telegraph, which exposed the way in 
which the expenses system for Members of Parliament had been abused and, in particular, 
the fact that the Daily Telegraph paid a large sum of money to someone for a disc of all MPs’ 
expenses which, it is said, must have been provided, at the very least, in breach of confidence. 
The evidence of the then editor, Will Lewis, was that advice was sought at every stage and 
very great care was taken to ensure that what the Daily Telegraph did was not in breach of the 
criminal law24 but I recognise that, were that situation to recur today, questions about breach

of the Bribery Act 2010 could be more difficult to resolve. A more recent example related to 
the bribery of a court official to remove driving offences from the court record which was 
exposed in The Sun.25

The argument is that no journalist should be put in peril of being guilty of crime when he 
or she is pursuing a story, the publication of which will be in the public interest. The vital 
significance of the role of the press in holding power to account (and by publishing stories 
that uncover misconduct about which the public is entitled to know) can only be encouraged 
by complete protection from the risk of criminal prosecution; there is otherwise insufficient 
protection for such a journalist who should not have to weigh up the personal risk of criminal 
prosecution when deciding whether or not to proceed. The importance of the principle is 
further underlined by the fact that journalists have been prepared to take that risk (particularly 
in relation to the unwillingness to disclose sources) and that their position has been reflected 
and recognised (albeit couched with an appropriate exception) by Article 10 of the ECHR in 
terms that:

“No court may require a person to disclose nor is any person guilty of contempt of 
court  for  refusing  to  disclose  the  source  of  information  contained  in  a  publication 
for which he is responsible unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court 
that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice, or national security or for the 
prevention of disorder or crime.”

This suggestion is far from being a simple extension of the present or proposed defence to a 
contravention of s55 of the DPA. Given the different ways (representing different points in the 
chronology) in which such an offence can be committed, to be effective, the test would have 
to be satisfied at each stage. Thus, using the present law, it might be possible to procure or 
obtain personal data on the basis that there is an objectively justifiable basis for concluding 
that to do so is in the public interest. Disclosing that personal data raises potentially different 
issues. Take as an example the possibility that a journalist has information that there is a 
link  between  a  public  official  (whose  private  life  is  of  no  public  interest)  and  an  exposed 
corrupt agent and that the latter is improperly influencing the former in the performance of 
his duties. The journalist deceptively obtains details of the telephone records of the public 
official, discovers that there is no such link but that it is obvious that the public official is having 
an extra-marital affair. There may be a public interest defence in procuring or obtaining the 
data in the first place but there is hardly any public interest in then disclosing what has, in 
fact, been discovered (as opposed to what it was thought, in fact wrongly, might have been 
discovered).

Other criminal offences, however, are not based around the protection of data but rather bite 
at the moment of commission. Assume the same example as above but that the only way to 
obtain the evidence of a connection was by bribing (or blackmailing) an employee to provide 
the  information,  and  that  doing  so  produced  not  the  evidence  of  a  corrupt  relationship 
but evidence of the extra-marital affair. With that evidence obtained, subject to potential 
arguments of privacy in the civil law (which an editor may well be prepared to argue), there 
would be nothing to prevent the journalist from publishing the story of the affair.

On the face of it, many journalists might argue that this is entirely justifiable. A story (albeit not 
the story sought) has been lawfully obtained and there is no reason based upon its manner 
of acquisition why it should not be put into the public domain. What it depends on, however, 
is the information of a link between the official and the corrupt agent. Assuming that the 
story  emerged,  how  could  the  proposed  defence  to  an  allegation  of  bribery  or  blackmail 

25 Details contained in the judgment of the Court of Appeal [2012] EWCA Crim 1243

1490

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJever be tested? The journalist will say (whether honestly or not) that the information came 
from a reliable source, responsible in the past for much entirely accurate material, whom he 
is not prepared to name under any circumstances. The effect of a defence in law will be to 
emasculate almost all prospect of bringing a journalist to task for the way in which a story has 
been researched, whatever means, at first blush illegal, might have been used.

6.7 

Neither is a criminal defence necessary. It might be thought that it is only right that both editors 
and journalists should think long and hard before embarking on what is criminal conduct in 
an effort to pursue a story and that it should not be sufficient to rely on an undisclosed source 
or sources as an all embracing defence. There are, however, other mechanisms to ensure that 
the law is not brought to bear on journalists (or, indeed, on any one else) in an oppressive or 
unfair way.

7.	 Public	interest:	the	decision	to	prosecute
7.1 

There are a number of mechanisms in place to prevent or inhibit the prosecution of crime 
which might be described (in non-technical language) as abusive. These revolve around the 
decision of the prosecutor to prosecute; the control that any criminal court exercises over 
abuse of its process; the ‘rights’ of the jury; and the ultimate discretion of a sentencing judge. 
It is worth discussing each of these in turn.

7.2  Whatever  might  have  been  the  position  previously,  in  recent  times  the  decision  of  the 
prosecutor to prosecute has always involved the exercise of discretion. On 29 January 1951, 
the  then  Attorney  General,  Sir  Hartley  Shawcross  QC,  made  a  statement  to  the  House  of 
Commons which has been frequently since repeated and adopted by subsequent Attorneys 
General. He said:26

“It has never been the rule in this country – I hope it never will be – that suspected 
criminal offences must automatically be the subject of prosecution.”

7.3 

Until this Inquiry, the manifestation of this discretion was only contained within the Code for 
Crown Prosecutors, which not only prescribes an evidential test (whether there is sufficient 
evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each suspect on each charge) 
but also a public interest test which is articulated in this way:27

“A prosecution will usually take place unless the prosecutor is sure that there are public 
interest factors tending against prosecution which outweigh those tending in favour, 
or unless the prosecutor is satisfied that the public interest may be properly served, 
in the first instance, by offering the offender the opportunity to have the matter dealt 
with by an out-of-court disposal (see section 7). The more serious the offence or the 
offender’s record of criminal behaviour, the more likely it is that a prosecution will be 
required in the public interest.
Assessing  the  public  interest  is  not  simply  a  matter  of  adding  up  the  number  of 
factors on each side and seeing which side has the greater number. Each case must 
be considered on its own facts and on its own merits. Prosecutors must decide the 
importance of each public interest factor in the circumstances of each case and go 
on  to  make  an  overall  assessment.  It  is  quite  possible  that  one  factor  alone  may 
outweigh a number of other factors which tend in the opposite direction. Although

Chapter 2 | The Criminal Law J7.4 

7.5 

7.6 

there may be public interest factors tending against prosecution in a particular case, 
prosecutors should consider whether nonetheless a prosecution should go ahead and 
for those factors to be put to the court for consideration when sentence is passed.”

Not least because of the expressed concern relating to journalists, the Inquiry raised the issue 
with the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC (DPP) and, seeking an analysis of 
the position, also invited him to consider whether it was appropriate to enunciate a policy in 
relation to the public interest in the prosecution of journalists.28 His statement recognised the 
considerable public concern about the allegedly criminal activities of some journalists and 
saw no difficulty in developing a bespoke policy to give guidance to staff as to the approach 
to such difficult cases. Thereafter, on 18 April 2012, he published interim guidelines (on which 
he commenced a consultation exercise) on assessing the public interest in cases affecting 
the media. He distinguished between the public interest served by freedom of expression 
and  the  right  to  receive  and  impart  information  and  the  separate  question  of  whether  a 
prosecution is in the public interest (being the second stage of the Code test).

That process of consultation concluded and, on 13 September 2012, the DPP issued formal 
Guidelines.29 Having reviewed the general principles relating to prosecution, the Guidelines 
refer to principles of special application in cases affecting the media by reference to Article 
10 of the ECHR and decisions such as Sunday Times v UK (No 2)30 in addition to the further 
guidance to be derived from R v Shayler31 and AG’s Reference No 3 of 2003.32 The Guidelines 
then identify that the appropriate approach is encapsulated by the question whether the 
public interest served by the conduct in question outweighs the overall criminality.

There is then an outline of the way in which prosecutors should deal with the question by 
following  a  three  stage  process:  that  is  to  say  (1)  assessing  the  public  interest  served  by 
the  conduct  in  question;  (2)  assessing  the  overall  criminality;  and  (3)  weighing  these  two 
considerations. In relation to the public interest served by freedom of expression and the 
right to receive and impart information (not previously defined in law), examples of conduct 
capable of serving the public interest are provided which are not intended to be exhaustive 
but which include the following:

“(a) Conduct  which  is  capable  of  disclosing  that  a  criminal  offence  has  been 

committed, is being committed, or is likely to be committed.

(b) Conduct which is capable of disclosing that a person has failed, is failing, or is 

likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which s/he is subject.

(c)  Conduct  which  is  capable  of  disclosing  that  a  miscarriage  of  justice  has 

occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur.

(d) Conduct which is capable of raising or contributing to an important matter of 
public debate (of which there is no exhaustive definition but examples include 
public  debate  about  serious  impropriety,  significant  unethical  conduct  and 
significant incompetence which affects the public).

(e) Conduct which is capable of disclosing that anything falling within any one of 

the above is being, or is likely to be, deliberately concealed.”

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ7.7 

As to the assessment of overall criminality, the Guidelines require prosecutors to focus on 
the conduct in question, the extent of the wrong-doing and the harm caused. They gave as 
non-exhaustive examples:

“(a) The  impact  on  the  victim(s)  of  the  conduct  in  question,  including  the 

consequences for the victim(s).

(b) Whether the victim was under 18 or in a vulnerable position.
(c)  The overall loss and damage caused by the conduct in question
(d) Whether the conduct was part of a repeated or routine pattern of behaviour 

of likely to continue.

(e) Whether there was any element of corruption in the conduct in question.
(f)  Whether the conduct in question included the use of threats, harassment or 

intimidation.

(g) The  impact  on  any  course  of  justice,  for  example  whether  a  criminal 

investigation or proceedings may have been put in jeopardy.

(h) The motivation of the suspect insofar as it can be ascertained (examples might 
range from malice or financial gain at one extreme to a belief that the conduct 
would be in the public interest at the other taking into account the information 
available to the suspect at the time).

(i)  Whether the public interest in question could equally well have been served 
by some lawful means having regard to all the circumstances in the particular 
case.”

7.8 

The Guidelines go on to make the point that the impact on the victim(s) of the conduct in 
question is of considerable importance33 and the fact that invasions of privacy can be keenly 
felt and can cause considerable distress to victims (although “regard must be given to the level 
of the seriousness of the invasion, whether on the facts there was a reasonable expectation 
of  privacy  and  whether  the  conduct  in  question  was  proportionate  to  the  public  interest 
claimed to be served”). As for the decision, the Guidelines go on to make two further, very 
important, points. These are:

“37.  Prosecutors are reminded that assessing whether a prosecution is required in 
the public interest is not an arithmetical exercise involving the addition of the number 
of factors on each side and then making a decision according to which side has the 
greater number. Rather, each case must be considered on its own facts and its own 
merits. It is quite possible that one factor alone may outweigh a number of other 
factors  which  tend  in  the  opposite  direction.  Even  where  there  may  be  a  number 
of  public  interest  factors  which  tend  against  prosecution  in  a  particular  case,  the 
prosecutor should consider whether the case should go ahead but with those factors 
being drawn to the court’s attention so that they can be duly considered by the court.
38.  Prosecutors  should  take  special  care  in  cases  which  involve  the  disclosure  of 
journalists’ sources. In approaching such cases, prosecutors are reminded that the 
European Court of Human Rights has indicated that: 34

“Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions of press freedom 
…  Without  such  protection,  sources  may  be  deterred  from  assisting  the  press 
in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public

1493

Chapter 2 | The Criminal Law Jwatchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to 
provide  accurate  and  reliable  information  may  be  adversely  affected.  Having 
regard  to  the  importance  of  the  protection  of  journalistic  sources  for  press 
freedom in a democratic society and the potentially chilling effect of an order of 
source disclosure has on the exercise of that freedom, such a measure cannot be 
compatible with Article 10 of the Convention unless it is justified by an overriding 
requirement in the public interest.”

7.9  When the DPP was giving evidence, it was made clear that it was not for me or for the Inquiry 
to enunciate a prosecutions policy and, further, that it was a matter for him to determine 
whether or not he wished to.35 However, it is clearly important that he has chosen to accept 
the invitation proffered to him and now gone so far, after consultation, as to issue formal and 
thus definitive Guidelines.

It is right to pay tribute to this contribution to the criminal justice system, which provides clarity 
to the circumstances in which a prosecution might be considered appropriate (and would 
obviously have excluded any prosecution should one have been considered in relation to the 
disclosure of MPs’ expenses). It is beyond doubt that journalists would  prefer guarantees 
and immunity but, put simply, that would be unjustified and would do nothing to ensure 
that appropriate standards of behaviour were set, encouraged, supported and enforced, not 
merely as a matter of criminal law but also editorial practice.

process
Three other protective mechanisms are available for journalists, each of which can be described 
shortly.  First,  although  the  court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  interfere  with  the  exercise  by  the 
prosecution of its discretion to prosecute,36 it can offer advice to the prosecutor and require 
instructions to be taken from the prosecuting authority before permitting the prosecution to 
commence. Furthermore, the court can stay a prosecution as an abuse of the process of the 
court, either because it represents an abuse of executive power37 or in circumstances which 
amounted to an ‘affront to the public conscience’;38 ‘so great an affront to the integrity of 
the justice system and therefore the rule of law that the associated prosecution was thereby 
rendered abusive and ought not to be countenanced by the court’ is also sufficient.39 It is 
not necessary to seek to define how these principles might be applied to the prosecution of 
a journalist; given the proposed guidelines on prosecution, it is extremely unlikely they will 
ever arise, but there should be little doubt that the circumstances will be obvious if they did.

The second protective mechanism must be mentioned as a matter of constitutional reality. 
There  are  examples,  littered  throughout  history,  in  which  juries  are  properly  directed  as 
to the law and, in particular, the ingredients of a specific offence, who then take the view 
that, irrespective of the law, they are not prepared to convict for what they perceive to be 
good reasons. The best (and oft-cited) example is the acquittal of Clive Ponting, a senior civil 
servant, of offences contrary to s2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, following his disclosure 
to Tam Dalyell MP of documents relating to the sinking of the General Belgrano during the

Falklands  War  in  1982.  No  reliance  could  be  placed  on  the  prospect  of  a  jury  taking  this 
course in relation to a journalist but no analysis of the position would be accurate without it 
being mentioned.

The third protective mechanism is, in one sense, the ultimate safeguard. Although (in the 
absence of abuse of process) the court cannot prevent a prosecution from being pursued and 
will conduct the trial entirely in accordance with the law, should a journalist be convicted, a 
very substantial discretion vests in the judge when it comes to sentence.40 Even in those cases 
governed by guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council (which every court ‘must follow’), 
the ultimate discretion is preserved by the words ‘unless the court is satisfied that it would be 
contrary to the interests of justice to do so’: see s125(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.

Thus, if a prosecution has been pursued which the judge concludes did not correctly balance 
the extent to which the public interest served by the conduct in question outweighed the 
overall criminality, it is open to him or her to reflect that fact in the sentence passed. At one 
end of the spectrum is an order of absolute discharge, prescribed by s12(1) of the Powers of 
Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 in these terms:

“Where a court is of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances including the 
nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict 
punishment, the court may make an order discharging him absolutely.”

The effect of such an order is that the conviction is “deemed not to be a conviction for any 
purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made” and “shall be 
disregarded for the purposes of any enactment which imposes … or requires the imposition of 
any … disqualification or disability” on the convicted person: see s14(1) and (3) of the 2000 
Act.

The argument that has been advanced is that, by this stage, the journalist has had to undergo 
the indignity of prosecution and trial and that the decision of the judge that it is inexpedient to 
inflict punishment, doubtless because of the view that the judge takes of the prosecution, is of 
little comfort. This is a form of special pleading. The fact is that the journalist will have chosen 
deliberately to break the law in pursuit of a story. That should not be an everyday occurrence 
and it should be common place that no such decision is taken without the authority of the 
newspaper which employs him or her and then only following a careful consideration of the 
material that justifies it. If the journalist is freelance, it will be extremely wise for any such 
decision to be documented and the evidence base for it made clear.

In those circumstances, the decision of an independent prosecutor should not be feared or 
considered an unnecessary interference with the freedom of the press: it is a check on the 
exercise of that freedom which ensures that it is not being abused. There are then potential 
checks on the prosecutor’s decision, ultimately, by the court should a prosecution ensue and 
reach  the  stage  of  sentence.  Provided  appropriate  attention  is  paid  to  the  importance  of 
a  free press and  the  duty  of  the press to  hold  power to  account, there is  no  reason  why 
journalists should not be subject to exactly the same checks and balances that every other 
member of society has to endure should they seek to exercise some right or privilege.

40 The exception is, of course, where the penalty is fixed by law: effectively, this only applies in relation to murder

In the circumstances, save in relation to the modification of the defence and the increase 
in the maximum penalty for an offence under s55 of the Data Protection Act 1988 (which 
requires  an  order  from  the  Secretary  of  State  implementing  the  provisions  of  s77-78  of 
the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008),41 I do not recommend that any change is 
necessary to the substantive criminal law.

On	the	basis	that	the	provisions	of	s77-78	of	the	Criminal	Justice	and	Immigration	
Act	2008	are	brought	into	effect,	so	that	increased	sentencing	powers	are	available	
for	breaches	of	s55	of	the	Data	Protection	Act	1998,	I	also	recommend	that	the	
Secretary	of	State	for	Justice	use	the	power	vested	in	him	by	s124(1)(a)(i)	of	the	
Coroners	 and	 Justice	 Act	 2009	 to	 invite	 the	 Sentencing	 Council	 of	 England	 and	
Wales	 to	 prepare	 guidelines	 in	 relation	 to	 data	 protection	 offences	 (including	
computer	misuse).	With	the	new	statutory	maximum	and	the	lack	of	precedent,	
it	is	important	that	courts	recognise	the	gravity	of	this	type	of	offending	and	are	
also	provided	with	guidance	regarding	the	implications	should	circumstances	arise	
when	it	becomes	necessary	to	consider	the	commission	of	this	type	of	offence	by	
a	journalist.

9.2 

9.3 

The value of involving the Sentencing Council is obvious. Before producing a guideline, the 
Council is required to consult on a draft and include within that consultation process “such 
other persons as the Council considers appropriate”:42 only then is a guideline promulgated. It 
is inconceivable that the Council would not consider it appropriate to consult the Information 
Commissioner, the media and any other interested parties on the appropriate categories of 
the offence, the range of sentence for each category and both the aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances.

Turning  to  the  procedural  criminal  law,  in  submissions  concerned  with  recommendations 
for a new more effective policy and the future conduct of relations between the police and 
the press, the Deputy Commissioner, Craig Mackey, has identified three issues of particular 
significance. Each of these is concerned with the operation of the PACE. The first concerns 
what he describes as the ‘camouflage of apparent co-operation,’ which itself can defeat an 
application for a production order because of the requirement in the access conditions, set out 
in para 2(b) of Schedule 1 to PACE, that ‘other methods’ of obtaining the material have failed 
or have not been tried because it appeared that they were bound to fail. The second relates 
to the extreme difficulty of obtaining journalistic material by means of a production order. 
The third concerns the absence of a statutory exclusion from journalistic material of items 
held with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose: that situation is to be contrasted 
with the fact that ‘criminal purpose’ material is excluded from legal professional privilege by 
s10(2) of PACE. I shall deal with them in turn.

9.4 

As  to  the  first  proposition,  DC  Mackey  points  to  the  evidence  of  non-cooperation  that 
surrounded the attempt to search the NoTW building and what he described as ‘the veneer 
of apparent co-operation’ which followed.43 On that basis, it is argued that the police would 
not be able to satisfy the access conditions contained in para 2(b) because the company and 
its solicitors would always be able to point to assertions of willingness to assist, whatever was 
happening in fact. He submits that para 2(b) should simply be repealed.

41 This recommendation is dealt with at length in Part H, Chapter 5
42 s120(6)(d) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009
43 Part E, Chapter 5

1496

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ9.5 

9.6 

9.7 

This proposition contains within it a far reaching challenge to the checks and balances that are 
built into PACE and, for my part, I am not convinced that it would be appropriate to infer from 
this particular investigation a wider problem concerning obtaining material in circumstances 
such as obtained here: even if that is the case, it is not evidenced.

The second concern relates to the definition of journalistic material. The phrase is defined 
by s13(2) PACE as ‘in the possession of a person who acquired or created it for the purposes 
of journalism’. That phrase – the purposes of journalism – is not defined in the Act but has 
been given a narrow meaning in the context of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.44 I see 
no reason why there should be a different construction of the phrase in the context of PACE.

The  third  concern  relates  to  the  question  whether  journalistic  material  continues  to  fall 
within the scope of excluded material (so as to fall within the scope of the second set of 
access conditions in Schedule 1 of PACE) if it has been created or acquired in furtherance of 
a crime. Mr Mackey poses the question: if there was iniquity such as crime or fraud did the 
duty of confidence ever arise? If not, then the journalistic material will not be held under an 
undertaking, restriction or obligation of confidence as required by s11(3) of PACE.

9.8  Mr Mackey’s submission is advanced in this way:45

“The concept of confidentiality is subject to limiting principles, one of which is that 
the  public  interest  in  protecting  confidences  may  be  outweighed  by  some  other 
countervailing public interest which favours disclosure, such as that a person cannot 
be the confidant of a crime or fraud (see Lord Goff in AG v. Guardian Newspapers 
(No. 2) [1990] 1 AC 109 at 282-3). However, the case law concerning the ’defence of 
iniquity’ deals with whether a contractual duty of confidence can be enforced (see 
e.g. Gartside v. Outram (1857) 26 LJ Ch (NS) 113, Initial Services v. Putterill [1968] QB 
396, at 410). There is no direct authority on whether confidentiality under the PACE 
statutory decision still applies, where it is in the context of criminal behaviour.
A caveat was expressly introduced into s10(2) of PACE, dealing with legal professional 
privilege  [to  the  effect  that  Items  held  with  the  intention  of  furthering  a  criminal 
purpose  are  not  items  subject  to  legal  privilege].  However,  no  such  caveat  was 
introduced into sll of PACE dealing with journalistic material held in confidence.”

9.9 

The point is then made that similar provisions to Schedule 1 PACE are contained in Schedule 5 
of the Terrorism Act 2005, which uses the same definitions of ‘items subject to legal privilege’, 
‘excluded  material’  and  ‘special  procedure  material’  as  in  PACE.  A  simpler  set  of  access 
conditions provides grounds on which an application for a production order could be granted 
under  that  Act  even  in  relation  to  journalistic  material  (although  one  of  the  conditions  is 
that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  having  regard  to  the  benefit  likely  to  accrue  to  a  terrorist 
investigation if the material is obtained).46 The submission goes on (at para 3.6):

44 Sugar v British Broadcasting Corporation [2012] UKSC 4 per Lord Phillips (at para 67) “Information should only be 
found to be held for the purposes of journalism ... if an immediate object of holding the information is to use it for 
one of those purposes”; Lord Walker (at para. 84) “The question whether information is held for the purposes of 
journalism should thus be considered in a relatively narrow rather than a relatively wide way”; Lord Brown (at par 106) 
that “the central question to be asked ... will be ... whether there remains any sufficiently direct link between the BBC’s 
continuing holding of the information and the achievement of its journalistic purposes”. See also para 6.4 of the Annex 
of Legal Framework

1497

Chapter 2 | The Criminal Law J“Parliament has therefore expressly allowed applications  to be made for excluded 
material (including journalistic material obtained in confidence) in terrorism cases, 
and added a ’public interest’ condition (similar to paragraph 2(c) of Sch.1 to PACE) 
under  which  the  court  can  take  into  account,  amongst  other  factors,  whether  the 
journalist or media corporation was involved in any criminal activity. Yet Parliament 
did not include any such provisions in PACE. It is arguable, therefore, that Parliament 
did not intend the courts to override the PACE definition of journalistic material held 
in confidence simply by saying it is not held in confidence where it is not in the public 
interest.”

9.10 

It  is  certainly  remarkable  that  Parliament  might  have  provided  greater  protection  for 
journalistic  material  than  in  relation  to  legal  professional  privilege  as  a  matter  of  general 
law. Even more so that it would provide less protection for the material where the public 
interest is served in relation to a terrorist investigation than might be the case if that material 
has been created or acquired in furtherance of crime. Although the circumstances in which 
the provision might bite will hopefully be very rare, I see force in the submission that s11(3) 
PACE should be amended by providing that journalistic material is only held in confidence for 
the PACE provisions if it is held, or has continuously been held since it was first acquired or 
created, subject to an enforceable or lawful undertaking, restriction or obligation.47

9.11 

I am very conscious that I have received submissions only from the MPS on this topic and 
that there is potential room for argument that any amendment to PACE will have far wider 
ramifications of which I have not been apprised and go beyond the limited goals that DC 
Mackey  seeks  to  achieve.  Before  any  conclusion  can  be  reached  on  any  of  these  issues, 
appropriate consultation will be essential.

In	the	circumstances,	without	pre-judging	any	conclusion,	I	recommend	that	the	
Home	Office	should	consider	and,	if	necessary,	consult	upon	(a)	whether	paragraph	
2(b)	of	Schedule	1	to	the	Police	and	Criminal	Evidence	Act	1984	should	be	repealed;	
(b)	whether	PACE	should	be	amended	to	provide	a	definition	of	the	phrase	“for	
the	purposes	of	journalism”	in	s13(2);	and	(c)	whether	s11(3)	of	PACE	should	be	
amended	by	providing	that	journalistic	material	is	only	held	in	confidence	for	the	
PACE	provisions	if	it	is	held	or	has	continuously	been	held	since	it	was	first	acquired	
or	created	subject	to	an	enforceable	or	lawful	undertaking,	restriction	or	obligation.

47 I do not ignore the considerations that flow from Article 10 of the ECHR and s. 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 
(as to which there is no material difference in principle: see Camelot Group plc v Centaur Communications [1999] QB 
124 at 138G per Thorpe LJ). The courts will continue to have to consider these provisions and carry out a balancing 
exercise in any case involving the press even if the material is neither journalistic material or excluded within the 
PACE definitions: a summary of the position can be found in Shiv Malik v Manchester Crown Court [2008] EWHC 1362

Introduction
Appendix 4 describes the current law and identifies the flexibility that has allowed the common 
law  to  develop  incrementally  and  in  keeping  with  social  developments  and  the  principles 
enunciated in general terms by the European Convention on Human Rights. How otherwise 
could the law seek to deal with concepts which have only emerged in recent years, such as the 
explosion of communication on the internet, blogs which have the same (or greater) reach 
as traditional newspapers and the social media such as Facebook? The line drawn between 
personal and public space has to be re-evaluated in the light of the challenges that have been 
posed and it would be foolish to expect that change will not continue so that the challenges 
of next year will be different yet again to those faced today.

A very good example of the way in which the law has had to re-evaluate its approach can 
be found in the developments relating to injunctive relief. Until the rise of the internet, with 
servers based out of the jurisdiction of the UK court but providing material to anyone with 
access  to  an  online  computer,  and  the  additional  changes  consequent  on  social  media,  if 
the court prohibited the publication of any material, whether based on privacy, confidence 
or in any other circumstances, the law of contempt (for breach of the injunction) operated 
to ensure compliance. Attempts to ensure sufficient secrecy to provide effective relief led to 
what became known as super-injunctions, which in turn led to other difficulties.1

This Chapter is not intended to repeat the analysis of the way in which the substantive law 
has developed but rather to deal with the problems facing those who seek to enforce their 
rights. It concerns the complexity of the process of civil law and the availability (or otherwise) 
of  funding  for  that  purpose.  Again,  it  is  not  intended  as  a  definitive  analysis  of  civil  law 
procedure;  it  is  to  provide  a  sufficient  landscape  of  the  problems  faced  by  claimants,  the 
dilemmas faced by defendants and the (perfectly legitimate) attempts of each to confront 
them. The present position of the substantive law will then briefly be considered.

2.	 Civil	proceedings:	the	present	risk	of	litigation
2.1 

For those without the experience, it might be thought an easy matter to start civil proceedings 
and, in some contexts, it is. In a myriad number of different circumstances, it is possible to do 
so on the internet. By way of example only, if a consumer wishes to pursue a retailer in relation 
to defective goods, if a tradesman wants to recover the amount that he is owed for work 
done and materials supplied, or if a landlord wants to commence proceedings for possession 
because of non payment of rent (or for other breaches of the tenancy), it is comparatively 
straightforward to access the court system and use a process called Money Claims On-line 
(MCOL) or Possession Claims On-line (PCOL) to do so. If the claim is not defended, obtaining 
a judgment is equally straightforward, although rather more is involved when it comes to 
enforcement.

judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-20052011.pdf

1499

J2.2 

It goes further. The system encourages self help because, in a large number of cases, there is 
no provision for public funding to assist those who wish to pursue remedies for breach of their 
contractual or other rights. Legal aid used to provide that assistance but, to a large extent, 
because of its cost, it is no longer available. Citizen Advice Bureaus will advise members of the 
public as to what they can do to enforce their rights (or resist attempts by others to pursue 
them);  other  organisations  in  the  third  sector  do  likewise.  How  that  should  happen,  who 
should do what, and how it is to be funded are part of the wide debate that surrounds access 
to justice.

2.3  Where a claim is disputed, it is allocated to the type of trial associated with its value and/or 
its complexity. For small claims, such as consumer disputes or debt up to £5,000, the case 
will almost invariably be heard in the county court using the small claims procedure that is 
available. This jurisdiction leads to a hearing that will be conducted by a District Judge on an 
informal basis; in most cases, either one or both parties will be unrepresented and will look 
to the judge to conduct the proceedings in such a way as respects the rights of both parties 
and apply the law (which, in this type of case, is usually but not invariably straightforward). 
The judge will reach a decision and so provide the parties with the resolution of their dispute.

2.4 

In the context of this Inquiry, this straightforward means of obtaining access to justice is of 
very limited assistance because actions in defamation can only be commenced in the High 
Court;2 it is unusual for such claims to be remitted to the county court and even more unlikely 
that they will ever be considered suitable for the small claims procedure. Quite apart from 
the specific provision in relation to defamation, however, the real problem is that there are 
a large number of types of claim that are too complicated for self help. Many (particularly 
in  the area of  media law) require legal help  and  even ingenuity to pursue.3 Lawyers then 
become essential. Those of sufficient personal wealth can afford to fund legal advice and 
representation.  Those  who  are  not,  cannot.  For  them  a  different  mechanism  to  provide 
access to justice was provided in the form of the conditional fee agreement (CFA). By this 
arrangement, solicitors can act for a client on the basis that they work on the principle “No 
Win, No Fee”. In other words, solicitors approached by a potential client without funds make 
an assessment of the prospects of success in the case: if they consider that the prospects 
are good enough, they could offer this type of agreement, knowing full well that the law will 
recognise the agreement and, should  their client succeed, allow them to obtain  an order 
that the defendant in the litigation obtain an uplift (up to 100%) of the actual costs incurred 
(which will have to have been agreed by the defendant or assessed by the court). This uplift 
represents  money  that  they  would  not  earn  from  a  fee-paying  client  but  is  intended  to 
compensate for those cases which they take on but lose, when they forgo all the costs that 
they have incurred.

2.5 

There  is  an  additional  complication.  Litigation  in  this  country  normally  operates  on  the 
principle that the winner recovers his or her costs from the loser. If, for example, a member 
of the public sues a newspaper and wins, he or she can expect that the newspaper is good for 
the money and can pay the costs that the court orders to be paid; if the solicitors are working 
on a CFA, this will include the uplift. On the other hand, should the newspaper win, an order 
for costs will equally be likely to follow against the member of the public who may not have

of the Act
3 A good example of this legal ingenuity provided one of the sparks that has generated this Inquiry. In an attempt to 
learn whether she had been a victim of phone hacking, in July 2009, Sienna Miller issued proceedings against the MPS 
seeking disclosure of any material in its possession that provided evidence that she could use to deploy against NI: 
see http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Witness-Statement-of-Sienna-Miller.pdf. Her 
lawyers placed reliance on the decision in Norwich Pharmacal Co v. Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] AC 133, 
obtained the order and the evidence. Many others have since followed suit.

access to money and whose home or other assets would be at risk. To address that problem, 
the concept of after the event insurance (ATE) was introduced.

Everybody understands the protection that insurance provides. In the usual case, a premium 
is  paid  on  the  basis  that  if  the  insured  event  arises  during  the  period  of  the  insurance,  a 
specified  sum  will  be  paid.  Life  insurance  operates  on  the  basis  that  an  identified  lump 
sum will be paid during the currency of the contract if the person who is the subject of the 
insurance dies. Travel insurance can insure against the risk of cancellation, baggage being 
lost in transit, medical expenses being incurred or a host of other risks. ATE is different. The 
event has occurred before the insurance is taken out. This insurance, however, is to cover the 
risk of failure of the litigation that arises out of the event. The premium is calculated by the 
underwriters, based on the risk that the litigation will fail and the amount at risk (the costs 
that would be ordered to be paid to the winning side) for which insurance is sought.

ATE insurance has another benefit. As the law presently stands (although this is about to 
change), the premium itself is fully recoverable as part of the costs of the action so that if the 
beneficiary of the policy succeeds, not only are the solicitors’ costs (including the uplift of up 
to 100%) recovered but the premium for the ATE insurance is also recoverable. Furthermore, 
the premium can itself be conditional, in which circumstance it will only be payable if the 
action  itself  succeeds.  On  that  basis,  if  the  action  fails  so  that  the  providers  of  the  ATE 
insurance have to meet costs up to the insured limit, the solicitors will not recover their costs 
and the ATE insurers will not recover the premium (notwithstanding that they have had to 
pay out on the insurance). All this comes at a cost. Insurers will calculate the premium at an 
appropriate level so that recoveries in the successful cases compensate the loss of premium 
(and the costs paid) in the unsuccessful proceedings. It will be no surprise, therefore, that 
premiums have been high.

The consequence has been a massive increase in the costs of litigation for defendants who 
lose and, thus, the cost of premiums for employers insuring against employees and public 
liability claims for those requiring road traffic insurance and many others. It has also increased 
the cost for those who self-insure, in which group newspaper titles are likely to be included. 
It resulted in lobbying the Government to change the rules, not only generally but specifically 
in relation to defamation. As a result, the Ministry of Justice issued a consultation paper on 
“Controlling  costs  in  defamation  proceedings”;4  having  reviewed  the  responses  it  decided 
to invite the Civil Procedure Rule Committee (CPRC) to consider draft rules to implement a 
number of measures to control costs in publication proceedings.

As  a  result,  amendments  to  the  Civil  Procedure  Rules  and  associated  directions  were 
introduced in all civil proceedings. The first change was to require notice of ATE insurance 
to be given to the other party with the letter before claim or within seven days of taking out 
insurance. Second, additional information was required to be given as to whether premiums 
are staged and, if so, the stage at which increased premiums become payable along with 
the level of insurance cover. Furthermore, in relation to publication proceedings only, the 
Rules introduced a period during which, if the defendant admitted liability and made an offer 
leading to a settlement, the defendant would not be liable for the ATE insurance premium.5

2.10  Running  parallel  with  these  changes,  however,  there  was  significant  concern  about  costs 
generally  so  that  a  far  wider  scale  review  was  undertaken  by  Lord  Justice  Jackson.  He

related proceedings (such as privacy) which generally involved the media that the topics were 
considered separately. Jackson LJ started by making the point that the monetary return by 
way of damages in actions of this type may not be substantial7 but that a claimant could attach 
great value to winning his claim because the judgment itself will provide vindication. This is 
an important point for two reasons. First, it emphasises the social objective of providing a 
mechanism for protection of reputation and personal privacy which is not easily protected 
simply by money. Second, it underlines that it would not be appropriate to require the same 
degree of proportionality in relation to costs as, for example, in a commercial dispute.

2.11  Another  aspect  of  this  type  of  litigation  concerns  what  both  claimants  and  defendants 
describe as aggressive litigating. Representatives of the press point to the observations of 
Lord Hoffmann in Campbell v MGN Ltd8 referring to “the conduct of the case by the claimant’s 
solicitors in a way which not only runs up substantial costs but requires the defendants to do 
so as well”, so that with the risk of a success fee “the defendant is faced with an arms race 
which makes it particularly unfair for the claimant afterwards to justify his conduct of the 
litigation on the ground that the defendant’s own costs were equally high”. Paul Dacre made a 
similar point, criticising lawyers for running “relatively straight-forward” cases on CFAs for “as 
long as possible”9 although, as Jackson LJ observes, if “relatively straight-forward” means that 
the claimant is bound to win, the change in the rules will assist by accruing cost benefit to 
early admission. Jackson LJ also noted that three claimant firms laid the blame at the door of 
media defendants effectively (and positively asserted by one) for dragging litigation out. This 
has some echo in the evidence heard by the Inquiry regarding what has been described as 
defensive attack.10 In the context of this issue, however, it does not matter who is responsible.

2.12 

Jackson LJ produced a final report in December 200911 and again returned to defamation 
and related claims. He noted the argument that libel law imposed excessive restrictions on 
free speech, with the further point advanced in an opinion of Lord Pannick QC and Anthony 
Hudson that the present system of costs recovery imposed a disproportionate regime such 
that  it  “cannot  be  convincingly  be  established  that  it  is  necessary  and  proportionate  to  a 
legitimate aim” rendering compliance with Article 10 of the ECHR arguable.12 The first point 
was countered by the submission that it is always open to publish on the basis of what can be 
proved to be true and that there is no public interest in misinformation. While accepting that

7 Jackson LJ noted the ‘notional’ ceiling on general damages awarded in defamation in the region of £215,000 to 
£250,000 (see Gur v. Avrupa Newspaper Ltd [2008] EWCA Civ 594; Tierney v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2006] EWHC 
3275 para 10. In the final report he explained that the reason for this apparent limit is that “it is abhorrent if a claimant 
with serious personal injuries is treated less generously by the courts than a defamation claimant who (although 
distressed) remains fit and well”

12 This argument subsequently prevailed in the European Court of Human Rights following further litigation relating to 
Naomi Campbell when the Court ruled that the recovery of success fees at the level sought by lawyers in privacy and 
defamation cases represents a significant violation of freedom of expression. In that case, the figures were startling: 
Ms Campbell was awarded £3,500 in damages after the House of Lords ruled her right to privacy had been breached 
by a front-page story revealing her attendance at Narcotics Anonymous. Her legal costs came to more than £1m, 
including £288,468 base costs, £279,981.35 in success fees and £26,020 disbursements: see MGN v. United Kingdom 
(Application 39401/04)

1502

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJsuccess fees and ATE premiums should cease to be recoverable, Jackson LJ was concerned to 
put other measures in place to ensure access to justice for claimants.

2.13  The special measures that he recommended were an increase in the general level of damages 
for defamation and breach of privacy by 10% (in line with his recommendation in relation to 
damages for personal injuries) with effect from the date that CFA success fees cease to be 
recoverable. The second is that the success fee (in the future to be paid by the claimant out of 
damages rather than the defendant) would be subject to negotiation but “x% of base costs, 
subject to a cap, the cap being y% of damages”. He goes on to observe:13

“The claimants in these cases (unlike personal injury claimants) do not need to devote 
any part of their damages to future care. Their main remedy … is vindication by the 
judgment  of  the  court  or  the  statement  in  court  after  settlement.  I  see  no  reason 
why such claimants should not be prepared to pay a substantial proportion of the 
damages to their lawyers as success fees.”

2.14  The principal recommendation concerned the mechanism for achieving the intended social 
objective of protecting claimants from adverse costs orders, on the basis that the paradigm 
libel case concerns an individual of moderate means and a well resourced media organisation. 
Jackson LJ therefore suggested qualified one way costs shifting for defamation and privacy 
cases, as similarly proposed for personal injury and judicial review so that the new provision 
of the Civil Procedure Rules (which would not require primary legislation) should provide:

“Costs ordered against the claimant in any claim for defamation or breach of privacy 
shall not exceed the amount (if any) which is a reasonable one for him to pay having 
regard to all the circumstances including:
the financial resources of all parties to the proceedings; and
their conduct in connection with the dispute to which the proceedings relate.”

2.15  The broad recommendations made by Jackson LJ were accepted by the Government but the 
concept of qualified one way costs shifting in relation to defamation and breach of privacy 
has not, as yet, been adopted. Before elaborating on the effect of that, it is necessary to 
identify the changes that have been made by legislation contained within Part 2 of the Legal 
Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.

2.16  As enacted, s44 of the Act (amending s58 and s58A of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, 
which concerns the regulation of CFAs and the recoverability of success fees) will mean that a 
success fee under a CFA will no longer be recovered from a losing party although, subject to 
further regulation as to calculation and as to cap, the lawyers conducting proceedings under 
a CFA will be able to recover the fee from a client. Save in circumstances irrelevant to the 
type of litigation connected to the press, s46 of the Act abolishes the right to recover the ATE 
insurance premium.

2.17  These provisions (due to come into force on 1 April 2013) undoubtedly remove the concern 
expressed by the European Court of Human Rights in MGN v United Kingdom. They will also 
dramatically  affect  the  balance  of  the  relationship  between  those  who  wish  to  complain 
about press conduct and the press.

Chapter 3 | The Civil LawJ3.	 Litigation	against	the	press
3.1 

In order to understand the true impact of these changes to the law, it is necessary to go back 
in time to the period when legal aid (that is to say, state support) was available to fund civil 
litigation. This was subject to the means of the applicant and sufficiently authoritative legal 
advice that there was a more than 50% prospect of success or, to put the test another way, 
that advice would be given to a man of moderate means that the prospects of success were 
sufficiently good to justify the costs risks of undertaking the litigation. For millions of people, 
legal aid was a lifeline and permitted access to justice for those who could never otherwise 
have afforded to pursue a remedy for breach of their rights. The further, additional, benefit 
of legal aid was that it acted as a shield as well as a sword.

3.2 

3.3 

3.4 

3.5 

Thus, not only did legal aid fund the legal costs of the assisted person, but (save in certain 
limited cases) it prevented the court from making an adverse order for costs against that 
assisted person should he or she lose the case. In other words, for those whose means were 
such that they were not required to make any contribution to their own legal costs, a successful 
defendant  would  be  unable  to  recover  its  costs.  In  the  main,  this  impacted  on  insurance 
companies but the consequences were well known and built into the risk assessment and, 
doubtless, the premium.

In the same way that there was an exception to the way in which proceedings in defamation 
could  be  commenced,  there  was  a  further  exception  in  relation  to  legal  aid:  put  simply, 
whatever the means of the individual, legal aid was simply not available to pursue litigation 
based  on  the  torts  of  libel  and  slander.  This  was  before  the  days  when  CFA  agreements 
were lawful, with the result that only the very rich or, at least, those who could afford or 
were prepared to take the risk of a substantial costs liability of losing an action were able 
to litigate. Power was very much in the hands of the press who (by way of comparison with 
most potential litigants) were well able to afford to litigate; they had in-house lawyers who 
were very familiar with the law and more than capable of advancing the case of the relevant 
title forcefully and with authority. Except where a litigant was so wealthy that the risk was 
simply not a factor, that power was real and must have caused very many who felt aggrieved 
(whether justifiably or not) by defamatory statements to refrain from seeking to pursue any 
remedy.

In the same context, it must be borne in mind that even if a claim succeeded, damages for 
defamation were large (usually then determined by a jury); it depended on what view the 
particular (inevitably inexperienced) jury took of the defamatory statement. In most cases, 
slander (or spoken defamation) required proof of actual financial damage although in libel 
(written or broadcast defamation), no financial damage is required. Thus, although a very 
substantial sum might be awarded as damages, it was by no means guaranteed.

CFAs changed the landscape entirely. Then, all who felt aggrieved at the way in which they 
had been treated by the press could seek legal advice and the operation of the libel laws (with 
the defendant having to prove the defence of justification or the circumstances of qualified 
privilege)  created  a  climate  in  which  redress  was  far  more  likely  to  be  attainable  and  the 
power which had been with the press now moved to those who wished to sue. If a lawyer was 
sufficiently confident of the claim, proceedings could be threatened and then commenced on 
a CFA and the risk to the defendant was enormous. However modest any damages might be, 
the potential costs bill if the claimant succeeded, increased by 100% for the success fee and 
then further increased by the cost of the ATE insurance premium, was potentially prohibitive. 
The press felt driven to settle not only because the editor was prepared to accept that a 
mistake had been made or did not feel confident about the story that had been written but 

1504

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ3.6 

3.7 

3.8 

because, even if he or she did feel confident, the cost of losing was entirely out of proportion 
to the issue at stake.

This analysis is reinforced by the fact that defamation damages (now much more the province 
of judges, with juries being confined to few cases) have become easier to assess and (in order 
not to outstrip damages for personal injuries) were unlikely to be particularly substantial. 
Aggravated  damages  have  always  been  modest  and  exemplary  damages  (intended  to  be 
punitive)  were  awarded  in  defamation  only  where  it  is  established  that  the  defendant’s 
conduct has been calculated to make a profit which might well exceed the compensation 
payable.14 Furthermore, in relation to privacy, the sum of £60,000 awarded to Max Mosley 
has been by far the largest award. In relation to his claim for exemplary damages, Mr Justice 
Eady  adopted  a  restricted  approach,  deciding  that  it  was  not  clear  that  misuse  of  private 
information  was  a  tort  to  which  the  possibility  of  exemplary  damages  should  necessarily 
extend: he considered it a matter for Parliament or, at the very least, the Supreme Court.15 
Thus, the largest sum in play in connection with many claims in defamation and privacy claims 
is undoubtedly the costs.16

The change of the law enacted by Part 2 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of 
Offenders Act 2012 will again alter the balance between those who complain about the press 
and the press itself. If damages for invasion of privacy are comparatively modest and there is 
no prospect of recovering either the uplift on costs that has previously been a feature of the 
CFA or the premium for ATE insurance, the economics of litigation move against those who 
would otherwise challenge the press in favour of the press. Neither has this point been lost 
on the Core Participant Victims, who have complained about their treatment at the hands of 
the press: many have given evidence to the effect that they have only been able to pursue a 
remedy against the News of the World (NoTW) because of the existence of the CFA regime 
and that without it, they would have been left without the wherewithal to pursue a claim for 
damages at all.17

Privacy  claims  and  claims  of  the  type  that  have  been  pursued  against  the  NoTW  are  not 
necessarily straightforward and, in the absence of appropriate legal assistance, there is no 
question of an equality of arms between those who claim to have been victimised and the 
press. The wealthy will be able to pursue a remedy in court; there will be less incentive for 
lawyers to take up the cases of those who are not because the potential uplift in costs now 
payable out of the damages is likely to be comparatively modest. Further, on the basis that the 
premium for ATE insurance will not be recoverable, it will be much more expensive to litigate 
with protection against an adverse order for costs and, in the absence of such protection, 
the risk of financial disaster may be real. On the other hand, it is not difficult to understand 

14 Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129
15 The reasons that Eady J gave were the absence of existing authority and concern about whether such a claim in 
relation to the misuse of private information satisfied the twin tests of necessity and proportionality in Art. 10 of the 
ECHR: see [2008] EWHC 1777, [2008] EMLR 20 at paras 172-197

1505

Chapter 3 | The Civil LawJthe  very  real  dangers  of  a  system  which  loads  costs  so  heavily  against  defendants,  such 
that it is never economic to contest a claim and always (almost irrespective of the merits) 
more sensible to compromise at an early stage. The consequent and real risk to freedom of 
expression (recognised in MGN Ltd v United Kingdom) is obvious.

3.9 

In recommending qualified one way costs shifting in defamation and privacy cases, Jackson LJ 
sought to find a balance between what might be described as the very substantial financial 
windfall of the CFA/ATE system on the one hand and the undeniable impact on access to 
justice by those without substantial means on the other. The recommendation has not found 
favour with the Government although it has emerged during the course of discussions about 
the draft Defamation Bill, now proceeding before Parliament. Thus, the Joint Committee on 
the Draft Defamation Bill18 observed (at para 89):

“We  are  concerned  that  defamation  law  will  become  even  less  accessible  to  the 
ordinary citizen because the Government does not plan to apply to defamation all 
Lord Justice Jackson’s proposals that protect access to justice. For example, in respect 
of personal injury claims, there will be a cap on the amount that can be charged by 
lawyers as a success fee of 25% of the damages awarded. This cap does not apply to 
other civil claims, leaving the existing costs associated with 100% success fees in place. 
The Government’s proposal to increase by 10% the level of general damages payable 
in civil cases is designed to go some way towards helping parties to pay for their own 
costs and to meet any success fee if they win. There is also the argument that parties 
are likely to take greater care over incurring costs when they are paying the costs 
themselves. However, we do not believe that the 10% increase in damages will be 
enough to make a difference, given that the average level of damages in defamation 
cases  is  no  more  than  £40,000,  and  costs  tend  to  be  in  measured  in  hundreds  of 
thousands when a case goes to court. The mechanism recommended by Lord Justice 
Jackson to protect the less well-off—known as “Qualified One Way Costs Shifting” 
(QOCS)—will  also  not  be  available  in  defamation  cases  under  the  Government’s 
proposals. This mechanism ensures that a claimant does not risk paying the costs of 
the defendant if the claim fails, unless they can afford to do so or have themselves 
acted unreasonably during proceedings. We consider that the application of this form 
of  protection  to  defamation  cases,  as  recommended  by  Lord  Justice  Jackson,  may 
go some way to towards addressing the financial inequality that often exists. It is 
outside our remit to explore the impact of the Government’s separate proposals on 
civil litigation costs reform in detail. Nonetheless we are sufficiently concerned about 
them to ask the Government to reconsider the implementation of the Jackson Report in 
respect of defamation actions, with a view to protecting further the interests of those 
without substantial financial means.” [The emphasis is that of the Joint Committee.]

3.10  The response of the Government summarised the argument and recited that conclusion but 

was not prepared, at this stage, to revisit the issue. It said:19

“74.  The current CFA regime with recoverable success fees and ATE insurance has 
led to high costs across all areas of civil  litigation,  but there have been particular 
concerns  in  defamation  and  privacy  cases.  These  high  and  disproportionate  costs 
hinder access to justice and can lead to a ‘chilling effect’ on journalism, and academic 
and  scientific  debate.  The  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  judgment  in  January 
2011  in  MGN  v  the  UK  (the  Naomi  Campbell  privacy  case)  found  the  existing  CFA 
arrangements on recoverability in that particular case to be contrary to Article 10

1506

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ(freedom of expression) of the Convention. Changes to the existing CFA regime are 
therefore necessary.
75.  The Government is aware of concerns around access to justice and the ability of 
those with modest means to pursue claims against often powerful media organisations. 
However, we do not believe that it is necessary to make any special provision in relation 
to the costs of privacy or defamation proceedings. As the Committee recognises, these 
claimants will benefit from a 10% increase in the general damages. The Government 
will continue to monitor the position following the implementation of the CFA reforms 
and the other reforms to the law and procedure for defamation  claims  which are 
being taken forward.”

3.11  The Court of Appeal has taken the lead in relation to the increase in damages. On 26 July 
2012,  in  Simmons  v  Castle,20  the  occasion  of  an  application  to  approve  a  settlement  in  a 
personal injury appeal was used by a court comprising the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of 
the Rolls and the Vice President of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) to increase general 
damages in tort (that is to say, in relation to non pecuniary loss) by 10% from current levels 
with effect from 1 April 2013. A further judgment adjusted the way in which the increase will 
be implemented to take account of the legislative change to CFA arrangements.21

3.12  The problem with this approach, on its own, is that it fails to take account of one aspect of 
the converse of the point recognised by Jackson LJ. He said (undoubtedly accurately) that 
a claimant would attach great value to winning his claim because the judgment would be 
vindication. In the case of defamation, that vindication is the public demonstration of success 
in the action, thereby neutralising the slander or libel. In the case of privacy, however, that 
which  was  private  is  no  longer  so  and,  irrespective  of  the  condemnation  that  might  flow 
from  a  judgment,  what  was  placed  in  the  public  domain  cannot  be  erased  (even  if  some 
references can be removed from the internet). A modest increase in damages (themselves 
usually modest) will provide little encouragement to a claimant otherwise anxious to seek 
what might be entirely justifiable redress.

3.13 

In the absence of some mechanism for cost free, expeditious access to justice, in my view, 
the failure to adopt the proposals suggested by Jackson LJ in relation to costs shifting will put 
access to justice in this type of case in real jeopardy, turning the clock back to the time when, 
in reality, only the very wealthy could pursue claims such as these. I recognise (as did Jackson 
LJ) that most personal injury litigation succeeds with the result that qualified one way costs 
shifting in place of recoverable but expensive ATE insurance is just as likely to cost insurers less 
and, furthermore, that the same cannot necessarily be said for defamation and privacy cases. 
An arbitral arm of a new regulator could provide such a mechanism which would benefit the 
public and equally be cost effective for the press;22 if such a scheme is not adopted, however, 
I have no doubt that the requirements of access to justice for all should prevail and that the 
proposals of Jackson LJ should be accepted: I return to this recommendation at the end of 
this Chapter.

regulation were issues which are central to this Inquiry: see para 68

Chapter 3 | The Civil LawJ4.	 The	substantive	civil	law
4.1 

The Inquiry has not provided a vehicle for detailed consideration of the substantive laws of 
defamation and privacy. As to defamation, Parliament is presently debating the Defamation 
Bill,  which  has  already  been  the  subject  of  pre-legislative  scrutiny  at  a  level  and  with  an 
expertise  that  I  would  not  hope  to  emulate.  In  the  circumstances,  I  do  not  consider  it  to 
be valuable either to go over that ground or to postulate what might be the effect of any 
legislation eventually enacted.

4.2 

4.3 

It might have been possible to review the law of privacy23 and there have been suggestions 
that a statutory enunciation of such a tort could be of value. Again, how it might be formulated 
and its possible extent has not been the subject of detailed evidence. In any event, the way 
in which the common law has addressed these issues has allowed flexibility of approach and 
a sensible enunciation of the relevant factors to be taken into account when balancing the 
competing issues in fact sensitive cases. I pay tribute to the work of the judges who have 
contributed to the jurisprudence in this area with clarity and care. It does not appear that 
legislative intervention will do other than generate further litigation as attempts are made 
to discover the extent to which the new framework matches the developing law.24 It goes 
without saying that any code will have to follow the law and that decisions of any regulator 
will have to follow the code: that is as far as it is necessary to go.

I take the same view in respect of a statutory definition of the concept of the public interest. 
Depending on the circumstances, different situations will invoke different aspects of the public 
interest and the relevant considerations will be fact sensitive and of variable significance. As 
time passes and different social culture and customs develop, so the test will have to adjust. 
Whereas a regulator should be able to identify the public interest in the context of the press 
(as the Editors’ Code of Conduct seeks to do), the ability to adapt is important. Again, in line 
with the view expressed by the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions, I endorse the 
view that the incremental approach of the courts to this concept is to be preferred and I do 
not recommend a statutory definition.25

5.	 Damages
5.1 

There  is  rather  more  to  say  on  the  subject  of  damages  because  of  the  need  to  treat  as 
commensurate  awards  for  non  pecuniary  loss  in  defamation  and  breach  of  privacy  with 
similar awards (reflecting pain, suffering and loss of amenity) in claims for personal injury. In 
an attempt to ensure that balance is maintained, in John v MGN Ltd26 Sir Thomas Bingham MR 
(as he then was) put the matter in this way:27

“There is force in the argument that to permit reference in libel cases to conventional 
levels of award in personal injury cases is simply to admit yet another incommensurable 
into the field of consideration. … The conventional compensatory scales in personal 
injury  cases  must  be  taken  to  represent  fair  compensation  in  such  cases  unless 
and until those scales are amended by the courts or by Parliament. It is in our view 
offensive to public opinion, and rightly so, that a defamation plaintiff should recover 

23 Appendix 4
24 This is the same view as that formed by the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions in its Report: see http://

damages for injury to reputation greater, perhaps by a significant factor, than if the 
same plaintiff had been rendered a helpless cripple or an insensate vegetable.”

Because of the primacy of the verdict of a jury, the assessment of damages in defamation 
could vary widely. Following Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd,28 trial judges were recommended to 
draw  the  attention  of  juries  to  the  purchasing  power  of  the  award  they  were  minded  to 
make  and  the  income  it  would  produce  and  John  marked  the  time  from  which  the  Court 
expressed the view that judges and counsel should be free to draw the attention of the jury 
to comparisons. Furthermore, in the light of the effect of s8 of the Courts and Legal Services 
Act 199029 the Court of Appeal is now far more willing to substitute its own view for that 
of the jury.30 As a result, more actions in defamation are now tried by judge alone (and the 
presumption in favour of jury trial is to be reversed by clause 8 of the Defamation Bill).

Considering the circumstances, it is not perhaps surprising that awards for breach of privacy 
or breach of confidence have generally been comparatively modest. As already pointed out, 
the sum awarded to Mr Mosley (£60,000) being by far the largest31 although there have been 
other substantial awards: in an action both for libel and breach of confidence, for the latter 
(which concerned the disclosure of confidential harmful information), £30,000 was awarded. 
This would have been £40,000 but for the double counting for distress which was part of a 
further £50,000 awarded for libel.32

Other examples are somewhat lower. They include £5,000 awarded for the publication of

unauthorised revelation of personal information. It would seem that the law is concerned to protect such matters as 
personal dignity, autonomy and integrity”. He went on (at para 216): “Thus it is reasonable to suppose that damages 
for such an infringement may include distress, hurt feelings and loss of dignity”.

I say at once that I do not consider it a coincidence that these last awards have been to those 
who could be described as ‘celebrities’: given the likely damages, it is only those who can 
afford it who have been able to bring such actions; CFAs might have assisted (as they have 
in the phone hacking litigation) but once, that source of funding is no longer available, the 
limited amount of money at stake and the high costs risks create a formidable obstacle for 
most, almost however egregious the breach of privacy or confidence might be. In saying this, 
I do not ignore the fact that many of these ‘celebrities’ chose to avail themselves of the CFA 
regime.

In the context of an award of the size which has been awarded in cases of the type discussed, 
an increase of 10% will have little effect and will do almost nothing to ameliorate the impact 
of the loss of a CFA. In any event, although I recognise that damages for breach of privacy and 
confidence must be fixed with an eye on the equivalence of damages for pain, suffering and 
loss of amenity in personal injury cases, I am not satisfied that the assessment is presently 
pitched at the right level. I put the point in that way because neither do I consider that it is 
appropriate for the Inquiry, examining a wide range of issues, to undertake a fundamental 
re-appraisal of damages in this area or make recommendations in relation to change. Rather,

it	 seems	 more	 sensible	 to	 pick	 up	 the	 suggestion	 that	 the	 damages	 should	 also	
be	available	for	breaches	of	data	protection	principles	(referable	to	the	duration,	
extent	and	gravity	of	the	contravention)37	and	to	recommend	a	review	of	damages	
generally	 available	 in	 this	 area,	 whether	 the	 cause	 of	 action	 is	 breach	 of	 data	
protection	or	privacy	or	breach	of	confidence	or	other	media	related	torts.

Although guidelines for damages in personal injury cases are available,38 there are none for 
privacy or breach of confidence; judges only have the examples of awards that have been 
made at first instance or considered by the Court of Appeal. Rather than being dependent 
on  a  single  view,  a  broader  approach  should  be  taken.  The  Civil  Justice  Council  (CJC)  was 
set up and established by s6 of the Civil Procedure Act 1997 and includes members of the 
judiciary, the professions, the civil service, consumer affairs bodies, lay advice and those able 
to represent the interests of particular litigants. Its functions include keeping the civil justice 
system under review, considering how to make it more accessible, fair and efficient, advising 
the  Lord  Chancellor  and  the  judiciary  on  the  development  of  the  civil  justice  system  and 
referring proposals for change to the Lord Chancellor and the Civil Procedure Rule Committee 
(CPRC).39 

In	the	circumstances,	I	recommend	that	the	Civil	Justice	Council	consider	the	level	of	
damages	in	privacy,	breach	of	confidence	and	data	protection	cases,	being	prepared	
to	take	evidence	(from	the	Information	Commissioner,	the	media	and	others)	and	
thereafter	 to	 make	 recommendations	 on	 the	 appropriate	 level	 of	 damages	 for	
distress	in	such	cases.	How	the	matter	is	then	taken	forward	will	ultimately	be	for	
the	courts	to	determine.40

Aggravated damages are primarily awarded to compensate for injury to pride and dignity, 
and the consequence of humiliation, and can include a penal element: this type of award is

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJthe subject of detailed consideration in the Report of the Law Commission on Aggravated, 
Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages.41

This	report,	as	long	ago	as	September	1997,	recommended	that	legislation	should	
provide	 that	 this	 head	 of	 damages	 should	 only	 be	 awarded	 to	 compensate	 for	
mental	 distress	 and	should	have	 no	punitive	 element.	 I	 do	not	seek	 to	 improve	
on	the	analysis	contained	in	that	report	and	recommend	that	it	be	adopted:	on	its	
own,	however,	it	will	not	make	a	significant	difference	to	the	overall	award.

5.9 

The question of exemplary damages is different and is itself worthy of consideration.

I  recognise  that  the  law  in  relation  to  the  award  of  exemplary  damages  is  by  no  means 
straightforward, having been considered in three cases in the House of Lords and one case in 
the Supreme Court in less than 50 years.42 An award can be made in only two categories at 
common law (oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of Government 
and cases in which the defendant’s unlawful conduct has been calculated by him to make a 
profit for himself, which may well exceed the compensation payable to the claimant) and, 
third, where expressly authorised by statute. In one sense, it is appropriate to argue that 
the type of invasion of privacy and defamation involved in many of the circumstances which 
have  been  examined  during  the  course  of  the  Inquiry  have  been  pursued  specifically  to 
make a profit (by maintaining of developing sales of the paper or encouraging readership 
rendering the publication more attractive for advertisers). On the other hand, I recognise the 
understandable reluctance of judges to extend this somewhat anomalous punitive jurisdiction 
without a clear basis in law for doing so.

5.10  Again, this topic was the subject of the Report by the Law Commission which recommended 
that  exemplary  damages  should  be  retained  (although  re-titled  as  punitive  damages).43  It 
recommended that such damages should only be awarded where, in committing a wrong, 
the defendant ‘deliberately and outrageously disregarded the [claimant’s] rights’. Moreover, 
it should be capable of being awarded for any tort (including breach of confidence) and would 
be  available  if  the  judge  considers  that  other  remedies  will  be  inadequate  to  punish  the 
defendant for his conduct; for these purposes, the court may regard deterring the defendant 
and others from similar conduct as an object of punishment.

5.11 

In that regard, it seems to me entirely appropriate that, when considering the question of 
exemplary damages, the court should be entitled to consider membership of a regulatory 
body as being relevant to the willingness to comply with standards (whether or not there 
was  a  failure  to  comply  in  relation  to  the  subject  matter  of  the  action).  In  addition,  the 
demonstration of good internal governance in relation to an appropriate audit by the editor 
as to the origin of stories should also be material. Equally, but on the other hand, a refusal 
to participate in a regulatory body might itself be evidence of a deliberate decision to stand 
outside any approved regulatory regime which itself could go towards the demonstration of 
outrageous disregard, as could the absence or failure of any adequate procedures for internal 
governance.

purposes of my recommendations

1511

Chapter 3 | The Civil LawJ5.12  Although  it  is  tempting  to  analyse  the  comparative  jurisprudence,  the  matter  is  fully 
discussed  by  the  Law  Commission  and  I  see  no  value  in  repeating  the  argument.  In  that 
regard, I recognise that the Law Commission Report equally deals with other difficult issues44 
which it is unnecessary for me to address. Having said that, to my mind, the basic principle 
is straightforward. The commercial benefit from publishing material obtained in breach of 
rights to privacy or confidence is likely greatly to exceed the basic award of damages (even if 
increased by the award of aggravated damages) and constitutes no real deterrent. In common 
with the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions, I have no doubt that the court should be 
able to award exemplary damages in privacy cases45 and, I would add, breach of confidence 
and similar media torts. 

In	 the	 circumstances,	 in	 line	 with	 the	 conclusion	 in	 the	 Report	 of	 the	 Law	
Commission	on	Aggravated,	Exemplary	and	Restitutionary	Damages,	I	recommend	
that	exemplary	damages	(whether	so	described	or	renamed	as	punitive	damages)	
should	be	available	in	actions	for	breach	of	privacy,	breach	of	confidence	and	similar	
media	torts	as	well	as	for	libel	and	slander.	Voluntary	participation	in	a	regulatory	
regime	 contained	 in	 or	 recognised	 by	 statute	 and	 good	 internal	 governance	 in	
relation	to	the	sourcing	of	stories	should	be	relevant	to	the	decisions	reached	in	
relation	to	such	damages.	

6.  Costs
6.1 

The impact over the years of different funding arrangements and costs regimes to litigation 
in  this  area  is  described  above.  Although  the  Government  has  made  clear  its  concerns 
around access to justice and the ability of those with modest means to pursue claims against 
often powerful media organisations, the recommendations made by Jackson LJ for one way 
qualified costs shifting have not, to date, found favour. As the Joint Committee observed, 
access to justice must be maintained for all citizens seeking to protect their right to privacy.46

6.2 

In the light of the very real difficulties facing those seeking access to justice, I have no doubt 
that a regulator needs to provide a speedy, effective and costs-free regime which provides 
a mechanism for those who complain that their rights have been infringed to be able seek 
redress. This is equally in the interests of the press who, although an increased number of 
complaints might be made, will equally be able to hold up the system as a model of dispute 
resolution  which  is  much  cheaper  (and  less  time  consuming)  than  litigation  through  the 
courts. It would need to be staffed by experienced media lawyers but there are retired High 
Court judges and others very experienced in this area of law who are more than capable 
of  taking  on  what  could  be  an  inquisitorial  jurisdiction  efficiently  to  resolve  all  but  those 
which both parties agree (or the judge determines) need court process. One such proposal is 
discussed as part of the regulatory regime later in the Report.47

6.3 

The purpose of this part of the Report is not to analyse the way in which such an arbitral system 
might operate but to consider how the law could recognise its existence and encourage its 
use. The mechanism for doing so is in relation to costs. Thus, Part 44.3 of the Civil Procedure 
Rules 1998 (as amended) specifically provides the court with a discretion as to whether costs 
should be payable by one party to another, the amount of those costs and when they are to

be paid; it identifies the general rule that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the 
costs of the successful party but specifically provides a discretion to make a different order. 
Included within all the circumstances to which the court must have regard is the conduct 
of the parties48 and the concept of conduct includes “conduct before, as well as during, the 
proceedings”.49 In that context, it is important to bear in mind the overriding objective of the 
Civil Procedure Rules to enable the court to deal with cases justly.50

There is no doubt that if a party to litigation turns down the opportunity to participate in 
ADR (particularly if encouraged by the court), costs consequences may follow. Thus, in Halsey 
v Milton Keynes General NHS Trust; Steel v Joy,51 the court considered the consequences of 
failure to participate in mediation as a form of alternative dispute resolution. It recognised 
that unreasonable refusal to agree to ADR could properly be reflected in adverse orders for 
costs and identified the relevant factors to be taken into account. In those cases, mediation 
was intended to encourage parties to reach an agreement on a sensible resolution of their 
dispute; arbitration (as here proposed) provides an alternative to a trial and is intended to be 
speedy, effective and without the cost implications of litigation in court. It results in a solution 
that is imposed by a judgment. The case for recognising the value of this form of dispute 
resolution (and the consequential saving of costs) is, therefore, much stronger and entirely 
consistent with the overriding objective of the Civil Procedure Rules.

This analysis provides ample precedent for the use of the powers of the court to encourage 
appropriate alternatives to litigation and there could be no better method for resolving a 
dispute with the press than by utilising a specialist tribunal, set up specifically for the purpose; 
it should be staffed by experts in media law who understood both the law and the practices 
of the press and so could cut through procedural complexity and resolve the issues speedily, 
cheaply and effectively.

It is obviously important that, before taking into account the availability of the remedy, the 
court would have to be satisfied that a mechanism for dispute resolution set up by one of 
the parties (in this case the publisher),  is fair: it would  not be sufficient if the alternative 
was an ad hoc arrangement in which nobody was representing the interests of the claimant. 
For that reason, I consider it very important that the arbitral system should be one part of 
a regulator which is recognised as being truly independent of the press and independent of 
any other interests which might affect its ability to be seen to be fair. An ad hoc arrangement 
(or even a settled scheme for one publisher) would be too dependent on the goodwill of 
those who made the arrangement or the publisher who set up the scheme to guarantee that 
independence.

If an arbitral mechanism was set up through the regulator, however, I see no reason why the 
courts should not embrace it as an extremely sensible method of pursuing the overriding 
objective in civil cases. In those circumstances, costs consequences could flow both ways. 
Thus, if the relevant media entity was regulated and thus able to utilise the availability of the 
arbitration service, it would be strongly arguable that a claimant who did not avail himself of 
that cheap and effective method of resolving his dispute but, instead, insisted on full blown 
High  Court  litigation,  should  be  deprived  of  any  costs  even  if  he  is  successful:  that  might

on an equal footing ; (b) saving expense; (c) dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the amount of 
money involved, to the importance of the case, to the complexity of the issues; and to the financial position of each 
party; (d) ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly; and (e) allotting to it an appropriate share of the court’s 
resources while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases

Chapter 3 | The Civil LawJ6.8 

also be a powerful incentive for a publisher to join the regulator, particularly if concerned 
that an extremely wealthy claimant might otherwise seek to overwhelm the publisher with 
expensive litigation out of all proportion to what was at stake.

Equally, however, if a publisher did not join the regulator, with the result that the specialist 
arbitral system was not available to a claimant wishing to pursue a remedy (particularly if of 
limited means and, thus, unable otherwise to obtain access to justice), I see no reason why 
the court should not be able to deprive even the successful publisher of costs that would not 
have been incurred had the alternative arbitration been available. I go further and suggest 
that, in a case legitimately brought and potentially borderline, the court would even retain 
the discretion to order the successful publisher to meet the costs of an unsuccessful claimant 
(although I recognise that this would not be the case if the court was dealing with vexatious 
or utterly misconceived litigation). Ultimately, the discretion of the court would govern all 
these issues, but I see only advantage in supporting an arbitral system that could be seen to 
have been independently set up and operated by a regulator, albeit itself set up by the press 
but managed and run independently of it.

6.9 

It  is  obviously  important  that  there  should  not  be  an  ever-running  argument  about  the 
adequacy of the arbitral mechanism. 

In	 the	 circumstances,	 I	 recommend	 that	 the	 Civil	 Procedure	 Rules	 should	 be	
amended	to	require	the	court,	when	considering	the	appropriate	order	for	costs	
at	the	conclusion	of	proceedings,	to	take	into	account	the	availability	of	an	arbitral	
system	set	up	by	an	independent	regulator	itself	recognised	by	law.52 the purpose 
of	this	recommendation	is	to	provide	an	important	incentive	for	every	publisher	to	
join	the	new	system	and	encourage	those	who	complain	that	their	rights	have	been	
infringed	to	use	it	as	a	speedy,	effective	and	comparatively	inexpensive	method	of	
resolving disputes.

6.10 

It  is  obviously  necessary  to  consider  the  alternative,  that  is  to  say,  what  would  happen  if 
there was no identifiably independent regulator that could be recognised by the courts as 
providing an acceptable alternative mechanism for the resolution of disputes. It is here that I 
share the very real concern expressed by the Joint Committee in relation to access to justice. 
The prospect of returning to a system whereby only the very rich could pursue defamation, 
breaches  of  privacy  and  confidence  or  other  claims  in  tort  against  publishers  because  of 
the potential costs consequences would, in my view, be a seriously retrograde step in our 
attempts to provide justice for all. In my view, it is simply not acceptable. The very least that 
could be done is to revert to the scheme proposed by Jackson LJ.

In	the	absence	of	the	provision	of	an	alternative	mechanism	for	dispute	resolution,	
available	 through	 an	 independent	 regulator	 without	 cost	 to	 the	 complainant,	
together	with	an	adjustment	to	the	Civil	Procedure	Rule	to	require	or	permit	the	
court	to	take	account	of	the	availability	of	cost	free	arbitration	as	an	alternative	
to	 court	 proceedings	 when	 considering	 orders	 for	 costs	 at	 the	 conclusion	 of	
proceedings,	I	recommend	that	qualified	one	way	costs	shifting	be	introduced	for	
defamation,	privacy,	breach	of	confidence	and	similar	media	related	litigation	as	
proposed	by	Lord	Justice	Jackson.

THE PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION 
AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS

Introduction
The  Press  Complaints  Commission  (PCC)  has  always  been  a  voluntary  system  based  on  a 
network of implied contracts. Accordingly, participation has been optional, and in the event 
never  universal;  and  has  always  been  contingent  on  an  evaluation  by  individual  titles  or 
publishers of their self-interest. Newspapers notionally sign up, and remain tied into the rules 
of the system, but only for the period and to the extent that they judge that this is in their 
best  interests.  The  self-regulatory  system  as  a  whole,  and  by  this  I  include  its  less  visible 
elements, the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF) and the Editors’ Code of Practice Committee, 
are intertwined legally and functionally symbiotic.

It follows from this that criticisms of the PCC have often been too specifically directed and as 
such may have missed their mark; it is the system as a whole which should be the accurate 
target. The way in which the various parts interact is the hallmark of the system as I have 
broadly defined it; in a less obvious but equally powerful way it should also be regarded as 
the key descriptor of the relationship that the industry has with the PCC. Although the system 
as constituted in this manner unravelled, in spectacular fashion, in July 2011, the inherent 
weakness was there for all to see almost from the very start.

There  were  aspects  of  the  work  that  the  PCC  did  well  which  should  not  be  overlooked 
or  minimised  as  the  weaknesses  of  the  system  are  exposed.  The  secretariat  worked  very 
hard; in many cases the PCC managed to negotiate or mediate settlements which resulted 
in  proportionate  redress  and  satisfied  complainants.  Some  of  the  pre-publication  work 
undertaken by the PCC was effective and has assisted people under real pressure from the 
industry. The two directors of the PCC who gave evidence on these matters1 were impressive 
and dedicated individuals who worked tirelessly, often in difficult circumstances.

Throughout, my Report has not sought to blame individuals but to focus on practices and 
systems.  I  will  continue  with  this  approach  although  the  evidence  demonstrates  that  the 
stature and profile of the PCC has, to some considerable extent, depended on the quality 
and personality of its Chairs. In the circumstances, I will refer to each of the four who gave 
evidence; they tackled different issues at different times and did so with differing degrees 
of success. This analysis of their stewardship of the PCC is a significant part of the overall 
narrative. Even so, my headline assessment is that the problem was and is systemic: the PCC is 
hidebound by its inherent structure such that it has lacked the powers and sanctions required 
to do an effective job, which was – or at least ought to have been – to regulate the industry 
under its umbrella. Instead, self-regulation was simultaneously a panacea, a misnomer and 
a contradiction in terms. The press caused or permitted it to pronounce itself as a model of 
self-regulation for the press as a whole but the upshot was something well short of regulation 
properly so-called.

1.5 

The PCC was not independent from the industry it was overseeing, causing problems both 
of  substance  and  of  perception.  The  way  in  which  it  and  the  self-regulatory  system  more 
generally conducted itself in public was often unhelpful. The purported investigations into

have no reason to exempt him from the observations I make about his successors

Jpress misconduct, most notably the two reports into phone hacking, were ineffectual and 
inadequate; and their conclusions, apparently exculpating the News of the World (NoTW), 
and, as it happens all other titles, from the accusations of serious misconduct, gave false 
comfort  to  policy-makers  and  the  public.  Taken  together  these  factors  caused  the  self-
regulatory system to fail. However good the rest of the work that the PCC did, it steadily lost 
the trust of key stakeholders, culminating in a final flight of trust and confidence in the wake 
of the revelations which triggered this Inquiry to be set up.

1.6 

By July 2011, some might say somewhat late in the day, key politicians had also lost faith in 
the self-regulatory system. On 8 July 2011, the Prime Minister said that the PCC had failed 
and needed to be replaced:2

“Let’s  be  honest.  The  Press  Complaints  Commission  has  failed.  In  this  case,  the 
hacking case, frankly it was pretty much absent. Therefore we have to conclude that 
it’s ineffective and lacking in rigour.
There  is  a  strong  case  for  saying  it’s  institutionally  conflicted  because  competing 
newspapers judge each other. As a result it lacks public confidence. I believe we need 
a new system entirely. It will be for the inquiry to recommend what the system should 
look like.
“But  my  starting  presumption  is  that  it  should  be  truly  independent,  independent 
from the press, so the public will know that newspapers will never again be solely 
responsible for policing themselves. But vitally, independent of government, so the 
public will know that politicians are not trying to control or muzzle a press that must 
be free to hold politicians to account.”

1.7 

The Deputy Prime Minister also agreed that the PCC and the self-regulatory system generally 
had failed.3 The Leader of the Opposition, said in a speech on 8 July 2011 that:4

“…we  need  wholesale  reform  of  our  system  of  regulation.  The  Press  Complaints 
Commission has failed. It failed to get to the bottom of the allegations about what 
happened at News International in 2009. Its chair admits she was lied to but could do 
nothing about it. The PCC was established to be a watchdog. But it has been exposed 
as a toothless poodle. Wherever blame lies for this, the PCC cannot restore trust in 
self-regulation. It is time to put the PCC out of its misery. We need a new watchdog.”

1.8 

Significant  sections  of  the  press  had  also  lost  confidence  in  the  self-regulatory  system.  In 
January 2011, by refusing to make the appropriate contribution through PressBoF, Northern 
& Shell left the PCC which meant that it could no longer offer a service in relation to Express 
Newspapers or the Star titles. Both Richard Desmond, the proprietor of the Northern & Shell 
group, and Paul Ashford the Group Editorial Director, gave evidence that one of the key factors 
that prompted Northern & Shell’s withdrawal from the self-regulatory structure was that they 
had lost confidence in the PCC; in particular, they were not confident of its independence.5

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJEven if there may have been an element of the self-serving in this assessment, it is not difficult 
to understand why that might have been. In any event, other key newspaper figures had also 
begun to lose faith in the PCC. The editor of the Financial Times, Lionel Barber, gave evidence 
to the Inquiry that the PCC’s decision to criticise the Guardian in its 2009 report into phone 
hacking was a serious misstep, and that “as a result of that I believe that the body has lost 
credibility”.6

1.9 

Furthermore,  the  self-regulatory  system  was  not  trusted  by  many  of  the  organisations 
representing the interests of the people and groups who became the subject of media coverage. 
For example Trans Media Watch, an organisation dedicated to combating discriminatory and 
or derogatory coverage of transgender and intersex people in the media, submitted evidence 
that “The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) is widely regarded as an ineffective joke by the 
transgender community.”7 Individuals who were regularly the subject of press attention, and 
those who had been the victims of press intrusion, likewise did not have confidence in the 
PCC. The actor Steve Coogan, for example, gave evidence that he did not have confidence in 
the independence of the PCC, and concluded that “If I had more faith in it, then I’d use it”.8

1.10  Experienced media lawyers, who have dealt routinely with issues of inaccuracy and intrusion, 
both of which fall within the PCC’s remit, also gave evidence that they had lost faith in the 
capacity of the PCC. Mark Thomson, a lawyer who has represented many victims of press 
intrusion, was of the view that the PCC was not sufficiently effective or independent of the 
press.9 Another media lawyer, Graham Shear, agreed.10

1.11  By the summer of 2011, the standing of the self-regulatory system in general and the PCC 
in particular had deteriorated further. Although key stakeholders and observers may have 
had differing experiences of the press and their views may have been coloured by various 
interests, their common conclusion that the self-regulatory structure had failed cannot be 
explained away by self-interest or subjective perspective.

1.12  Ultimately, this disintegration of trust in the PCC was the straw breaking the camel’s back. In 
the absence of any powers to compel anybody, the PCC was reliant on the continued trust 
and confidence of the public, politicians and the press in its authority; and in its capacity to 
enforce proper standards of press behaviour. What remained of the PCC’s authority departed 
with the flight of trust and everyone agrees that it is no longer viable for the current self-
regulatory structure to continue in its present form or state.

1.13 

I cannot emphasise too strongly that the revelations of July 2011 must not be visualised in 
any sort of self-contained way as a watershed or a bolt from the blue in the context of the 
21 year history of the PCC. To interpret events in such a way would, in my view, amount to 
a form of historical revisionism which ignores the whole of the post-War narrative and the 
performance of the PCC since its creation in 1991. Arguably, though, one may detect elements 
of such an approach in some of the less than wholly self-critical statements by PressBoF and 
the PCC itself as late as 2009/2010.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J1.14  Having introduced the issues in this way, the next section of this Chapter will address these 
systemic  issues  on  a  thematic  rather  than  a  chronological  basis.  To  be  fair  to  the  PCC,  it 
would be insufficient merely to rehearse the fact that political and public support for it has 
evaporated. Although I have to record and recognise that, as a practical reality, since on any 
view it would justify (if not require) fundamental change, the reasons for such loss of support 
do need to be examined and set out.

1.15  The sections of this Chapter that follow look by turns at the PCC’s lack of any meaningful 
independence from the industry it purported to regulate; the self-association and alignment 
of the PCC with the interests of the industry rather those who were the victims of mistreatment 
by the press; the systemic failings in the system of self-regulation; and the failures in regulatory 
delivery. Lastly, this Chapter will examine the investigatory failures of the PCC both in relation 
to the findings of Operation Motorman and the allegations of phone hacking at the NoTW 
both in 2007 and 2009.

2.  What the PCC did well
2.1 

Before starting on an analysis of what went wrong, I should record what the PCC did well.

2.2 

2.3 

2.4 

Successive  witnesses  gave  evidence  that  the  PCC  secretariat,  in  particular  the  complaints 
officers who handled complaints made by members of the public, were polite, efficient and 
dedicated.11 Members of the PCC secretariat worked hard in the public interest, as I have said, 
in sometimes difficult circumstances. The PCC established and then ran a 24 hour helpline 
for complainants, staffed by a small number of officers working in rotation.12 For a relatively 
small team to have handled the large volume of complaints received by the PCC speaks of 
the dedication and commitment of individual staff members. I have seen no evidence and 
heard  no  suggestion  that  the  manner  in  which  the  members  of  the  PCC  secretariat  have 
gone about their work has led or, in any sense, contributed to the limitations of the PCC as an 
organisation. I have no doubt that PCC staff did as well as is possible within the bounds set by 
the self-regulatory system.

I  also  heard  evidence  from  the  then  current  director  of  the  PCC,  Stephen  Abell,  and  his 
immediate predecessor, Tim Toulmin, of the work done by PCC staff on a day to day basis. I 
should add that Mr Abell’s witness statement was a genuine tour de force and I pay tribute 
to the immense care he has taken and the diligence he has shown. Through their respective 
evidence,  each  demonstrated  his  dedication  and  loyalty  to  an  organisation  which  faced  a 
naturally daunting task.

The efforts of the PCC at mediation and conciliation were often helpful. Dr Martin Moore, 
the Director of the Media Standards Trust,13 highlighted “the genuine benefits of the current 
system, particularly with regard to the secretariat and the role they’ve played in conciliating 
and mediating complaints on behalf of complainants, and the very real attempt to both write 
and evolve the code over that 20-year period [that the PCC has been in existence]”.14 On most

13 Having paid fulsome tribute to Mr Abell’s witness statement, I should also record my admiration for the Media 
Standard Trust’s work in this area. The relevant material and submissions is on the Inquiry website. Given its 
comprehensiveness, I have sought to boil the issues down somewhat

1518

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJoccasions, complainants were satisfied with the mediated and agreed solutions to problems; 
and this was a job that the PCC was good at.15 In appropriate cases, and no doubt there are 
many, a mediated settlement is a sensible way of dealing with disputes between parties.

2.5 

The  PCC  was  also,  on  occasion,  able  to  mitigate  extreme  media  pressure  on  newsworthy 
individuals.16 Dr Gerry McCann, for example, gave evidence that the PCC managed to limit the 
intrusion by journalists and press photographers into the lives of his twin son and daughter in 
the aftermath of the disappearance of his daughter Madeleine:17

“The  PCC  was  extremely  helpful  in  dealing  with  the  unwanted  intrusion  into  the 
privacy of our twins. In particular, the press were constantly taking photographs in 
which our children were included. Having contacted the PCC this quickly stopped”.

2.6 

Baroness  Buscombe,  the  former  Chair  of  the  PCC,  said  of  this  aspect  of  the  PCC’s  pre-
publication work that:18

“This is an area of [the PCC’s] work that has developed in recent years and which has 
had an enormously beneficial impact… I well recall that when I began working at the 
PCC, I was amazed by the degree to which we are able to stop within hours or minutes 
the  publication  of  information,  including  pictures,  where  there  was  a  potential 
breach of the Code. The key to this is strong and very responsive engagement with 
the industry, night and day.”

2.7 

In  some  cases  the  pre-publication  guidance  which  the  PCC  produced  was  effective,  and 
resulted in some improvements to the press coverage of the issues concerned. For example, 
the PCC has worked hard to improve the coverage of mental health issues. To this end, the 
PCC has produced a guidance note on the subject and has delivered training to journalists.19 
It is difficult to form a clear judgment about this, but the sense I have is that press reporting 
on some aspects of mental health issues has improved, and the insensitive and in many cases 
offensive language deployed in some sections of the press ten years ago is now rarely used. 
However, in this context, I note the evidence submitted by organisations such as Mind and 
Rethink  Mental  Illness  which  indicates  that  problems  remain.  Recognising  this,  the  points 
they make reflect on the press in general rather than on the PCC.

2.8 

I should record that there are other instances where the efforts of the PCC in respect of pre-
publication action have not been so successful. For example, the Inquiry has heard evidence 
from Helen Belcher of Trans Media Watch, who recalled that this organisation worked with 
the PCC to try to improve press coverage of intersex and transgender people. The PCC agreed 
to endorse a style guide prepared by Trans Media Watch. This was completed in February

2011 and distributed among newspaper editors and to some individual journalists. However, 
in the view of Ms Belcher “its impact has, to date, appeared to be extremely limited.”20

Independence from the industry
A profound lack of any functional or meaningful independence from the industry that the 
PCC claimed to regulate lay at the heart of the failure of the system of self-regulation for the 
press. Independence operates at two levels, one of perception and the other of substance. In 
terms of perception, just as judges cannot in any sense be perceived as being judges in their 
own cause, or appearing to be biased or otherwise interested in the outcome, a regulator 
must be so constituted as to satisfy every reasonable complainant that he or she will receive 
a fair hearing in all respects and at all levels. In terms of substance, a regulator will not be 
free to do its job properly if tied functionally to the entities it is regulating. Further, there is a 
not insubstantial risk that, if those that are being regulated take the view that they are being 
judged by fierce competitors for whom they have neither trust nor respect (even if there 
is a majority of lay members of the Commission), they will not regard the discharge of the 
regulator’s duties in the correct light.

The self-regulatory system for the press, taken as a whole, is not in any way independent of 
the industry. In particular, two out of the three elements of the self-regulatory structure – 
PressBoF (on whom the PCC is dependent for its funding) and the Editors’ Code of Practice 
Committee – are wholly composed of serving industry figures and, in both cases, extremely 
senior industry figures. While the PCC may itself be made up of a majority of lay members, 
for the reasons explored below this does not make the PCC functionally independent from 
the industry.

Funding
The  PCC’s  funding  is  derived  from  subscriptions  raised  voluntarily  from  the  industry.  The 
budget for the PCC is negotiated between the PCC and PressBoF and the agreed funds are 
then levied from the industry. In the words of Baroness Buscombe, “[p]ublic confidence is 
plainly more difficult to establish in this context”.21 Lord Grade, a lay PCC commissioner, made 
the point in the following way:22

“…the fact that PressBoF controls the purse strings leaves them in the position where 
– which they either do or they don’t abuse – I don’t have enough experience yet, but it 
leaves them in the position where they can have a huge influence on the constitution 
and the running of the organisation. I don’t think that’s healthy.”

3.4 

Of course, other regulators are funded solely with monies raised from the regulated industry. 
One example of this is the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which is wholly funded by 
a levy raised on the advertising industry through the funding body ASBoF. The difference, as 
Baroness Buscombe has made clear, is that in contrast to ASBoF, PressBoF sought to be far 
more ‘hands on’ in relation to expenditure issues.23

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ3.5 

I  recognise  that  PressBoF  itself  robustly  denies  that  it  seeks  to  exercise  any  measure  of 
control, pointing out that there have been no occasions on which a request by the PCC for 
extra funding has been turned down. However, in my view this misunderstands the nature of 
the relationship between the two bodies: PressBoF was the ultimate paymaster, and the PCC 
no doubt understood the difficulties inherent in asking for more.

3.6 

In reality, the functional independence of the PCC was restricted by the limited resources 
which  the  industry  supplied.  Here,  I  am  content  to  adopt  Professor  Greenslade’s  analysis 
which in my view fairly encapsulates the position:24

“That is the reason I have often referred to the Commission being subject to “string 
pulling”  by  its  paymasters,  the  Press  Board  of  Finance  (PressBoF).  This  has  been 
wrongly taken to mean that I was suggesting PressBoF members, or people acting for 
them, made interventions in individual cases. As far as I’m aware, that never happened, 
and that indeed was my point: it did not need to happen. The PCC’s chairmen and 
directors could not be other than aware of the vulnerability of the Commission and of 
their own positions when attempting to hold their own paymasters to account (and 
I  am  deliberately  choosing  to  use  a  phrase  borrowed  from  the  journalistic  lexicon 
about “holding power to account”). They were regulating, or seeming to regulate, 
the people on whose very existence they depended.”

3.7 

It is also clear to me that the funding made available to the PCC is barely sufficient to enable 
it to conduct its complaints handling functions effectively. Further, in so limiting the funding 
available  to  the  PCC,  the  organisation  was  unable  to  exercise  other  functions  that  might 
be properly expected of a regulator, for example, in relation to investigations into industry 
conduct, and the promotion of standards. Although in submissions to the Inquiry, Lord Black 
on behalf of PressBoF has disputed that the PCC is under-funded, I recall two other important 
pieces of evidence in this regard. First, the lack of funding was characterised by Baroness 
Buscombe as “a fundamental problem…I believe that the industry could have and should have 
done more to support the PCC in this regard, notwithstanding the sector’s own commercial 
pressures”.25 She continued:26

“[The  PCC’s]  performance  runs  the  risk  of  being  compromised  because  of  lack  of 
adequate funding…whilst there has been a real desire on the part of all of us at the 
PCC to raise our game, a significant lack of resource makes this frankly impossible. 
The PCC functions because the 16 staff work very long hours and the current director 
[Stephen Abell] is working and on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, as is the Head 
of  Complaints  and  other  staff  members.  This  is  simply  not  sustainable  and  is  not 
reasonable or sensible given the nature of our work (critical judgment calls  made 
within tight time constraints and its importance to society at large.” 

3.8 

Second, in June 2010, at the request of PressBoF, the PCC Director Stephen Abell undertook a 
financial review of the organisation. His conclusions were summarised as follows:27

“The  [PCC  Business  Affairs]  Committee,  of  course,  recognises  both  the  financial 
position of the newspaper and magazine industry and the current economic climate. 
However, its starting position – having conducted this requested review – is that the

1521

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness JPCC remains considerably underfunded as an organisation. In the last five years, the 
work  of  the  PCC  has  increased  significantly  (in  terms  of  formal  complaints  made, 
resolved, ruled upon; in the proactive work and pre-publication work undertaken by 
the  staff;  and  in  the  training  of  working  journalists).  Scrutiny  of  the  PCC  has  also 
increased. In the same five years, the PCC’s funding has not increased in real terms.”

3.9 

Although I do not question Lord Black’s evidence in this regard, and Baroness Buscombe’s 
evidence  does  not  suggest  that  any  specific  requests  for  additional  funding  were  turned 
down, in my view the issue may turn on properly defining the nature and function of the 
body  under  discussion.  A  body  with  limited  powers  would  clearly  cost  less  to  run  than  a 
regulator properly so-called. I do not overlook the fact that the newspaper industry faces very 
substantial financial pressures and has done for some time. However, notwithstanding those 
pressures the industry does not give the PCC enough money to carry out the range of roles 
and functions it needs to. Beyond providing barely enough to allow the PCC to fulfil what is 
commonly understood to be its primary role, namely to deal with individual complaints, as 
the supposed regulator for the industry, it has been hamstrung by a critical lack of resource 
and is unable to fulfil any of the other functions which would normally be expected from a 
regulator and which the Articles of Association permitted.

Appointments – the Chair

3.10  The  Chair  of  the  PCC  is  formally  appointed  by  PressBoF,  as  has  been  described  in  Part  D 

Chapter 2.

3.11  The  appointment  process  has  evolved  over  the  period  for  which  the  PCC  has  been  in 
existence. When Lord Wakeham was appointed Chair in 1995 the process was informal; he 
was simply approached by the then Chair of PressBoF, Sir Harry Roche, and his shoulder was 
metaphorically tapped.28 For the appointment of Lord Hunt, as more fully discussed below, 
an independent assessor was involved in the process, as well as involvement by some of the 
lay members.29

3.12  Lord  Wakeham  identified  a  number  of  reasons  why  he  believed  that  he  was  considered 
appropriate for the role of Chair of the PCC, chief among them being that the self-regulatory 
system was at that point under considerable pressure and the press wanted a candidate who 
could safeguard that system from what it regarded as the threat of statute:30

“I think the newspaper industry did not want statutory control and that they accepted 
they needed someone to be the chairman with a bit of clout, who could stop statutory 
control by getting the standards up to an acceptable level...They wanted someone on 
side with the government because they did not want statutory regulation.”

3.13  Lord Wakeham also said that “I was regarded as a strong supporter of press freedom and self 
regulation. It was widely known that I had chaired the Committee that had rejected Calcutt 
and come down in favour of self regulation.”31 Indeed, he went further and made clear that

1522

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJhe regarded it as a pre-requisite of anyone being involved in the PCC that he or she should be 
committed to both these principles.32 This evidence was as frank as it was unsurprising. In this 
regard, Lord Wakeham did not buck the trend, nor did any of his successors.

3.14  The appointments process has since become more formalised. However, applicants for the 
post of Chair of the PCC are still required to have broadly similar qualities to those which led 
to Lord Wakeham being approached. Both Sir Christopher Meyer and Baroness Buscombe 
were asked in their appointment interviews whether they were supporters of press freedom 
and believers in self-regulation.33 Indeed, Sir Christopher went to some lengths to make clear 
his support for the principle of press self-regulation on a number of occasions. In a speech 
delivered at the beginning of his tenure as the Chair of the PCC, Sir Christopher said that:34

“Liberty and self regulation are inextricably linked. Any infringement of self regulation 
would not just erode the freedoms of the press. Far more importantly it would curtail 
the freedoms of the citizen, who in a democratic society will always depend on media 
uninhibited by both control of the state and deference to the establishment to protect 
their liberty. That is why self regulation – and all the jagged edges that come with 
it – must be protected, must be nurtured, and must grow.”

Sir Christopher maintained the same view in evidence given to the Inquiry. He said:35

“is self-regulation the only way consistent with maintaining freedom of expression 
and the press’ status as an exponent of that? The short answer is: yes.”

3.15 

In maintaining his position in this way, Sir Christopher appears to be adopting what I consider 
to be a somewhat remarkable position. First, the equation between liberty and self-regulation 
– almost as a philosophical position – is in my view simplistic and capable of being overly 
alarmist.  I  have  explained  why  this  is  so  in  Part  B  above,  and  in  Part  K  Chapter  7  below. 
Second, and perhaps in this context more significantly, these public statements extolling the 
virtues of self-regulation (coupled in Sir Christopher’s case with equating self-regulation by 
the PCC with regulation properly so-called) certainly created the impression that the Chair 
and the industry itself were speaking with one voice on an issue on which they had identical, 
strong views. It also created the impression that the status quo in what might be called ‘very 
light’ regulation was acceptable, and that anything else was not. Ultimately, these amounted 
to the expression of political judgments which might have left complainants asking the not 
impertinent question: what about the private rights of the individual?

3.16  Lord Hunt was appointed to Chair of the PCC in October 2011, in succession to Baroness 
Buscombe who had resigned in July that year. The advertisement for the post had stated that 
the successful applicant had to be committed to the principles of freedom of the press and 
of self-regulation,36 and he confirmed that he was wedded to those principles, and explained 
why. Lord Hunt also confirmed that Lord Wakeham had had some role in persuading him to

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jput his hat in the ring,37 notwithstanding that recruitment consultants were also involved in 
the process.

3.17  Exactly  what  happened  is  somewhat  opaque.  Despite  an  on-going  process  of  reform,  the 
appointment  process  appears  to  be  neither  transparent  nor  impartial.  Whilst  it  is  not 
unexpected  that  candidates  might  be  canvassed  as  to  their  views  on  self-regulation  and 
expected  to  support  the  principles  of  self-regulation,  at  the  very  least  the  appointments 
process risked giving rise to the perception that the Chair was beholden to the regulated 
industry. Further, it is clear that Lord Hunt is the last in a line of PCC Chairs who appears to 
have regarded freedom of the press, particularly as defined in the Editors’ Code of Practice 
and self-regulation, as synonymous.

Appointment of other members of the PCC

3.18  Lay members of the PCC are also required to be committed to the principles of self-regulation 
and the freedom of the press. This appears also to have meant that, above all else, they too 
should be supportive of the idea of freedom of expression or press freedom as set out in 
the Editors’ Code of Practice.38 In his interview to become a PCC Commissioner Lord Grade 
recalled that he was asked whether or not he supported statutory regulation.39 However, it 
has recently been pointed out by His Honour Jeremy Roberts QC (formerly a distinguished 
criminal judge) and others that the Inquiry may have received an unbalanced perspective on 
this point. For example, he recalls that Mr Abell asked him a question at his interview about 
the balance between Article 8 and Article 10 rights, and Lord Grade now recalls that he was 
also asked a similar question.

3.19  Whilst acknowledging this point, it is, however, clear that, an a priori commitment to the 
principles of self-regulation amounted in practice to a commitment to the system of self-
regulation through the PCC. Having heard some evidence as to the very different individuals 
who comprise the lay members of the PCC (which I touch on below), it is nevertheless clear 
that those individuals were all recruited from a narrow class of people already committed to 
the principle of self-regulation by the industry and, effectively, in the form that it existed, that 
is to say, to the preservation of the status quo.

Serving editors on the PCC

3.20  Newspaper editors currently in post serve on the PCC, albeit as a minority. This raises at the 
very least the appearance of bias, creating the concern that the industry was ‘marking its 
own homework’. While editors do not take part in discussions on complaints relating to their 
own newspapers, or newspapers from the same group, they have and may be seen to have 
a commonality of interests in directing the overall analysis of the balance between freedom 
to publish and the rights of third parties in a manner which might overly protect the former 
over the latter and may not place sufficient restrictions on press behaviour, or at least create 
the perception of so doing.

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ3.21 

It has been suggested that, since editors are in a minority on the PCC, their presence does not 
in fact threaten the independence of PCC decision-making.40 I record that this suggestion was 
also reinforced in the submission received from His Honour Jeremy Roberts QC, supported 
by the evidence of his lay commissioner colleagues. I understand and respect the points that 
have been made, and return to them below, and should not be interpreted as saying that 
individual lay commissioners have failed in their duty. Rather, the stand out issue is about 
systems and independence of decision-making viewed in the round.

3.22  On  that  basis  alone,  I  am  unable  to  accept  this  argument  for  a  number  of  reasons.  First, 
even  if  not  a  majority,  the  editors  formed  a  substantial  bloc  within  the  PCC  who,  by  dint 
of  their  experience  and  practical  knowledge  of  the  industry,  would  be  likely  to  exercise  a 
disproportionate  influence.  Even  if  that  is  not  so,  at  the  very  least,  this  would  be  how 
reasonable observers would view the matter. These influences would undeniably be mitigated 
if the industry had chosen to populate the PCC with more former editors, serving journalists 
and  NUJ  members,  likely  to  inject  a  more  independent-minded  approach.  Instead,  expert 
industry knowledge was concentrated in the hands of editors only.

3.23  Second, the PCC operates a principle of abiding by precedent, looking to previous decisions 
for guidance when deciding cases and seeking to keep decisions consistent.41 Key decisions 
are collated in the Editors’ Codebook, an amplified version of the Editors’ Code of Practice. 
A  decision  in  one  case  would  determine  or  at  least  influence  the  approach  taken  by  the 
PCC in a similar case in future.42 Although unexceptional when viewed in isolation from all 
other considerations, this state of affairs far from eliminates the conflict of interest which is 
acknowledged by editors leaving the room when their own newspaper or a sister paper is 
being discussed. An awareness that an adjudication in the instant case might well impact on 
the application of the Code to a future case, in which the adjudicating editor’s own title might 
be involved, creates an inherent conflict between the interests of serving editors and doing of 
full justice to the complaint and the person who made it.

3.24  This is not a practice shared by other regulators and with good reason. Ofcom, charged with 
the different but  (for these purposes)  comparable  task of  regulating  the broadcast media 
industry, does not have anyone currently active in the industry on the board which adjudicates 
on breaches of the Broadcasting Code. The Chair of Ofcom, Dr Collette Bowe, described the 
structure of Ofcom in the following way:43

“the  board  member  who  leads  the  work  on  the  enforcement  of  standards  in 
broadcasting  is  himself  a  well-known,  very  distinguished  broadcast  journalist, 
formerly of the BBC and then of Channel 4, who brings a large amount of experience 
to that role, but we do not regard it as appropriate to have people who are engaged 
very actively in the industry as members of the board.
Q.  Why is that?

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness JDR  BOWE:  Because  of  conflicts.  I’m  sure  you’re  familiar  with  the  sorts  of  issues 
that arise, and you can manage small conflicts on boards; you can’t manage large, 
endemic ones.”

3.25 

I recognise that PCC witnesses gave evidence (which I entirely accept) that the lay or public 
members of the PCC are independently-minded, often strong-willed individuals who are not 
intimidated by the presence of editors:44

“I think if you look at the list of people who served on the Commission, it’s an impressive 
list of people who have either spent a life in public service or politics…they’ve excelled 
in their field in one way or another. These aren’t patsies at all. Obviously, I was in 
every  single  Commission  meeting  whilst  I  was  director  and  there  would  be  some 
excellent knock-about debates. So these weren’t people who were in any way cowed 
by the presence of a few editors.”

3.26  Lord Grade was also asked for his perspective on this point. His answer should be set out in 

full.45

“I’ve never experienced that. I must have attended now eight or nine meetings. Where 
a case is going against a newspaper, where the recommendation of the officers is 
that there’s been a clear breach of the code – such-and-such a clause in the code, 
the editorial figures on the board, who are in a minority, are the first to speak out 
in condemnation and say, “I can’t believe they did that, that was a –” you know, it’s 
a very, very honest debate. A very, very honest debate. Anybody with an interest, 
obviously, leaves the room at that point, if they’re part of a group and it’s one of their 
newspapers in the group, whether it’s a local newspaper or national newspaper. No, 
the debates are very, very, very fair. There are debates about the wording and quite 
often – I can’t think of an example at the moment because we get papers that thick 
every week (indicates). There are examples where editorial figures around that table 
have strengthened the criticism in the adjudication. So I don’t have any issue in that 
regard whatsoever, and I wouldn’t – personally speaking, I wouldn’t be there if that 
was the case. I wouldn’t stay there if that was the case.”

3.27 

3.28 

I  also  expressly  record  that  Tim  Toulmin  rejected  the  criticism  that  there  were  no 
representatives of the victims of press intrusion on the PCC, saying that “people who work 
at the PCC, whether they’re on the board or full time staff, are motivated by trying to assist 
people who are having difficulties with the press, particularly those vulnerable people who 
can’t afford a lawyer and so on.”46

It may well be unnecessary, if not inappropriate, to ensure that one or more lay Commissioners 
should  have  had  experience  of  having  suffered  at  the  hands  of  press  intrusion,  since 
individuals in this category might be expected to be biased the other way, or at least give rise 
to that appearance.47 Even so, without doubting the truth of Lord Grade’s evidence as to the 
full and frank exchange of views which attends the deliberations on the PCC’s adjudications 
in individual cases, I do not believe that it really addresses the structural problems I have

47 I acknowledge that three of the lay commissioners have recently submitted evidence that they or their families had 
in the past been the subject of press attention. However, there has been no suggestion that they were the subject of 
the kind of intrusive reporting which has proved most damaging to victims; and which the PCC failed to tackle 

1526

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJidentified. Lord Grade’s evidence would fail to persuade those who reasonably believe that 
the system is inherently weighted in favour of the status quo. Neither is this point to doubt 
the real value that I am sure lay Commissioners have brought to the process.

3.29  Refreshingly, some representatives of the press have accepted that the presence of serving 
editors on the PCC compromises its independence. For example, the editor of the Financial 
Times,  Lionel  Barber,  was  of  the  view  that  the  PCC  had  traditionally  contained  too  many 
serving editors:48

“It’s not a tenable position. We need outsiders. There have been some changes, but 
certainly for too long the PCC was dominated by insiders.”

3.30 

3.31 

I am not suggesting for one moment that the PCC should have been free from all industry 
expertise:  on  the  contrary,  this  always  would  have  been,  and  is,  invaluable.  But  industry 
expertise should have been drawn from a broader cohort and should not have been taken 
from serving editors of large national titles in competition with other national titles at all.49 
I have already said that serving or former journalists (including NUJ members) and retired 
editors would add a different perspective to the PCC board.50

I do not accept the argument that retired editors would necessarily be out of touch with 
developments in the industry.51 The broadcast media industry has, over the past 20 years, 
changed  with  extraordinary  speed.  The  rise  of  the  internet  and  media  convergence  has 
impacted upon broadcasters as well as newspapers. In spite of this, Ofcom has successfully 
employed the expertise of former journalists and media executives on its Board.52 There is no 
suggestion that those people have failed to understand or account for the acute changes and 
associated challenges which have affected the broadcast media. I emphasise that this is not 
to seek to compare the PCC with Ofcom or to hold one up against the other: it is simply to 
make the point that similar issues fall to be considered without the absence of serving editors 
being considered a disadvantage, still less an impediment.

3.32 

In my view, the constitution of the PCC Board is a limit on its independence. Serving editors, 
however dedicated to their role, are parti pris in relation to the outcome of adjudications in 
the sense I have identified, and are capable of influencing both the agenda and the course of 
debate in individual instances. Additionally, but outside the context of individual adjudications, 
the system is such that it creates at least the perception that the most powerful individuals 
on the PCC will direct overall strategy, policy and direction. Alastair Campbell put the point 
in this way:53

48 pp48-49, lines 25-2, Lionel Barber, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-
Morning-Hearing-10-January-2012.pdf 
49 The example is often given of doctors serving on Disciplinary Committees of the General Medical Council. If an ENT 
surgeon from, say, Newcastle, sits on a Disciplinary Committee in respect of an ENT surgeon whom he does not know 
and has had no contact with from, say, London, he will be able to bring his expertise to bear in a completely impartial 
way. If one of a dozen or so national editors sits on a PCC panel in relation to a competitive title, it is almost inevitable 
that he or she will know the editor extremely well and is likely to have a view about the balance of Articles 8 and 10: 
a complainant may well not feel that such an editor could be entirely impartial. As appears from the analysis of the 
position of Northern and Shell, the converse might also be true

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J“When I was in Downing Street, I was constantly told by PCC people that the three 
people who ’counted’ there were the chairman, Les Hinton and Paul Dacre.”

3.33 

I have no reason to doubt that this is what Mr Campbell was told by the ‘PCC people’ his witness 
statement admittedly did not identify. Whether or not they were speaking authoritatively, or 
accurately, perhaps does not matter; the concern is the perception which arises from the 
possibility for real power to be concentrated in a few hands.

The makeup of the Editors’ Code of Practice Committee

3.34  The Editors’ Code of Practice Committee, formally a sub-Committee of PressBoF rather than 
of the PCC, is responsible for the promulgation of the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice. A 
list of the current members of the Editors’ Code of Practice Committee is given in the witness 
statement of Stephen Abell.54 It wholly comprises serving editors and executives.

3.35  The PCC has been able to communicate its views on any amendments to the Editors’ Code 
of Practice, through the Chair or the Director. Although the formal role of the PCC Chair and 
Commissioners in relation to the Editors’ Code of Practice is advisory only, it has in practice 
been persuasive. One occasion when views were communicated was in the aftermath of the 
death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Lord Wakeham gave evidence that:55

“I persuaded the newspaper industry to strengthen its Code of Practice several times, 
including a wholesale revision, particularly on matters relating to privacy, following 
the death of the Princess of Wales in 1997.”

3.36  The Inquiry has also heard evidence that the PCC itself (through the Director or the Chair) was 
involved in feeding back ideas for improvements to the Editors’ Code from the coalface to the 
Editors’ Code Committee. There are examples of this in the documentation which the PCC 
has provided to the Inquiry. One such is a letter from Sir Christopher Meyer to Les Hinton, 
then Chairman of the Editors’ Code Committee, recommending improvements to clause 6 
of  the  Editors’  Code.56  On  other  occasions,  comments  on  the  Editors’  Code  from  external 
contributors were fed into the Editors’ Code Committee’s considerations.57

3.37  Public  involvement  in  the  contents  of  the  Editors’  Code  was,  however,  more  limited  and 
restricted  to  an  annual  consultation  session  undertaken  by  the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice 
Committee.  Beyond  this  and  the  limited  role  of  the  PCC,  control  over  the  Code  was  held 
entirely by the editors serving on the Code Committee.

3.38 

In  contrast,  although  a  statutory  code  (which  I  do  not  recommend)  as  a  matter  of  pure 
structure,  it  is  significant  that  the  Broadcasting  Code  is  drafted  by  Ofcom  employees  and 
approved by the Content Board, under delegated authority from the Ofcom Board. Suggestions 
are fed into Ofcom by stakeholders in the industry so that the Broadcasting Code develops in 
consultation with the industry and accounts for changing practices and industry challenges. 
Ed Richards, the Chief Executive of Ofcom, described the development of the Broadcasting 
Code in the following way:58

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ“…the way the code would work is so we review it from time to time… we try and 
update it in the light of practice. It would be drafted by full-time Ofcom employees, and 
it would then go through our decision-making process for approval, and in this case 
would be approved by our content board, which is where the hub of our broadcasting 
expertise lies. It could always, as with any Ofcom decision, be then referred upwards 
to the main board, but as I recall, I think this [current edition] would have been signed 
off by the content board in their delegated responsibilities.
DR BOWE: Yes.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Have you found it necessary … to involve actual programme 
makers or editors in the creation of this document?
MR RICHARDS: I would say that they are involved very closely in its evolution. We have 
a very close dialogue with actual programme makers, actual journalists, currently 
practising but also those for whom we can –those who we can draw on who are no 
longer practising but still have a deep well of expertise, and we draw on that very 
heavily. So just to underline the point, what does not happen is that half a dozen 
people  in  Ofcom  hide  in  a  room  and  write  a  code.  What  actually  happens  is  that 
those people talk on an open way over an extended period, test ideas, examine them, 
review them, and that process would involve working journalists, working producers, 
working editors, as well as those of – with previous experience, but the decision on 
the code would then be ours, and the decision would be made by the content board, 
so it’s incorporating, understanding latest practice and things of that nature, but the 
decision absolutely remains with us.”

3.39 

It is a clear flaw in the self-regulatory system that the Editors’ Code of Practice Committee, 
the body with sole authority to amend the Editors’ Code of Practice, is made up exclusively 
of  serving  editors  and  executives.  This  gives  rise  to  at  least  the  perception  that  rules  are 
being made which suit the editors themselves and not the public. Of course, as Mr Richards 
pointed out, a deep well of expertise is obviously necessary but what is also required is the 
involvement of a broader range of opinion to reflect all relevant constituencies.

Evidence of Northern and Shell witnesses

3.40  Witnesses from Northern & Shell gave evidence of their impression that the PCC was run by 
and for the benefit of a particular section of the press; this they gave as the principal reason 
for the January 2011 departure:59

“…we  came  into  it  seeing  the  sense  in  a  self-regulated  press,  and  we  thought  to 
ourselves we were able to regulate ourselves. There are a very large number of very 
good  reasons  why  a  newspaper  would  want  to  regulate  itself,  even  without  any 
industry body. We’d been used to doing that on magazines, so we knew of an Editors’ 
Code, and we saw no reason, in principle, why a company in isolation might not apply 
that Editors’ Code and put in its own disciplines and constraints.
The difference was the same code was being enforced, but it was a kind of an industry 
body that – it was a club.”

3.41  Underlying this answer may be both an element of special pleading and of personal acrimony 
between  those  at  the  head  of  Northern  &  Shell  and  those  who  they  perceive  as  running

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jthis  ‘club’.  From  their  perspective,  the  PCC  was  too  close  to  one  or  more  sections  of  the 
press, and Northern & Shell was relegated to the sidelines. I would not wish to comment on 
whether this perception articulated by Paul Ashford is substantiated, but its very existence 
does bear on the general issue of independence, the lack of which, and in particular from 
certain sections of the press, was also the reason given by Ian Hislop for Private Eye’s refusal 
to join the system of self-regulation in the first place.60

4.  The alignment with industry
4.1 

In  this  section  I  look  at  the  willingness  of  the  Press  Complaints  Commission,  as  putative 
regulator, to align its interests directly with those of the industry. At times, it seems that the 
PCC acted as both advocate and champion for this industry, a role that it rarely adopted in 
relation to those who had been wronged by the press. I will also examine and comment on 
the response of the PCC in response to criticism and its attitude towards the improvement of 
its structures and functions as well as calls from outside the industry for reform.

4.2 

4.3 

Advocacy of press industry interests
On occasion, the PCC acted as an unabashed advocate or lobbyist for the press industry. Some 
of this advocacy was directly in the commercial interests of the press. On other occasions, 
the PCC advanced the case for the self-regulatory system itself. Promoting self-regulation in 
principle, and the self-regulatory system as it was established in practice, may have created 
less obvious difficulties of perception than the promotion of the commercial interests of the 
regulated industry. However, as the preservation of the status quo was in at least the short 
term interests of the industry, promotion of the merits of self-regulation was an advancement 
of that interest. In my view, this served to create a real conflict of interest between the core 
function of the PCC, applying the Code and achieving a balance between the interests of the 
subjects of stories and the press, and the role it arrogated to itself in advocating the interests 
of the industry as a whole.

As has been make clear in earlier sections of the Report, in particular Part I Chapter 5 section 
3, Lord Wakeham intervened to influence the content of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), 
negotiating  with  the  then  Home  Secretary  the  Rt  Hon  Jack  Straw  MP  for  the  inclusion  of 
section  12  in  aid  of  the  press.61  Lord  Wakeham  was  clear  in  his  evidence  that  he  “never 
acted as a ‘representative of the press’”.62 He viewed himself instead as the representative 
of  self-regulation,  which  he  believed  would  be  undermined  by  the  passage  of  the  HRA.63 
However, he acknowledged in evidence that, while his primary concern was to protect the 
self-regulatory  system,  he  “did  in  [his]  speeches  make  some  more  general  observations 
about press freedom”.64 Lord Wakeham also acknowledged that representatives of the press,

“The Bill as drafted would damage the freedom of the press and badly wound the 
system of tough and effective self regulation that we have built up to provide quick 
remedies without cost for ordinary citizens. It would inevitably produce a privacy law, 
despite the Government’s stated opposition to one”

4.5 

The  Rt  Hon  Tony  Blair  gave  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  of  the  lobbying  undertaken  by  Lord 
Wakeham and the PCC more broadly intended to make plain the detrimental impact of the 
HRA on the press:67

“Q.  …The Human Rights Act, Mr Blair…Was it the position that News International – I 
suppose together with everybody else – were lobbying for complete press immunity 
from the Human Rights Act?
A.  Yes,  that’s  right.  They  wanted  no  suggestion  that  you  would  move  outside  the 
bounds of the PCC and self-regulation.
Q.  And were you generally supportive of that position?
A.  Yes, that was … my view was that if you were to deal with this, you had to deal 
with it head on, as it were, not through the Human Rights Act, which would be a 
sort of side way of dealing with it. Also, at that time, I think I’m right in saying it was 
Lord Wakeham who was head of the PCC, who was something actually I thought was 
doing quite a good job of that, and the PCC were pretty fierce on this, on behalf the 
whole of the media, really, not any one particular part of it.”

4.6 

Initially,  this  lobbying  was  intended  to  convince  the  Government  to  grant  the  press  an 
exemption  from  the  HRA.68  The  Government  was,  however,  according  to  Lord  Smith  of 
Finsbury,  “fundamentally  opposed”  to  any  such  exemption.69  In  the  event,  the  solution, 
negotiated by Lord Wakeham,70 between the press and the Government was described by 
Lord Smith thus:71

“In June of 1998, agreement was reached across government – and welcomed by 
the PCC – that a new clause would be brought forward for the Human Rights Bill: 
giving a steer on the need to respect the media’s right to freedom of expression as 
well as individuals’ rights to privacy; requiring the courts to have regard to the PCC 
Code of Practice and the broadcasting codes; and making it more difficult to obtain 
injunctions restraining publication”.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J4.7 

4.8 

The compromise reached was the insertion of what was to become section 12 HRA. Lord 
Wakeham described this as “the best compromise that was likely to have been achieved in the 
circumstances. It tried to tackle the issue of prior restraint and, in Jack Straw’s phrase in the 
House of Commons, ‘preserve[d] self regulation’”.72

The Human Rights Bill was not the only contemporaneous legislative matter to alarm the 
industry. Proposals in the Data Protection Bill were also a cause for concern. Lord Wakeham 
linked the two in a speech:73

“The thing that puzzles me is that the Data Protection Bill and the Human Rights Bill 
which this House has been considering seem to exist almost in different worlds, but 
the  truth  is  that  they  present  two  entirely  contradictory  sets  of  policies.  The  data 
protection bill does not introduce new powers for the rich and famous; the human 
rights bill does the opposite. The data protection bill does not introduce a back door 
privacy regime; the human rights bill does. The data protection bill safeguards the 
position of self-regulation. The human rights bill may end up undermining it.”

4.9 

The substance of Lord Wakeham’s objections here demonstrates the difficulty in distinguishing 
the  interests  of  the  press  and  the  interests  of  self-regulation.  I  have  no  doubt  that  Lord 
Wakeham, in lobbying the Home Secretary and other Ministers, believed that he was working 
in the interests of the self-regulatory system. However, Lord Wakeham’s interventions were 
couched not only in terms of protecting self-regulatory structures but also included warnings 
about the danger to the freedom of the press.

4.10  Lord Wakeham was not by any means the only leading member of the PCC to have been 
adept at the lobbying and influencing of politicians. When Guy (now Lord) Black resigned 
as Director of the PCC, Sir Christopher Meyer praised him for his skill in helping to influence 
Government policy in the interests of the self-regulatory system. In particular, Sir Christopher 
made reference to the role played by Lord Black in mitigating the impact of a number of pieces 
of legislation and for helping secure a benign political environment for self-regulation:74

“Since 1996 he has helped protect self regulation from the threats posed by numerous 
pieces of legislation including the Human Rights, Data Protection and Youth Justice 
Acts. And by making the PCC the efficient and effective body that it is today, Guy 
can rightly claim credit for the generally benevolent political attitude towards self-
regulation that we currently enjoy”.

4.11  The PCC actively sought to combat what it perceived as threats to the self-regulatory system. 
The  2003  Annual  Report  of  the  PCC  set  out  the  ‘external  threats’  facing  the  Commission. 
These included: discussions with European officials “to protect the special position of self-
regulation  in  the  UK”,75  as  well  as  proposals  for  amendment  of  the  Communications  Bill, 
which  could  have  brought  the  PCC  under  the  supervision  of  Ofcom,  and  Irish  legislators’ 
“plans to introduce a statutory press council there”.76 The PCC was particularly concerned at 
the potential impacts of proposals brought forward by the European Commission,77 and went 
so far as to engage a Brussels-based political consultant “to act, among other things, as an

self-regulation.”78

4.12 

In  2005,  the  PCC  coordinated  with  PressBoF  to  lobby  in  Europe  against  the  effect  of  the 
proposed Television Without Frontiers Directive. The then Director of the PCC, Tim Toulmin, 
wrote to the Secretary of PressBoF in the following terms:79

“My understanding is that the specific danger in the draft Directive is in its expectation 
that there will be regulations to ensure that:

•  there is a (statutory) right of reply to inaccuracies;
•  audio-visual  material  is  not  distributed  in  such  a  way  that  might  seriously 

impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors; and

•  audio-visual information does not contain incitement to hatred on the grounds 
of  sex,  racial  or  ethnic  origin,  religion  or  belief,  disability,  age  or  sexual 
orientation. “Incitement to hatred” is not defined.

These areas clearly touch on editorial content, particularly the first and third points, 
but  the  consultation  papers  only  suggest  explicitly  that  the  second  of  these  could 
be dealt with through self-regulation. Worryingly, the relevant paper states that in 
relation  to  the  proposed  rules  on  discrimination,  “some  stakeholders  argued  that 
co-regulation  or  self-regulation  would  be  inappropriate”,  and  there  is  no  further 
suggestion that self-regulation would be adequate.
The  broader  danger,  of  course,  is  that  unless  these  areas  are  carved  out  for  self-
regulation, the Directive will effectively have been a Trojan horse, with the regulation 
of at least some part of newspapers’ and magazines’ websites becoming for the first 
time the responsibility of other agencies (probably Ofcom). It can only be a matter 
of time before this precedent is used to argue for the harmonisation of regulation 
of broadcasters’ and publishers’ websites as media convergence continues. Ofcom, 
incidentally,  assures  us  that  it  has  no  ‘imperial’  ambitions  in  this  area,  and  the 
government appears to have taken a strong position against having to regulate the 
editorial content of websites – although it may of course have no choice eventually”.

4.13  Mr Toulmin’s letter is instructive. It is clear that the PCC was working with PressBoF to try to 
combat a perceived threat not only to the self-regulatory system but also more significantly 
to editorial freedom. It demonstrates that the PCC sought to influence legislation in a way 
which favoured the interests of the industry.

4.14  The  PCC  adopted  a  similar  advocatory  role  in  relation  to  discussions  concerning  the 
introduction  of  custodial  sentences  for  breach  of  s55  of  the  Data  Protection  Act.  On  this 
occasion, it was Sir Christopher Meyer who would play the lead role. Sir Christopher gave 
evidence that he could not recall any conversations with editors or other representatives of 
the press industry about the issue.80 However, he said that he thought it was appropriate for 
the PCC to campaign on this issue because “…it was something that we thought would be 
pretty chilling to freedom of expression”.81 In addition:82

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J“It  was  something  I  believed  in,  and  if  you  think  Mr  Dacre  picked  up  the  phone 
one day and said…“Very helpful if you stick in the annual review something about 
Section 55” – forget it. Even Jack Straw was on his side as well … and the Information 
Commissioner was rebuffed by the Lord Chancellor.
So it was not as if I was expressing some astonishing view. There was very wide public 
debate about this, and we decided to take part in it and why the hell not?”

4.15  Whether or not there were conversations between Sir Christopher and representatives of the 
press industry about the issue of custodial sentences for breach of s55 of the Data Protection 
Act, his action in respect of this issue on behalf of the organisation he chaired demonstrates 
that PCC thinking and priorities were very close (if not identical) to those of the industry it was 
supposed to regulate. Little consideration appears to have been given to those who might be 
the subject of intrusive breaches of data protection at the hands of the press without there 
being the slightest public interest in such breaches. Yet it is the complaints of those people 
which the PCC exists to mediate or resolve.

4.16 

It  is  not  clear  to  me  why  the  PCC  thought  it  either  necessary  or  appropriate  to  lobby 
Government on behalf of the press; it is not as if the press was devoid of its own powerful 
advocates.  It  is  apparent  from  Sir  Christopher’s  evidence  that  the  impulse  to  intervene 
stemmed from a prior belief that the principle of press freedom was at stake; and that this 
principle was something the PCC had a role in defending. I do not question the genuineness 
of Sir Christopher’s belief, although I have raised elsewhere my concerns as to whether it was 
well-founded. The point remains that in picking up the proverbial megaphone in this way, Sir 
Christopher was in danger of undermining public confidence in the ability or willingness of 
the PCC to act as an impartial and independent regulator through the clear alignment of the 
PCC with the interests of the industry.

Protective function of the PCC

4.17  There  appears  to  have  been  a  belief  among  some  sections  of  the  press  that  one  of  the 
functions of the PCC was to act as a shield protecting the press from criticism and litigation. 
The former editor of the Daily Express, Peter Hill, assigned as one of the main reasons for 
Northern & Shell’s decision to leave the PCC as the fact that the latter no longer prevented 
complainants from claiming through the courts.

4.18 

In 2009, Sir Christopher Meyer wrote to Richard Desmond in an attempt to persuade the 
Northern and Shell group to remain in the self-regulatory system. He wrote:83

“…now  that  the  Express  has  withdrawn  from  the  NPA,  it  would  be  helpful  to  talk 
about how we can keep the papers within the PCC system. The benefits to newspapers 
of  subscribing  to  the  scheme  are  numerous:  sorting  out  complaints  through  us 
(particularly  about  privacy  matters)  minimises  the  risk  of  cripplingly  expensive 
court cases and legal settlements; it delivers opt-outs for journalists from numerous 
pieces  of  legislation  such  as  the  Investment  Recommendation  Regulations;  and  it 
keeps the government from legislating on the areas that the press Code of Practice 
covers. In fact, last year – when the public used our services in record numbers – the 
Government, Opposition and the Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport all 
came out in favour of self-regulation. I know that the subscription to the PCC is not 
cheap – around £167k per annum – but I strongly believe that the costs of staying 
outside the system, particularly in legal fees, would be much higher.”

1534

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ4.19 

In a similar vein, the 2010 financial review (drafted by the then Director of the PCC, Stephen 
Abell) made the following observation:84

“A successful PCC is, as everyone recognises, in the interests of the industry, both in 
terms of staving off statutory regulation and limiting the flow of people to use the 
courts. The better the service the PCC can offer, the better value it is to the industry.”

4.20  The maintenance of the system of self-regulation through the PCC and, therefore by implication, 
the ability of the PCC to shield the industry from litigation, was often cited by the PCC as 
a  reason  for  newspapers  to  comply  with  PCC  adjudications  and  decisions.  Sir  Christopher 
wrote in February 2007 to Colin Myler, then the editor of the NoTW, to arraign Mr Myler 
for not having given sufficient prominence to a PCC adjudication. Sir Christopher wrote: “I 
was particularly surprised at this oversight given the current context of renewed scrutiny of 
self-regulation”.85 The implication of this is clear: failure to comply with PCC decisions risked 
questions being asked of the self-regulatory system itself.

4.21 

A pattern of cosmetic reform
In other parts of this Report, most particularly in Part D Chapter 1, I fully address the history 
of press self-regulation. As I said on several occasions during the oral sessions this has been 
characterised by a cyclical pattern of (i) crisis, (ii) the press coming under heavy public and 
some political pressure, (iii) some reforms, usually of a limited nature, being carried out, (iv) 
ephemeral  improvement,  (v)  deterioration  in  press  behaviour,  and  ultimately  (vi)  another 
crisis. As I made clear above,86 the reforms introduced by the industry have not addressed 
the structural problems which this Part of the Report serves to identify. Put another way, 
limited programmes of reform have been concerned with relieving pressure on the press, and 
blunting calls for strengthening the self-regulatory system. A show of reform has been used 
as a substitute for the reality of it.

4.22  Part  D  Chapter  1  looked  at  the  history  of  self-regulation  until  2003  which  was  when  Sir 
Christopher Meyer took over as Chair of the PCC. I will therefore pick up the narrative from 
then.

4.23 

In  a  speech  delivered  on  6  May  2003,  approximately  six  weeks  into  his  tenure  as  Chair, 
Sir  Christopher  announced  a  programme  of  reform  which  he  described  as  “permanent 
evolution”.87 It was intended as a process of self-examination and improvement with a view 
to providing a better service to the public that would be applied not only to the PCC but the 
self-regulatory structure more broadly.88

4.24  The first measures introduced as part of the ‘permanent evolution’ programme related to the 
independence of the Commission itself. The number of public members of the Commission 
was increased to ten (from nine) against seven editorial members.89 Also, the recruitment 
process for public members was changed so that positions were advertised, and prospective 
members  were  interviewed  by  an  independent  panel  before  the  final  interview  with  Sir 
Christopher and another member of the PCC.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J4.25  As I noted earlier, the fact that lay members formed a majority on the Commission has been 
repeatedly relied upon by the PCC and its supporters as evidence of the independence of the 
self-regulatory system from the industry. Putting one more lay member on the Commission 
appears to be a step towards achieving greater independence for the decision-making body, 
but it was far from being a radical one; the positive impact, if any, is far from clear. This was 
very much more a cosmetic move towards independence than a substantive one.

4.26  The  programme  of  ‘permanent  evolution’  also  saw  the  introduction  of  the  Charter 
Commissioner  and  the  Charter  Compliance  panel.  In  the  PCC’s  2004  Annual  Report,  the 
role of the Charter Commissioner was described as providing “an internal ‘judicial review’ 
mechanism”.90 This is not a helpful or accurate description. The Charter Commissioner and 
Charter Compliance Panel did not have the power to overturn PCC decisions. They did not 
examine whether decisions of the PCC were reasonable, even in the rather more limited sense 
permitted  by  judicial  review.  Rather,  they  examined  whether  the  PCC’s  service  standards 
met their targets; if the review found a procedural defect, it could ask the PCC to revisit a 
decision.91

4.27  What  these  two  bodies  offered  was  effectively  an  enhanced  customer-service  complaints 
body and nothing more. To imply, by describing the powers of the Charter Commissioner 
and  Charter Compliance  Panel  in  the  language of  judicial  review, that  they had  any more 
substantial function, or offered the reassurance of oversight of the PCC’s activities, is entirely 
wrong;  they  were  little  more  than  window-dressing.92  Taken  as  a  whole,  the  package  of 
reforms introduced under Sir Christopher’s ‘permanent evolution’ did not address, and were 
not intended to address, the substantive problems with the system of self-regulation. These 
limited reforms may well have given the appearance of activity and development but did little 
more than that.

4.28  Nor did the PCC move to address in any meaningful sense the concerns raised by revelations 
of mobile phone voicemail hacking by journalists working at the NoTW in 2006. Following 
the completion of the PCC’s Report into Subterfuge and Newsgathering in May 2007 (dealt 
with  in  more  detail  below),  the  PCC  made  recommendations  to  newspapers  about  steps 
they  might  take  in  order  to  comply  with  the  existing  rules  in  relation  to  data  protection, 
subterfuge and news gathering.93 In August 2007, Clause 10 of the Editors’ Code of Practice 
(relating to subterfuge and newsgathering) was revised to prohibit the unauthorised removal 
of documents or photographs and the accessing of digitally-held private information without 
consent. In addition, Clause 10(ii) was changed so that the provisions in relation to public 
interest  justifications  for  subterfuge  and  misrepresentations  extended  to  the  activities  of 
third parties.94

4.29  When she took over as the Chair of the PCC, Baroness Buscombe planned an independent 
review of the PCC’s governance, remit, sanctions, budget and the degree of independence it 
enjoyed from the industry.95 This became the Independent Governance Review, which was

and Charter Compliance Panel went about the work: my concern is the limit of their power and responsibility

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJset up in August 2009 and reported in July 2010. Despite the planned scope of the project, 
the governance review which followed was altogether more limited in its scope:96

“…the  industry  was  very  clear  that  a  review  undertaken  by  the  PCC  should  only 
consider  issues  solely  within  its  remit.  Questions  as  to  funding,  independence  and 
sanctions were decidedly off limits”.

4.30  The  Independent  Governance  Review  made  75  separate  recommendations.  According  to 
Stephen  Abell,  former  Director  of  the  PCC,  the  key  reforms  which  eventuated  principally 
comprised:97

“A proper statement of aims and duties were to be published by the PCC;

An  enhanced  register  of  interests  would  be  published  to  inform  the  public  of  any 
conflicts of interest which Commissioners might have;

A public commissioner would be appointed Deputy Chairman of the PCC;

New performance objectives would be introduced to measure the success of the PCC’s 
work;

A new website would be launched to improve access to complaint statistics, PCC case 
law and complaint-making facilities;

Commissioners would be updated weekly on the day-to-day activities of the PCC’s 
staff; and

The PCC would establish working groups to consider questions arising from public 
concern or complaint trends.”

4.31  Other  recommendations  included  changing  the  name  of  the  Charter  Commissioner  and 
Charter  Compliance  Panel  to  the  Independent  Reviewer  and  Review  Panel  respectively.98 
None of these changes addressed the fundamental weaknesses of the self-regulatory system. 
Nor did the reforms make the PCC, or the wider self-regulatory system, more independent of 
the press. There were limited moves towards further independence, manifest in the greater 
involvement of the lay members of the PCC in the appointments process, but given the real 
constraints on of the independence of the PCC set out at the head of this Chapter, the effect 
of this was negligible and served only to allow the impression that a process of reform was 
underway.

4.32 

I deal with the substantive detail of the PCC’s investigations into phone hacking elsewhere in 
this Chapter. However, there is value, in the context of the limited and partial attempts at reform 
made by the PCC, in making some comments about its response to the allegations. Baroness 
Buscombe gave evidence that she felt pressure to launch an investigation into allegations of 
phone hacking at the NoTW in 2009 in order to reassure the public that something was being 
done by the regulator.99 It may be that the PCC’s general approach to the public presentation 
of itself owed much to the bonds which Baroness Buscombe identified in this instance.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J4.33 

It was only following the sustained public outcry in response to continued revelations of phone 
hacking that the PCC announced that it intended to address the fundamental weaknesses in 
self-regulatory system. In a press release published on 6 July 2011, after the Guardian had 
published its article alleging that Milly Dowler’s phone messages had been hacked, the PCC 
announced a review of self-regulation to be carried out by lay members of the Commission. 
The remit was to:100

“[a] review of all aspects of press regulation in its current form, which will be designed 
to ensure that public confidence is enhanced. The Commission will wish to review its 
own constitution and funding arrangements, the range of sanctions available to it, 
and its practical independence.”

4.34  The proposal is in marked contrast to previous efforts at self-reflection, which had failed to 

ask pertinent questions about self-regulation and had led only to cosmetic changes.

4.35  The self-presentation of the PCC as a competent regulator with adequate powers perpetuated 
the unsatisfactory status quo. The PCC gave the public a false impression of what it could do 
and never acknowledged the limitations of its powers. Through acquiescent silence, the PCC 
permitted policy-makers and the public to make mistaken assumptions about the breadth 
and depth of the powers and capacity of self-regulation. It is damning of the PCC that it was 
only when the system of regulation was under unprecedented scrutiny and extreme threat, 
that a programme of reform was announced that asked questions of import directed squarely 
at the system’s failings.

Restrictions on the PCC’s ability to reform itself

4.36  Linked to the apparent unwillingness of the PCC to implement meaningful reform were real 
restrictions on the ability to undertake reform. The PCC was not permitted by the industry to 
examine, reflect and then act on its own performance. The evidence of Baroness Buscombe 
in this respect is instructive. At the beginning of her tenure as Chair of the PCC, Baroness 
Buscombe was convinced that the PCC was sufficiently independent from the press and that 
the system did not require substantial reform.101 In a speech delivered on 15 November 2009, 
she  expressed  strong  support  in  principle  for  the  self-regulatory  system  and  in  particular 
sought to rebut criticism that the PCC was not independent from the regulated industry:102

“The  press  do  not  regulate  themselves.  The  PCC  is  funded  by  the  newspaper  and 
magazine industry but operates independently of it. Is independence is guaranteed 
by a majority of lay members, and staff who have no vested interest in siding with the 
press. Is that really so difficult to grasp?”

4.37  However, Baroness Buscombe reassessed her view of the independence of the PCC from the 
industry. Shortly before the instigation of the Independent Governance Review, she felt much 
more  constrained  in  the  PCC’s  approach  to  this  task.  In  evidence,  she  referred  in  general 
terms to the limitations imposed on her by ‘the industry’, making clear that she was required 
to entertain only those issues covered by the PCC’s terms of reference:103

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ“My view changed…in that I realised fairly soon after I arrived that of course I was in a 
very different world in terms of the self-regulatory system as it applies within the press 
and magazine industry than as it applies within the ASA … In the ASA environment, 
there was no micro-managing. The role of the equivalent to PresBoF was very much 
hands off, except for being a funding mechanism and being there to be supportive of 
the ASA system.
…
It was terribly important for us to demonstrate … that actually this Commission …
[ was] an entirely separate part of the industry. But I also … found in practice it was 
difficult to be independent when I realised that in order to improve our credibility, 
to continue what Christopher Meyer I know has called an evolution – I wanted a bit 
more of a permanent revolution … to really improve the governance and structures 
of the organisation and to try to put pressure, if I could, with the permission and 
blessing of the Commission, on the industry to accept that … we needed to up our 
game in terms of our remit, our sanctions and very much our funding. This is where 
my view of independence changed.
Q.  So  is  the gist  of  your  evidence this,  Lady  Buscombe: that  you  were keen for  … 
revolutionary change, but you were facing resistance from the industry against such 
change?
A.  Yes, and that was not at the outset … My issue was with the – those who were in 
charge of giving us permission, as it were, where we sought it, to try and improve our 
funding, improve our resource overall so we could do a better job”.

Defensive attack and failure to reform

4.38  Representatives of the PCC have tended to reject criticism, and on occasions have made ad 
hominem attacks on their critics, sometimes in intemperate terms. Over time the PCC has 
reacted strongly to well-informed criticism or what it perceived to be criticism from, amongst 
others, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC who was the last Chairman of the Press Council; the Media 
Standards  Trust;  and  the  journalists  John  Simpson  and  Nick  Davies.104  Typically,  criticism 
was repudiated on the basis that the critic had failed to understand the nature of the self-
regulatory system and/or had not placed adequate weight on the importance of freedom of 
expression.

4.39 

I  draw  attention  to  only  two  examples  in  this  regard.  First,  in  February  2009  the  Media 
Standards  Trust  published  its  report,  A  More  Accountable  Press.  Part  1:  The  Need  for 
Reform.105 In my view, this is a measured and punctilious critique of the PCC, justified on the 
then available evidence and made more prescient by subsequent events. On 19 February 
2009, Sir Christopher Meyer wrote to Mr Salz of the Media Standards Trust making a number 
of observations, including the following:106

“I am afraid that we also require some reassurance about the credentials of those 
carrying out the inquiry. In addition to the inaccuracies ... the report does not appear 
to have been written by anyone with much understanding of self-regulation or the

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jrelationship  between  the  PCC  and  the  law.  More  fundamentally,  we  have  to  ask 
ourselves whether this enterprise is being undertaken in good faith...”

4.40  Further, on 4 March 2009 the Director of the PCC wrote an internal memorandum to all the 

Commissioners, which included the following statements:107

“As  we  have  maintained  throughout,  the  report  is  little  more  than  a  ‘case  for  the 
prosecution’ ... The question is why they are doing this. To answer this, it is important 
to understand who these people are, and what the genesis of the Media Standards 
Trust is. For, while it sounds like an impressive official body, the MST is, in reality, no 
more than a private pressure group of like-minded people who met on a weekend 
retreat a few years ago – under the aegis of something called ‘Common Purpose’ 
–  and  decided  that  ‘something  must  be  done’  about  the  popular  press.  One  can 
therefore surmise that their preferred way of achieving this is to replace the PCC with 
something that will be more restrictive...”

4.41  Second, in its 2003 report on Privacy and Media Intrusion, the House of Commons Culture, 
Media and Sport (CMS) Select Committee made a number of recommendations in relation to 
the PCC. Specifically, it recommended that the PCC Code prohibit payments to the police. It 
also recommended that there be a ban on newspapers using third parties or intermediaries 
to access private information about people.108

4.42  The  PCC  did  not  act  on  these  recommendations.  Sir  Christopher  Meyer  gave  evidence  in 
relation to the first of these matters. He has said that the making of payments to the police 
was  already  a  breach  of  the  criminal  law.109  However,  this  rather  simplistic  explanation 
overlooks the fact that the codes of other regulators routinely reflect that prohibited conduct 
may also amount to a violation of the criminal law. Perhaps more tellingly, the Editors’ Code 
of Practice itself contains provisions (eg clause 13 of the Code, relating to financial journalism) 
the breach of which might well also constitute a violation of the criminal law.

4.43  Furthermore, as subsequently addressed in Section 7 below, the Code explicitly covers issues 
concerning subterfuge and mobile phone voicemail hacking which engage the criminal law. 
Finally, given the information provided to the CMS Select Committee,110 there was at least 
some evidence to suggest that newspapers were paying the police. It therefore rather misses 
the point to say that the existence of a criminal provision obviated the need for the Editors’ 
Code of Practice to proscribe a particular practice.

4.44 

In relation to the second recommendation, no action was taken. Sir Christopher could not 
recall whether this second recommendation was discussed with the Commission.111 Certainly, 
no such ban was implemented. Sir Christopher, spoke to the attitude of the PCC in this respect 
in evidence:112

Committee  recommended.  You’ll  find  other  recommendations  in  other  Select 
Committee reports where we haven’t necessarily adopted what they recommended.”

4.45  Whilst  it  is  clear  that  the  PCC  was  indeed  under  no  obligation  to  implement  Select 
Committee recommendations, in the circumstances greater consideration of the merits of 
the recommendations would have been advisable, as well as being more appropriate to an 
organisation that took its duties as regulator seriously.

5.  The PCC as regulator
5.1 

In this section of the Report, I examine the issue of the PCC as regulator and examine by turns 
the perception and reality of the functions of the PCC in that regard. I look at and comment 
on the structural issues that prevented the PCC from functioning as a regulator, and left it as 
little more than a complaints handling body.

5.2 

A fundamental failing: the PCC was not a regulator
It is abundantly clear from the evidence before the Inquiry that the PCC was not a regulator 
as that term is commonly understood. It is though perhaps surprising to many of those who 
have followed the proceedings of this Inquiry that this perception of the PCC has been shared 
and articulated by some of the most prominent witnesses speaking on behalf of the self-
regulatory system.113 Lord Black, now Chairman of PressBoF and formerly Director of the PCC, 
gave evidence that “I never believed the PCC to be a regulator”.114

5.3 

Lord Wakeham, who was Chair of the PCC from 1995 to 2001, told the Inquiry:115

“I was always clear that my task was not to be a ‘regulator’ – the PCC never had 
formal regulatory powers – but to endeavour to raise standards in the press above 
the  minimum  required  by  law  through  a  process  of  education,  exhortation  and 
adjudication”.

5.4 

That said, his position was that the PCC had taken on more features of a regulator:116

“Over the years, [the PCC] has added on functions that are of a more regulatory nature 
without its structures or remit being amended accordingly. Most of this happened 
in the last few years, culminating in the disastrous report on phone hacking. I also 
suspect that the PCC’s Governance Review – with which I was not impressed – tried 
to remodel it as a regulatory quango, far removed from its original mission, or its 
powers  or  expertise,  and  with  little  understanding  of  the  nature  of  the  publishing 
industry.”

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J5.5 

Of  the  former  Chairs  of  the  PCC  who  have  given  evidence  to  the  Inquiry,  Sir  Christopher 
Meyer is alone in advancing the view that the PCC was a regulator.117 He said that:118

5.6 

5.7 

5.8 

5.9 

“…the press in the United Kingdom is regulated by a hybrid system, which is partly 
by law and partly through the implementation of the code of practice of the PCC. So 
what I understood...and still do, by ‘self-regulation’ was the system which worked 
through the PCC.”

In my view, Sir Christopher was utterly mistaken to characterise the PCC as a regulator or 
the  press  as  a  regulated  industry.  The  PCC  lacked  the  structural  independence  from  the 
press; and the power, the armoury of sanctions or the resources to be a regulator properly 
so-called. PCC is better characterised as a complaints and mediation service. Nor did it fulfil 
the function of operating as a standards watchdog within the industry which any regulator 
properly described would have done.

I  do  not  condemn  Sir  Christopher  for  labouring  under  this  misapprehension.  The  PCC 
deliberately and consistently presented itself as the de facto regulator. This is not a matter of 
semantics or opinion but rather of fact. The PCC website, the access point to the Commission 
for the general public, makes clear in plain English that the PCC is the self-regulator for the 
press. In this context, it is not necessarily surprising that Sir Christopher was, in this respect, in 
a minority of one. The candid admissions of Lord Black and Lord Wakeham might be thought 
more surprising given the public presentation of the PCC.

Despite  the  obvious  deficiencies  in  its  constitution  and  make  up,  the  PCC  and  PressBoF 
presented the self-regulatory system as a whole as if it were a regulator. This self-presentation 
took  the  form  both  of  explicit  assertions  and  the  deliberate  adoption  of  the  language  of 
regulation  in  the  description  of  its  functions  and  powers.  The  effect  of  this  was  two-fold. 
First, it helped to reinforce the perception that the press was subject to an effective system of 
regulation, as the casual or even the interested observer was capable of being misled, since 
the distinction between the PCC as it was and as it was claimed to be would tend to be elided 
in the public mind. Second, the over-statement of its powers weakened the arguments for 
reform.

Examples of this form of self-promotion are legion in the evidence heard by the Inquiry, but I 
will set out a handful. In 2005, Sir Christopher gave a speech to the Society of Editors in which 
he said that the PCC was, by that stage, so independent that it was questionable whether 
self-regulation was any longer the correct way of describing it. He said that the PCC was “the 
creature that broke free from its creators”.119 The clear implication of this speech was that the 
PCC had reached a level of effectiveness and independence which meant that it was better 
than its original conception.

5.10  This misleading self-presentation continued even after the failings and powerlessness of the 
PCC  had  been  laid  bare.  As  recently  as  August  2011,  Professor  Julian  Petley,  Professor  of 
Screen Media and Journalism at Brunel University, wrote an article on the New Left Project 
website, the substance of which was to argue that the PCC was not and never had been a 
regulator, and would better be described as a mediator.120 The PCC posted a rebuttal to this

newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/press_regulation_now_theres_an_idea 

1542

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJarticle on its website, which included the following passage in which little room was left for 
misinterpretation:121

“Julian Petley is obviously wrong to try to characterise the PCC as merely a mediator 
and not a regulator. He is wrong to suggest there is nothing in the PCC’s Articles of 
Association to suggest it performs a regulatory function when those articles actually 
specifically state that the PCC has responsibility to: ‘consider and pronounce on issues 
relating  to  the  Code  of  Practice  which  the  Commission,  in  its  absolute  discretion 
considers to be in the public interest’.”

5.11  Similarly, the press release announcing the appointment of Lord Hunt of Wirral as the new 
Chairman of the PCC declared that he was to oversee the regeneration and renewal of the 
system of non-statutory regulation of the press.122

5.12 

In addition to this explicit self-description as a regulator, the PCC also used language to describe 
its  powers  and  functions  that  gave  the  impression  that  it  was  more  potent  than  it  really 
was. The PCC routinely talked about its ‘powers,’ for example in relation to its investigations 
or  sanctions.  The  PCC  said  that  it  carried  out  ‘investigations’  into  complaints,  as  if  it  had 
specific investigatory powers or the capacity to do more than correspond with contacts inside 
the newspaper. In this respect the PCC projected the impression that it possessed powers, 
competence, status and capacity which it did not.

5.13  There was also an implicit representation that the PCC was exercising regulatory functions 
when it accepted responsibility for investigating high-profile scandals involving the printed 
media, most notably phone hacking. In announcing its investigation into the allegations on 
1 February 2007, the PCC committed itself not only to asking questions of the NoTW editor 
Colin  Myler,  but  also  to  ascertaining  what  steps  other  newspapers  had  taken  to  prevent 
similar activities from taking place elsewhere. The PCC also committed itself to publishing 
a “review of the current situation, with recommendations for best practice if necessary, in 
order to prevent a similar situation arising in the future. This is in line with [the PCC’s] duty to 
promote high professional standards of journalism”.123

5.14  The press release set out steps which might be expected of a typical regulator; in particular 
the initiation of an investigation, taking steps to discover what prophylactic measures were 
being taken by particular media groups, and the promotion of standards of conduct within 
the industry. The press release of 1 February 2007 did not admit to any limitations in the 
capacity of the PCC to investigate, and was therefore apt to raise expectations unnecessarily. 
As I make clear in Section 7 below, the PCC’s deficient powers impacted directly on the validity 
and credibility of that report. The lack of regulatory authority also severely constrained what 
the PCC could do in relation to concerns around data protection breaches, as I examine in 
more detail below.

5.15  At this juncture it is pertinent to note the evidence I have heard that has directly linked the 
credibility and efficacy of the PCC to the person and authority of the Chair. David Yelland, the 
former editor of The Sun, said that he took the provisions of the Editors’ Code of Practice 
seriously “partly because of the respect I had for Lord Wakeham, the then PCC Chair”.124 The 
personal authority and diplomatic skills of Lord Wakeham, in particular, served to camouflage 
a number of structural weaknesses which prevented the PCC from operating as a robust and 
independent regulator.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J6.  Structural problems with the PCC

Non-universal membership

6.1  Membership of the PCC has never been compulsory for publications. Some publications and 
media groups, for example, the Northern & Shell Group and the satirical magazine Private Eye, 
have concluded that it is not in their interests to participate in the system of self-regulation. 
Northern & Shell left the self-regulatory structure for a second time in January 2011, although 
its titles still abide by the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice. Private Eye has never joined 
the self-regulatory structure.

6.2 

Baroness Buscombe recognised the lack of compulsory membership as a weakness in the PCC 
system,125 as also did the former Director Stephen Abell.126 Lord Black said that:127

6.3 

6.4 

“PressBoF recognises that this is a weakness in the system, and part of the price we 
pay for maintaining voluntary membership. We have done everything we can to bring 
Northern and Shell back into the system, and continue to do so”.

Lord Black’s answer raises a number of issues. First, insofar as Lord Black may be suggesting 
that the price ‘we pay’ is an acceptable one, I entirely disagree. This is a fundamental weakness 
in the system and must be acknowledged as such, as indeed should the ineffective nature of 
PressBoF’s efforts to persuade Northern and Shell to re-join, recognising as I do that Lord Black 
and his co-Directors made considerable efforts in this regard. Further, it should be recorded 
that having accepting Lord Black’s assurances that every effort was being made to resolve the 
issue, Baroness Buscombe did not seek to persuade the Northern & Shell Group back into 
the self-regulatory fold after the departure of the group for a second time in January 2011.128 
Whilst the PCC has never been able to offer redress to complainants across the whole range 
of publications, this situation has been significantly exacerbated by the position in relation 
to Northern and Shell. Although the PCC may still technically have at least 90% coverage, this 
state of affairs is manifestly unsatisfactory.

There are a number of further issues that link to the voluntary nature of membership and 
the  lack  of  appropriate  incentives  to  maintain  membership.  Perhaps  most  significantly,  if 
an editor disliked a particular decision by or approach of the PCC, newspapers could make 
credible threats to leave the self-regulatory system. Although there were a number of factors 
behind the decision of Northern & Shell to leave the PCC, one particular factor identified by 
witnesses for Northern & Shell was the public criticism by Sir Christopher Meyer of Peter Hill , 
the editor of the Daily Express, in light of the coverage by the newspaper of the disappearance 
of Madeleine McCann.129 Whether that criticism should have been couched differently is not 
the point: rather the implications of the ability of editors to react to criticism from the PCC in 
this way are real.

6.7 

6.8 

It  cannot  but  have  shaped  the  relationship  between  the  PCC  and  the  industry  that  both 
sides knew that newspapers could opt out of the system if they chose. Baroness Buscombe 
gave  evidence  that  during  her  tenure  as  Chair,  three  editors  threatened  to  leave  the  PCC 
as a consequence of adverse adjudications.130 I acknowledge that her version of events has 
been questioned by the editors concerned, but the point of principle remains: the loss of any 
editor would naturally be seriously damaging to the effectiveness and reputation of the PCC. 
Baroness Buscombe acknowledged that it was a weakness of the system:131

“It is possible for news organisations to register the threat of withdrawing from the 
system following the issuing of decisions against them. I have been made aware of 
this in my time as Chairman, although it has never been acted upon. However, it does 
reveal a potential fragility in the system”.

The Chair of the PCC, the Director and Commissioners were well aware of the substantial 
negative impact which the departure of a major newspaper group could have on the credibility 
of the system of self-regulation. It is hard to think that the need to avoid such a catastrophe 
did not influence the thinking of these people, committed as they were to the preservation 
of self-regulation. At the very least, the fact that an editor could make a credible threat to 
leave on behalf of his or her title would give a reasonable and well-informed observer cause 
to believe that the PCC might seek to avoid criticising newspapers too often or too heavily, for 
fear of the consequences to the system of self-regulation.

Investigating complaints
The  PCC  has  very  limited  power  to  investigate  complaints.  In  particular,  it  does  not  have 
the power to compel parties to produce documents or any other evidence in support of, or 
capable of contradicting, their account of events. The PCC does not have the power to ask for 
sworn evidence. There is no sanction for an individual who misleads the PCC, tells half-truths 
or fails to answer the PCC’s questions.

A  PCC  investigation  into  a  complaint  typically  involves  the  complaints  officer  contacting  a 
newspaper to ask for its version of the events or justification for the content at the heart of 
the complaint. There then follows correspondence between the PCC complaints officer and 
a contact at the newspaper, typically the newspaper’s legal department or managing editor’s 
office.132 The PCC does not demand documents or other evidence in support of the positions 
adopted  by  the  parties,  although  parties  might  voluntarily  supply  these.  Complainants 
have access to all material submitted by newspapers in support of their accounts, but do 
not  necessarily  have  access  to  the  correspondence  between  a  complaints  officer  and  the 
newspaper.133 The PCC does not request statements from the journalists who researched and 
wrote stories.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J6.9 

If the PCC is to reach fair decisions, it is reliant on editors and complainants not only telling the 
truth but providing a full, fair and balanced account. It has been made clear during the course 
of this Inquiry that when the PCC twice investigated phone hacking this was not the case, as 
more fully addressed below. It is impossible to say for certain that they were misled on other 
occasions, but given how many cases the PCC dealt with every year it would be surprising 
if they were always given the entire picture or told the whole truth. It cannot be the case 
that entering into correspondence with an editor, or with a legal department or managing 
editor’s office in this way, is tantamount to an investigation in any meaningful sense. Similarly, 
anyone aware these of the limitations would question whether the PCC was really capable of 
obtaining facts and coming to safe conclusions about the merits of a complaint.134

6.10  On occasion, the lack of investigatory powers meant that the PCC could not resolve a dispute 
between  parties.  This  happens  when  the  accounts  provided  by  the  two  sides  cannot  be 
reconciled; thus, no negotiated settlement can be reached. The former Director of the PCC 
Tim Toulmin gave the following account of this type of finding:135

“There’s a rare category of ruling called ‘no finding’ which occasionally the PCC would 
deploy … but almost always it was possible to reach an outcome whereby, if there 
was something wrong, it would be put right.”

6.11  Even if a ‘no finding’ ruling was rare, it is highly unsatisfactory that such a result should ever 
come about; a dispute about the facts leaves a title effectively exonerated (there being no 
adverse finding) and no mechanism for a complainant to obtain redress. It is also illustrative 
of the weakness of the system. Some newspaper figures have recognised that the lack of any 
real investigatory powers was a failing. The editor of the Financial Times, Lionel Barber, said 
that in his view a replacement body for the PCC needed to have the power to investigate and 
with this I wholeheartedly concur.136

Powers the PCC did not exercise – investigations without a 
complaint and third party complaints

6.12  Subject to a small number of refinements set out in evidence by Lord Hunt during the course 
of  Module  Four,  which  I  address  further  below,  the  PCC  has  only  investigated  complaints 
which  come  from  the  person  affected  by  an  article  or  investigation.  Baroness  Buscombe 
said that, in some cases, third party complaints may receive a response as the PCC does on 
occasion seek to contact a directly affected party and progress the complaint.137

6.13  The source of the general practice of the PCC in this respect is Article 53.3(a) of the Articles 

of Association which govern it:138

“53.3  A complaint may be made by an individual or by a body of persons (whether 
incorporated or not) but, in addition to the requirements of Article 53.1, shall only be 
entertained or its consideration proceeded with if it appears to the Commission that:

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJthe complaint is made by the person affected or by a person authorised by him to 
make the complaint”.

6.14  However, the PCC does have a discretion to investigate where there is no complaint from the 

directly affected party:139

“53.4  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Article  53.3,  the  Commission  shall 
have  discretion  to  consider  any  complaint  from  whatever  source  that  it  considers 
appropriate to the effective discharge of its function.”

6.15  As a linked issue, Article 53.1A provides:140

“It  shall  also  be  the  function  of  Commission  to  consider  and  pronounce  on  issues 
relating  to  the  Code  of  Practice  which  the  Commission  in  its  absolute  discretion 
considers to be in the public interests [sic]”.

6.16  The difference between these sub-Articles is probably one of degree. On my interpretation 
of these provisions (which certainly could be clearer), the PCC has a broad residual power 
to entertain third-party complaints as it sees fit, although no guidance is supplied as to the 
type of circumstance which might trigger the discretion. Further, Article 53.4 has to be read 
in  conjunction  with  Article  53.7,141  which  is  heavily  weighted  in  favour  of  what  might  be 
described as Article 10 (as opposed to Article 8) rights as set out in the EHCR.142

6.17  As for Article 53.1A, the Commission’s discretion under this provision does not presuppose 
the making of any complaint, third party or otherwise. It is a potentially wide-ranging, roving 
power, which enables the PCC to issue guidance and carry out investigations to the extent 
that issues relate to the Editors’ Code of Practice. The scope of this latter investigatory power 
is uncertain: the reference to the Editors’ Code of Practice clearly requires the identification 
of some sort of issue as regards either the interpretation or application of the Code. Whilst 
these  are  fluid  matters,  the  discretion  of  the  PCC  is,  in  any  event,  ‘absolute’.  I  have  seen 
evidence that suggests that this Article appears to have been used a number of times by 
the PCC, most notably in the two investigations into phone hacking in 2007 and 2009. I use 
the  verb  ‘appears’  because  Article  53.1A  has  not  been  specifically  invoked  by  the  PCC  in 
this context. There does not appear to have been a clear or consistent policy applied to the 
exercise of this discretion.

6.18 

In this regard the evidence of Lord Wakeham and of Tim Toulmin about the investigation 
of third party complaints illustrates the attitude of both the PCC and the industry to such 
complaints.  Lord  Wakeham  suggested  that  following  his  appointment  as  Chair,  there  was 
pressure from the industry to prevent third parties from complaining about stories which did 
not directly affect them:143

“…when I got there, the Press Council [sic] had fallen into considerable disrepute with 
the press for one reason – one of the reasons was that a whole lot of people were

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jmaking a lot of complaints and many of them are pretty frivolous …. and they did say 
the Press Complaints Commission is there to deal with people’s complaints who have 
an interest in the complaint, a proper interest. In other words, if they [say] something 
about  me,  Joe  Bloggs  can’t  complain.  I  can  complain.  It  has  to  be  relative  to  me. 
That’s what they wanted to do and I was trying to get that system worked.”

6.19  Mr Toulmin gave the following reasons for the failure to exercise the discretion to investigate 

third-party complaints more regularly:144

“The position…is that the PCC pretty much takes all complaints but where there is a 
first party, their engagement is required. The saga of – very much in the early days 
of the PCC, where Lord McGregor made statements about Princess Diana and so on 
based on an understanding – a sort of outrage about how she was being treated, was 
very much seared on the consciousness of the Commission for years to come, which is 
that it is impossible to really take a view about the merits under the code of particular 
articles unless you have the involvement of the person concerned.”

6.20  The Inquiry received evidence from a number of witnesses about the impact of this policy; it 
renders it impossible for individuals or representative groups to bring complaints on behalf 
of sections of the community who were the subject of misleading or discriminatory articles. 
Representatives of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain made the point in the following 
way:145

“The  result  [of  the  PCC’s  refusal  to  accept  third  party  complaints]  is  that  as  long 
as they are carefully worded, derogatory references to Travellers can be published 
repeatedly,  as  they  were  in  the  Sun’s  ‘Stamp  on  the  camps’  campaign,  without 
committing any offence. Yet it is clear that articles of that sort do cause substantial 
damage to the rights and reputations of Travellers, fanning hostility against them in 
settled communities.”

6.21 

I now turn briefly to the refinement raised in evidence by Lord Hunt to which I referred at 
paragraph 6.12 above. Lord Hunt said that the practice of the PCC has been to entertain third 
party complaints “on accuracy on a point of fact”.146 However, exactly how this practice has 
been conducted remains unclear. Many issues of ‘fact’ may, on analysis, be issues of opinion.

Monitoring and investigations

6.22  The  PCC  did  not  monitor  for  breaches  of  the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice,  nor  did  it  launch 
investigations into potential breaches of the Code of its own volition. In response to comments 
made in the Report in 2010 by the CMS Select Committee into Press Standards, Privacy and 
Libel, Stephen Abell wrote that:147

“The Commission does not accept that it is possible – or appropriate – to monitor widely 
for compliance with the Code, especially given the vast amount of information that is 
now being published on and offline across the newspaper and magazine industry. At 
the heart of the Code is the protection of the individual and the Commission believes

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJa model of efficient and transparent complaints handling to be more appropriate to 
a digital age.”

6.23 

In a speech made in May 2003, Sir Christopher Meyer, expressed the view that:148

“any measure that would turn the PCC into a directive body – initiating complaints at 
random, intervening in issues which are nothing to do with the Code, or establishing 
any superior service for the rich and famous. We have a set of rules that work well for 
everyone – regardless of status – and we move away from them at our peril”.

6.24 

It  is  not  clear  what  link  is  supposed  to  exist  between  the  initiation  of  complaints  and  a 
differential service being offered to different categories of complainant. It is true that an issue 
under the Code would always have to arise, but that is so obvious that it goes without saying; 
the PCC could not act if no question of breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice had arisen.

6.25  The reference to moving away from rules ‘at our peril’ serves to elide two different concerns: 
the  first,  that  the  PCC  might  apply  rules  which  were  not  rooted  in  the  Code  (a  justifiable 
concern); the second that the PCC might take upon itself the function of investigating clear 
breaches of the Code in the absence of a direct complaint (an unjustifiable one). Neither do 
I understand the reference to the rich and famous. They are, presumably, more likely to be 
aware of the existence of the PCC, their rights and the ability to complain: the willingness to 
look at a wider picture is more likely to help those who are not in that position.

6.26  There are clearly circumstances when it would have been appropriate for the PCC to launch 
an investigation of its own motion, deploying the powers at its disposal under Article 53.1A. 
One clear case is in relation to newspaper coverage following the disappearance of Madeleine 
McCann. A fuller exploration of the conduct of the press in that case appears in Part F Chapter 
5 above, but for present purposes the focus is on the PCC alone. It is easy to see why the 
McCanns might not have wished to launch complaints on their own account, given the scale 
and  tone  of  media  interest  in  them,  and  the  nature  of  Sir  Christopher  Meyer’s  advice  to 
Dr Gerry McCann. It is, in my judgment, inexplicable that the PCC chose not to exercise its 
discretion to investigate in such a case.

6.27 

I note in this regard that a number of individuals gave evidence that they did not complain 
to the PCC because they were concerned that doing so would lead to retaliation from the 
newspaper industry in the shape of negative coverage or future invasions of privacy. Had the 
PCC initiated investigations of its own motion, or accepted third party complaints, the issue 
of retaliation would have been deadened. The PCC’s policy served to perpetuate a wholly 
unsatisfactory  state  of  affairs  whereby  complaints  were  (and  remain)  dis-incentivised  and 
the  PCC’s  own  contribution  to  the  evolving  principles  surrounding  the  issue  of  privacy  in 
particular  is  limited.  Lord  Wakeham’s  view  was  that  “The  PCC’s  absence  from  the  debate 
about privacy – including high profile adjudications – has … eroded its authority”.149 This view 
was valid in the late 1990s and remains so now.

Powers the PCC did not exercise – investigations where there 
were criminal or civil proceedings

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J“A complaint may be made by an individual or a body of persons ... but, in addition 
to  the  requirements  of  Article  53.1,  shall  only  be  entertained  or  its  consideration 
proceeded with if it appears to the Commission that:
...
the matter complained of is not the subject of proceedings in a court of law or tribunal 
in the United Kingdom; and
where the matter complained of is a matter in respect of which the person affected 
has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law in the United Kingdom, in the 
particular circumstances it is appropriate for the Commission to consider a complaint 
about it.”

6.29  There are a number of issues with these provisions which need to be explored. First, they 
incorrectly draw no distinction between criminal and civil proceedings. In the event that the 
PCC might become aware that a criminal investigation or proceeding has commenced, it is 
obviously  right  that  the  PCC  should  defer  any  investigation  it  might  undertake  of  its  own 
motion until such proceedings have been concluded. This is the practice of comparable bodies 
responsible for the regulation of a profession, such as the General Medical Council. Although 
in cases involving professionals it is standard practice to suspend individuals from practice 
pending the outcome of the criminal process, I fully recognise that different considerations 
rightly apply in relation to the press. The deferral of regulatory investigation may be regarded 
as a self-denying ordinance designed to meet the wider interests of justice and the possibility 
of creating prejudice.

6.30  The position is different in relation to civil proceedings. There may be reasons, depending 
on  the  facts  of  the  particular  case,  for  awaiting  the  outcome  of  such  proceedings  before 
commencing  any  regulatory  process,  but  there  is  no  requirement  to  elevate  this  into  an 
absolute prohibition; Article 53.3(b) is currently framed in those terms.

6.31  Second, and regardless of whether the proceedings in issue are criminal or civil, the provision 
has been interpreted by the PCC in such a way that as soon as any proceedings begin the 
ability of the PCC to entertain a complaint is precluded.150 But this is not how the provision 
is framed, as is apparent from the use of the present tense in Article 53.3(b). Neither is it 
the manner in which most regulators operate: extant proceedings may be a current bar to 
regulatory  action  (ie,  for  so  long  as  the  proceedings  may  continue),  but  not  an  indefinite 
prohibition.

6.32  Third, Article 53.3(c) is potentially of extremely wide application since most breaches of the 
Code could also give rise to civil action; this provision as drafted therefore suggests that in 
these circumstances (ie, the paradigm case of Code breach) the entertaining of a complaint by 
the PCC requires particular justification. Since there is no policy setting out how the PCC will 
exercise the discretion established by this Article, it is not clear whether the PCC interpreted 
this provision in so restrictive a manner. What is clear is that these Articles taken together 
were the purported basis for Sir Christopher Meyer’s advice to Dr McCann that the latter 
should  take  legal  action  in  relation  to  highly  defamatory  and  offensive  articles  above  the 

150 p22, lines 3-11, Tim Toulmin, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-

investigating complaints whilst civil proceedings are ongoing: see section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 1999, as 
amended by section 132(2) of the Communications Act 2003. The position is the same as regards the FSA 

1550

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ6.33 

disappearance of his daughter Madeleine, but that such a course of action would prohibit Dr 
McCann from seeking redress through the PCC.151

In  one  area  at  least,  the  PCC  appears  to  have  been  eager  to  take  on  cases  which  might 
otherwise have resulted in civil actions. Exercising this discretion, the PCC sought to gather in 
as many cases relating to privacy as possible, thereby restricting the number of privacy actions 
which went before the courts, despite (or perhaps because of) the option for complainants 
to bring a civil action for breach of privacy at least since the passage of the Human Rights 
Act.152 In my view these provisions have a stifling effect on the operation of the PCC, and are 
exceptionable. There was a lack of consistency and transparency in the exercise of the PCC’s 
discretion under Article 53.3(c) that militated against the proper function of the organisation 
as a proper regulator. More so the use of this discretion, particularly with regard to privacy, 
helped facilitate the PCC’s function as a shield for newspapers against litigation.153

Powers the PCC did not exercise – failure to hold oral hearings

6.34  The PCC has not held oral hearings in any cases. This means that it has not had the opportunity 
to ask questions or assess the credibility of parties where facts were contested. This was a 
deliberate practice and not the consequence of the lack of any relevant powers. The PCC 
had power to hold oral hearings under the existing Articles of Association, and PressBoF had 
argued this point in response to recommendations made by the CMS Select Committee.154 
The 2010 Independent Governance Review had also recommended that the PCC move to a 
policy of holding such hearings.155

6.35  The  PCC  has  justified  this  reluctance  to  use  these  powers  on  the  basis  that  that  it  might 
compromise its commitment to being free and fair. It has argued that oral hearings would 
lead to the involvement of lawyers, and that that would introduce a layer of expense and 
delay.156 But this is to overstate the position. First, this line of argument rather conveniently 
ignores  the  fact  that  the  industry  often  engaged  lawyers  when  responding  to  complaints 
made  through  the  PCC;  this  is  a  feature  that  I  explore  in  more  detail  below.  Second,  oral 
hearings would not be regarded as the general rule, but would only meet the end of justice in 
a case of particular complexity or where a dispute of fact arises on the material placed before 
the PCC. In any event, the PCC would not be looking at a system which encouraged mini-trials 
and concomitant expense and delay, but something far more streamlined and practical.

6.36  The holding of hearings where appropriate might have allowed the PCC better to demonstrate 
publicly  that  it  had  the  capacity  to  find  facts  and  to  question  any  inconsistencies  which 
emerged from the parties’ accounts of events. It may also have helped mitigate the small but 
unfortunate and, in my view, unnecessary number of cases in which no resolution or finding 
of fact could be made.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness JInequality of arms

6.37  The  PCC  has  argued  that  one  of  the  fundamental  advantages  of  the  existing  system  of 
self-regulation is that there is no need for complainants to go to the expense of engaging 
solicitors, as complaints officers employed by the PCC will oversee the process on behalf of 
the complainant. I note that in some cases complainants have chosen to do so irrespective of 
the cost. However, this line of argument serves to disguise a fundamental mismatch in terms 
of both resource and expertise, as the response of individual newspapers to complainants 
is  mostly  undertaken  by  the  legal  department  or  managing  editors  of  the  newspaper  in 
question.157  Thus,  while  respondent  publications  have  the  benefit  of  legal  assistance, 
complainants rely in the main on the PCC complaints officers to act as their advocate in the 
process.

6.38  There are two fundamental issues at play in this regard. The first relates to the training and 
experience of complaints officers at the PCC. The second relates to their role in the complaints 
process. Whilst I am satisfied that the complaint officers at the PCC were highly professional 
group of people who were skilled at what they did and did their best in trying circumstances, 
I do not accept that there existed in any way parity of arms between them and the lawyers 
and managing editors who responded on behalf of the industry. Complaints officers at the 
PCC  are  typically  recruited  straight  from  university  or  soon  after  graduating.  There  is  no 
requirement that they have any particular experience.158 As at September 2011, only two of 
the complaints officers had legal training; the others joined from other industries.159

6.39  The past two Directors of the PCC (excluding the present transitional director, from whom 
the Inquiry has not heard) were also recruited from within the ranks of complaints officers. 
Neither of them had had any substantial experience outside the PCC secretariat, and both 
were elevated to the position of Director at a relatively young age.160 I have already expressed 
my positive view of the abilities and qualities of Mr Toulmin and Mr Abell. However, the role 
of Director (effectively Chief Executive) of the PCC necessarily involved dealing with highly 
experienced figures within the newspaper industry, politics and other areas. There is at least 
a question mark over whether they had the overall fire-power to handle the leaders of the 
industry within the PCC’s purview. I doubt that the relationship was seen as being equal.

6.40  My second point relates to the function of the PCC complaints officers in this context. As set 
out above, users of the services of the PCC often spoke of the politeness and helpfulness of 
these complaints officers, as well as their ability to conjure up imaginative solutions. However, 
it would be fundamentally incorrect to suggest that the PCC represented the complainant 
in the process, and in so doing helped to bridge the even greater chasm in expertise and 
experience that existed between the vast majority of those who made complaints and the

complainant  and  the  industry,  passing  on  the  accounts  of  events  but  more  damagingly, 
particularly for the victims of press mistreatment, being unable to challenge in any way the 
version of events advanced by the industry even in those cases when these were clearly open 
to question.

Lack of powers – sanctions

6.41  The PCC does not have sufficient sanctions to act as a deterrent against breaches of the Code. 
PCC sanctions are limited to admonishment161 and the publication of adjudications. While it 
may be embarrassing for editors to publish adjudications, this sanction is not enough to deter 
repeat offending. Further, I have seen no evidence that the sanctions regime overall has had a 
long-term impact on the behaviour and actions of publications or journalists who were found 
to have transgressed.

6.42 

I am gratified that there is some support even among press figures for the conclusion that 
the sanctions available to the PCC’s battery are insufficient. For example, the Editor-in-Chief 
of Associated Newspapers, Paul Dacre, said at one of the Inquiry’s seminars in October 2011 
that, in his view, fines should be available in cases of the “most extreme malfeasance”.162 The 
editor of the Financial Times, Lionel Barber, gave evidence that an ability to impose fines is 
essential  for any replacement for the PCC.  However, Mr Barber also  emphasised  that the 
printing of prominent apologies or corrections were a real deterrent for editors.163

6.43  However,  PCC  witnesses  have  defended  the  current  range  of  sanctions  as  adequate.  Sir 

Christopher Meyer, for example, gave evidence that:164

“I had spent some time studying the PCC before taking this job….and what had become 
clear to me was that editors just did not like having to admit in their own newspapers 
that they had screwed up, in terms over which they had no control. That is to say 
the  text  of  the  adjudication,  as  agreed  by  the  Commission,  had  to  be  reproduced 
verbatim, under a PCC rubric in the newspaper…
So it wasn’t as if the statement ‘no editor wants the blemish of a negative adjudication 
on his or her record’ was some rash thing that I pulled from the sky. It was based on 
my experience, from what I’d read, from the experience of others in the PCC, Lord 
Black, who had been director for some time, and I have to say to you…after six years, 
it was an impression, again, that was strongly reinforced from my own experience”.

6.44  The PCC has argued that that fines are unnecessary, disproportionate and liable to create an 
overly legalistic disciplinary process. This line of argument has been advanced by a number 
of witnesses from the PCC. Sir Christopher set out the fundamentals of this argument in a 
speech in 2003:165

adjudications with due prominence: see the evidence of Tim Toulmin; p27, lines 11-18, Tim Toulmin, http://www.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J“... would invite the colonisation of the system by lawyers, with all the costs and delay 
that this would entail. You could throw ‘free’ and ‘fast’ out of the window. Those who 
believe that  fines  mean  sharper teeth  fail  to  understand  that  no  editor  wants  the 
blemish of a negative adjudication on his or her record.”

6.45  However,  the  points  raised  by  Sir  Christopher  misunderstand  the  difference  between 
providing redress (which must be free and fast) and the maintenance of standards which can 
be entirely free standing of the mechanism for complaints. Neither do I accept that it would 
necessarily lead to “the colonisation of the system by lawyers”: it would depend on the way 
in which the ‘system’ was set up and operated.

6.46  Lord Wakeham also gave evidence that explains the thinking underpinning the PCC’s historical 
opposition to fines. First, it would have been inappropriate for editors to be involved in the 
fining of other editors. Second, fines would have affected publications differentially. Third, in 
extreme cases newspapers might be put out of business by fines.166 In my view none of these 
arguments has any foundation. Clearly, editors should not be involved in decisions leading to 
the fining of other editors, but this is an argument for removing editors from the decision-
making process rather than for failing to empower the Commission where necessary. The 
economic arguments against fines clearly could be met by requiring the regulator to take 
ability  to  pay  into  account  (as  is  standard  in  any  regime  which  supports  the  imposition 
of financial penalties). In any event, fines would be reserved for only the most serious or 
systemic breaches of the Code.

6.47  The  PCC’s  opposition  to  a  system  of  fines  is  longstanding.  Writing  in  Risk  and  Regulation 
magazine in Autumn 2008, Tim Toulmin suggested that fines were unlikely to be effective, 
suggesting that they were a weaker sanction that an adverse adjudication:167

”[A] common misunderstanding is about the power of peer pressure: some people 
don’t rate it and think that only a system of fines would be an adequate deterrent 
or punishment. They couldn’t be more wrong. When the PCC sharpens its claws for a 
public criticism of an editor the howls of pain are loud and clear. No editor wants their 
decisions held up in public by their professional standards body as an example of bad 
practice. On the other hand, fines are a corporate rather than a personal punishment, 
and therefore not as keenly felt.”

6.48 

I am not impressed by this argument at all. Fines would be in addition to the publication of 
the companion adjudication. In the appropriate case, the editor could be required to pay 
an individual fine (whether or not his paper would defray the cost on his behalf would be 
another matter); and, in any event, a substantial fine imposed on a company would mark the 
seriousness of the breach and impact on the reputation of the editor.

6.49  Baroness Buscombe raised a different issue; she suggested that the introduction of fines might 
ruin the collaborative relationship between the self-regulatory structure and the industry and 
that this would have threatened the PCC’s ability to do its work:168

“…the whole issue of fines is quite fraught, one of the reasons being it has the risk 
of turning the system from one that is collaborative – which is really important on a 
Saturday night at 1 in the morning when you have the managing editor of the Sun or

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJthe Mail … discussing with the director whether or not something should be run … I 
have a hard time with lawyers I know understanding that actually a system where the 
collaborative can actually produce very good results as opposed to adversarial, and 
when you introduce a system of fines, there is a concern that that might break down 
the collaborative relationship.”

6.50  This evidence, however, betrays the fundamental flaw at the heart of the relationship between 
the PCC and the entities that it was supposed to be regulating, that uniquely it depends on 
an element of consent and collaboration between these parties. Although collusion would be 
too strong a term, the terms of engagement lack an appropriate deference; the concern to 
achieve collaboration should not be the order of the day, but rather the press should respect 
those who are regulating it. One only needs to compare the position of the Bar Standards 
Board,  the  Solicitors’  Regulation  Authority  and  the  General  Medical  Council  to  begin  to 
understand the fundamental difference between the colour and dynamics of a relationship 
between a regulator properly so called and the entities or parties being regulated.

6.51  The point I make here is a cultural one, and does not ignore the fact that the bodies I have 
identified are regulators of professional people rather than of an industry like the press: I 
am doing no more than pointing out the nature of the relationship between regulator and 
regulated. Furthermore, none of what I am saying in this context is intended to suggest that 
a regulated entity should not be assisting the regulator – in that specific sense, collaborating 
with it – if and when a complaint is made or the need for an investigation arises.

6.52  There is one further piece of evidence which lays bare the nature of the relationship between 
the PCC on the one hand and editors in particular in this regard. Until the amendment of 
the Editors’ Code of Practice in January 2011, the only obligation on editors in relation to 
the publication of adverse adjudications was that they should be given ‘due prominence’. 
Ultimately, this was a matter of judgment for the editor in question, rather than a matter for 
the PCC to impose. Sir Christopher Meyer was asked why he did not advocate amendments 
to the Code which would have enabled the PCC to insist on the placement of any adjudication 
in the newspaper, as it were whether the editor liked it or not. It was put to him that any 
regulator worthy of the name would have armed itself with such a power; Sir Christopher’s 
answer was that he had other more pressing priorities.169 Even now, the Code states that 
“prominence should be agreed with the PCC in advance”,170 a provision which sets out the 
expectation of a negotiation rather than any imposed outcome.

6.53  Overall, it is clear that the armoury of the PCC is limited and needs enhancement. I recognise 
that the industry has recently come to accept the force of this: the proposal put forward on 
behalf of the industry by Lord Black confers the power on the new body to levy fines in cases 
of serious or systemic breaches. Further, I should not be interpreted as suggesting that fines 
are appropriate in every case. In Part K Chapter 7 below I identify the circumstances in which 
the ability to impose a fine should exist. I should also make clear that my concern is not with 
the notion of an adverse adjudication; the Inquiry has heard examples of other regulatory 
systems in which the publication of an adverse adjudication is a real and effective sanction, 
but with the particular operation of this system through the PCC.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness JThe sanctions did not bite

6.54  There is no evidence that even the most severe sanctions available to the PCC had a real 
impact  on  those  who  transgressed.  Although  much  emphasis  was  placed  on  the  editors’ 
fear of an adverse adjudication, the impact of such an adjudication did not go beyond this; 
newspapers did not lose circulation as a consequence of criticism by the PCC nor is there 
much evidence that editors or journalists were disciplined in any significant manner171 or that 
their careers were in any way affected by PCC criticism.

6.55 

In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Wakeham set out the steps he made to improve public 
trust in the work of the PCC: including improvements to the sanctions available to the PCC 
and particularly the inclusion into journalists’ contracts of the Editors’ Code of Practice: “so 
that in the cases of serious Code breaches, I could refer the matter to the employer”.172 Lord 
Wakeham also cited the example of the public admonishment of Piers Morgan by Rupert 
Murdoch in 1995 following a strong PCC adjudication relating to the publication of pictures 
of Countess Spencer in the grounds of a private clinic as evidence of the effectiveness of the 
new sanctions.173

6.56  This  same  episode  was  dealt  with  in  evidence  by  Piers  Morgan  himself.  However,  the  gist 
of his evidence was somewhat different. Mr Morgan recalled a later conversation with Mr 
Murdoch in which the latter apologised for having publicly rebuked him. In Mr Morgan’s book 
The Insider, it is recorded that Mr Murdoch said “I’m sorry about all that press complaining 
thingamajig”.174 Mr Morgan has suggested that the rebuke was intended to mitigate pressure 
for a privacy law.175 In evidence, Mr Morgan told the Inquiry that it was his impression in light 
of this conversation that Mr Murdoch “did not give a toss” about the PCC.176 Mr Murdoch, in 
his evidence, has said that he did not recall speaking in this way, but that he might have said 
that the matter should be remembered but moved on from.177

6.57  A  similar  pattern  of  events  followed  the  public  criticism  of  the  former  editor  of  the  Daily 
Express, Peter Hill. Sir Christopher Meyer criticised Mr Hill for his newspaper’s coverage of the 
story of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, coverage for which the Express eventually 
apologised  publicly  and  paid  substantial  damages  to  the  McCann  family  for  defamation. 
However, when, somewhat late in the day, Sir Christopher excoriated Mr Hill and the Express’s 
coverage on the Radio 4 Today programme, the response of Northern & Shell’s proprietor 
Richard Desmond was not to criticise Mr Hill but rather to commiserate with him:178

“I remember that night after he was attacked by the chairman of the PCC, I remember 
calling him at 11 o’clock at night. I think he was convinced I was going to fire him. But 
I didn’t fire him, I spoke to him from 11 o’clock for about two hours and my ex-wife 

171 The available evidence is covered in Part C, Chapter 3 above

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJspoke to him for about an hour afterwards, you know, because he’d done to the best 
ability – report the facts.”

6.58 

In these two instances, criticism of an editor by the PCC – whether by formal adjudication 
or very public criticism by its Chair – does not seem to have had any negative effect on the 
careers of the editors concerned. Mr Morgan went on to continue a very high-profile career 
in journalism; Mr Hill is still employed by Northern & Shell as Editor Emeritus, although he did 
resign from the PCC shortly after the events in question. There is nothing to indicate in either 
case that the involvement of the PCC had the impact which is claimed for it.

6.59  The Inquiry has heard similar evidence from other quarters. For example, a former journalist 
with the People, was recorded by the film maker Chris Atkins discussing the PCC. It is clear 
from the conversation that the journalist was not overly concerned about the consequences 
of getting an adverse PCC decision:179

“…getting a PCC isn’t great, but a lot of papers just kind of brush it aside – all it is 
a little apology, somewhere in the paper – you get a slap on the wrists if you get 
reported by the PCC, but there’s no money.”

6.60  The Inquiry has heard evidence from a number of editors and representatives of the PCC 
itself that journalists now routinely have a requirement to comply with the Editors’ Code of 
Practice as a condition of their contracts. It was suggested that this meant that criticism by 
the PCC had real weight because it might lead to disciplinary action. However, the Inquiry has 
heard of only one instance of this ever happening. This evidence was provided by Stephen 
Abell. He recalled the dismissal of the journalists working on the Daily Mirror’s ‘City Slickers’ 
column for breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice. Mr Abell gave the following account of 
events:180

“In  an  internal  inquiry,  the  company  concluded  that  the  journalists  involved  had 
breached the Editors’ Code; as their contracts of employment had Code compliance 
written into them, the journalists were dismissed.”

6.61  Doubtless the ‘City Slickers’ journalists were in serious breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice. 
However,  given  that  their  activities  eventually  led  to  their  being  convicted  for  criminal 
offences, it is impossible to believe that they would not have been dismissed in any case. 
I also record that the dismissal came following an internal investigation rather than a PCC 
investigation. It is therefore difficult to draw the inference that the inclusion of provisions 
requiring adherence to the Editors’ Code in journalists’ contracts of employment has in itself 
resulted in improved behaviour or, as asserted by Lord Wakeham, effectively given the PCC 
an additional, effective, sanction.

6.62  The picture that emerges from this evidence is that while editors and others may have been 
personally embarrassed by criticisms by the PCC, the sting was the result of the personal 
dislike of being criticised rather than the sanction.181 In this respect I am in agreement with the 
ethicist, Dr Neil C. Manson of the University of Lancaster. In his written evidence he described

1557

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jthe sanctions for breach of the PCC Code as “woefully inadequate.”182 In my judgment, that 
is a correct assessment. Whatever their limited merits, they did not provide a sufficiently 
powerful deterrent to prevent journalists and editors from breaching the Editors’ Code of 
Conduct.

Too many negotiated settlements

6.63  Many  witnesses  and  commentators  have  criticised  the  PCC  for  mediating  too  many 
complaints to a negotiated conclusion rather than giving formal adjudications.183 A number 
of reasons have been advanced for this: newspapers know how to string out the process, 
causing “complaint fatigue”; newspapers prefer to come to some sort of private accord with 
complainants to  avoid  the likelihood  of  an  adverse adjudication;  and  the whole  system is 
geared towards PCC complaints officers acting as mediators and conduits to the compromise 
of disputes.

6.64  A cursory examination of the statistics shows that few complaints reach the stage of formal 
adjudication, and that – although the figures vary from year to year – about half of these 
are resolved in favour of the complainant.184 This very last statistic does not give cause for 
concern in itself, but given the number of complaints in any one year what is troubling is the 
paucity of cases which eventually arrive at the adjudication stage. The PCC would claim that 
this is a mark of the success rather than the weakness of the system. That is because many 
complainants welcome a relatively speedy resolution, and in a different context it might be 
remarked  that  well  over  95%  of  all  civil  disputes  are  resolved  consensually,  although  as  I 
note elsewhere,185 resolution through mediation is not always speedy. However, given that a 
mediated complaint does not feature in any statistics as a breach of the Code, is seems clear 
that from the point of view of public accountability and compliance there is a misleading 
picture.

6.65  Further, this different context does need to be understood. The policy reasons militating in 
favour of the compromise of private disputes (cost; avoidance of court time; the preference 
for settlement over a fight to the bitter end) do not apply with anything like the same force 
in relation to matters which possess, or at least ought to possess, a regulatory or standards 
dimension. In most regulatory regimes, the complainant and the regulated party are given 
the opportunity to sort out the dispute between themselves,186 but once that process breaks 
down the regulator takes over and investigates the matter. There is a balance to be struck 
between mediation and formal adjudication, but I have little doubt but that under the current 
system that balance has fallen in the wrong place.

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJLack of transparency about statistics

6.66  The  PCC  has  not  been  transparent  about  its  own  performance  and  the  performance  of 
newspapers. Figures published purporting to demonstrate both were not easy to understand,187 
meaning that the public could not readily assess the performance of the PCC in particular or 
of the newspapers which came into contact with it. Throughout there is an imprecision as to 
the use of language which obscures meaning. The words ‘ruling’, ‘decision’, ‘adjudication’ and 
‘resolution’ are nowhere defined and appear to be used interchangeably. Mr Toulmin was 
taken at length through the statistics for 2007 (this year chosen at random to illustrate the 
point). From these, it was difficult to understand:

(a) 
(b) 

the basis for sifting out approximately 50% of complaints at the first stage;
the basis on which complaints were assessed as raising a prima facie issue under 
the Code at the second stage;

(c)  what was meant by the term ‘rulings’ in this second context given that so many 

complaints were thereafter mediated to a compromise; and
the exact basis on which certain complaints went forward to adjudication.188

(d) 

6.67  This lack of transparency is strikingly thrown into relief by a comparison between two separate 
pieces of data. In January 2011, just after the departure of the Northern & Shell titles from 
the system, the director of the PCC wrote an internal memorandum to the Commissioners 
informing them of the ramifications.189 This stated as follows:

“In 2009 the PCC received 719 complaints about Express titles...It made 140 rulings, 
including 52 occasions where there was a breach of the Code that required remedial 
action.
These are significant complaints figures (in comparison all News International titles 
produced 790 complaints, 292 rulings and 90 breaches of the Code. The complaints 
also  tend  to  focus  on  controversial  issues  such  as  immigration,  and  often  cluster 
around articles that cause particular and widespread comment...”

6.68  A number of points need to be made about this. First, a comparison between these unpublished 
data and the PCC’s published statistics190 shows a stark discrepancy: for example, whereas the 
former demonstrate that the PCC apparently upheld 142 breaches of the Code in relation to 
two publishers alone, the latter appear to show a much lower figure. Furthermore, the PCC 
appears to be in a position whereby complaints statistics can be given on a publisher specific 
basis. The clear inference is that more could be done to explain the position to the public.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J6.69  Overall, these statistics as presented in the Annual Reviews have tended to underplay the 
significance of mediation as the centre piece of the PCC’s work as well as to obscure the fact 
that many so called ‘prima facie’ breaches of the Code were, in fact, likely breaches. Further, 
the PCC have failed to publish aggregate figures for complaints made against newspapers, 
meaning that neither the public nor policy-makers could get any idea of which publications 
were most regularly in breach of the Editors’ Code of Conduct. In any event, any newspapers 
who adopted a strategy of settling complaints at a late stage (by which time the merits of 
the complaints would have been clear) in order to avoid adverse adjudications would not 
be accurately represented in any league table. Although it is not clear why this practice was 
adopted, what is clear is that it worked to the advantage of the industry, who could point 
to  near  unblemished  records  in  relation  to  breaches  of  the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice;  the 
evidence as revealed in Mr Abell’s memorandum to the Commission was, in fact, manifestly 
different.

Prominence of the organisation

6.70  A number of commentators have observed that the public profile of the PCC has been too low. 
However, I have heard little evidence on this matter and will restrict myself to few comments 
in this respect. The evidence shows that the PCC has had some difficulty in publicising itself 
and the work that it did. Certainly, the PCC made some efforts to raise its profile, first by 
asking publications to donate space both in print editions and online to publicising the work 
of the PCC; and also by engaging in profile raising events around the country.

6.71  Under the Chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, this was done through seeking out high profile 
complainants, thereby raising the profile of the organisation when it was reported that such 
a complainant had used the services of the PCC. In Lord Wakeham’s view the failure in recent 
years to attract high-profile complainants has been a real weakness of the system and has 
contributed to the loss of confidence among the public more generally:191

“…the respect of the PCC has gone down in recent years because they haven’t had 
the high-profile complaints they used to have, and the high-profile complainers say 
‘we would sooner take the matter to the courts’” therefore the PCC doesn’t deal with 
them, the PCC’s standing goes down…”

6.72  Other senior figures at the PCC also recognised that the lack of prominence in the public mind 
was a serious problem which hindered the organisation from doing its work. Mr Toulmin, said 
in evidence to the Inquiry that:192

“…one of the things that used to strike me, and upset me…was hearing from members 
of the public who had a perfectly reasonable complaint to make or we could have 
helped in some way stopping harassment or helping them with their difficulty and 
they’d never heard of the PCC … although it does have quite a high name recognition, 
it’s by no means universal, and the newspaper and magazine industry is in a very 
good position to refer prominently to the existence of this organisation, and whilst 
they did do some good work and they published numerous free adverts at obviously 
expense to themselves, their regular references to the PCC were much less impressive, 
I thought, than they could have been”.

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ6.73  However, it must be acknowledged that this is not a new issue. For example in August 2004, 
there was an exchange of letters between Sir Brian Cubbon, then Chair of the PCC Charter 
Compliance Panel, and Sir Christopher, concerning the very same question of prominence 
and publicity being given to the PCC.193

6.74 

In  this  respect,  I  understand  Mr  Toulmin’s  point;  it  is  well  made.  It  cannot  simply  be  the 
responsibility  of  the  PCC  or  the  self-regulatory  system  itself  to  raise  the  PCC’s  profile  by 
attracting well known complainants or otherwise publicising its work. In any event, seeking 
to  attract  well  known  complainants  might  be  thought  to  be  making  assumptions  about 
the validity of complaints that they might wish to make: to attract a complaint that is then 
dismissed would hardly encourage others. The press could and should have done more to 
assist with that project so that no potential complainant was left in ignorance of the existence 
of the PCC or of the services it could offer.

7.1 

Investigatory	failures
In this section of this Chapter I will examine the PCC’s response, or rather the lack of it, to 
Operation Motorman before moving to an assessment of the reports of 2007 and 2009 into 
phone hacking.

7.2 

7.3 

Operation Motorman
The narrative of the detailed discussions that took place between the PCC and the industry 
on the one hand and the Information Commissione’s Office (ICO), on the other is considered 
in various Parts and Chapters of this Report.194 and it is unnecessary to revisit the history. 
Although the involvement of the PCC has been covered, this has been largely through the 
lens of the Information Commissioner. I take this opportunity to review the matter briefly 
through the prism of the PCC.

Richard Thomas, the former Information Commissioner, approached the PCC in the belief 
that it was the industry regulator. He thus applied to the PCC for assistance in putting a stop 
to  the  use  by  the  press  of  private  investigators  using  illegal  techniques  to  obtain  private 
data. He was hoping, if not expecting, that the PCC might achieve this by way of a general 
condemnation of the practice, and securing appropriate changes to the Editors’ Code.195

7.4  Mr Thomas’ belief was a misapprehension that the PCC was a regulator; and, indeed, this was 
one of a number of concerns raised by Sir Christopher about the expectations and helpfulness 
of the Information Commissioner. Sir Christopher told the Inquiry that at their first meeting, 
in November 2003, Mr Thomas appeared to be labouring under the misapprehension that 
the PCC had the ability to enforce the criminal law,196 which of course it did not. Even a self-
regulator properly so called is not able to do that.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J7.5  Whilst Sir Christopher was very clear with Mr Thomas that the PCC could not ‘take over’ specific 
cases, and that enforcing the law was for statutory bodies, not the PCC,197 nonetheless the 
PCC and its representatives appeared keen to present themselves as the de facto regulator 
for the press and the relevant body for any such discussion. Indeed, it is perhaps telling of the 
PCC’s desire to be regarded as regulator that Sir Christopher made no effort to disabuse Mr 
Thomas of this misapprehension immediately.

7.6 

The PCC demonstrated a willingness to play a lead role in dealing with the issue from the 
press perspective. This was despite the fact that, as Mr Toulmin acknowledged, that:198

“he probably came to the wrong place anyway. I think he’s accepted that. He either 
should have gone directly to the industry, the trade bodies, or straight to the Code 
Committee, possibly, which is more representative of the industry.”

7.7 

7.8 

Throughout, the position of the PCC was not, perhaps, as straightforward as might be expected 
of an industry body presented with allegations of serious wrongdoing. Sir Christopher was 
evidently interested in what he heard about Operation Motorman; he characterised the ICO 
as describing a “fairly apocalyptic situation”.199 However, Sir Christopher also wanted firm 
evidence. He said:200

“I wanted beef. I wanted red meat, Mr Jay, and he didn’t give it to me.”

The initial meetings between Mr Thomas and Sir Christopher, in which Sir Christopher asked 
for more concrete evidence and Mr Thomas declined to provide it, led to a curious state of 
impasse. The lack of will underpinning this slow progress is suggested in remarks made by 
Sir Christopher Meyer in response to questions put by Mr Jay as to whether the PCC could 
not simply have taken on trust the ICO’s indication of the extent of the problem without the 
underlying data. Sir Christopher’s answer was that while, of course, it could be assumed Mr 
Thomas would not have made the allegations without some substance, they never saw the 
substance, or the expected litigation.

7.9 

The position of the PCC was relatively clear, and remained constant: before they would act, 
they wanted details of the underlying data, and decisive action from the ICO.201 Furthermore, 
the PCC refused to take any action while criminal proceedings were pending or possible. This 
added to the inertia.

7.10  How they would act should such data be forthcoming was not so clear. It is Sir Christopher’s 
contention that such evidence would have enabled the PCC to “have gone into some kind 
of action with the newspapers in question”, and to sharpen and hone their guidance to the 
press. Exactly, what such action would have involved is unclear, given the limited powers and 
room for manoeuvre open to the PCC. Certainly the request for concrete evidence sat oddly 
with the ICO’s request for forward looking guidance for the press on data protection issues. 
Indeed, given the context of the request, it is somewhat surprising that the PCC was not more 
forthcoming with suggestions of practical further steps.

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ7.11  Mr Toulmin said that he was very clearly of the view that the PCC was “a complaints body 
looking at breaches of the code of practice rather than the Data Protection Act”, and suggested 
that it may not even have been appropriate for the PCC to have issued any guidance on the 
Data Protection Act. However, if this view is correct, then it was and remains inappropriate for 
the PCC to have held itself out as a regulator and taken the lead in this dialogue. In evidence 
to the Inquiry Mr Toulmin said:202

“The  question  was,  I  think,  where  the  different  responsibilities  lay.  The  PCC,  as  a 
platform  for  discussing  the  behaviour  of  journalists  and  so  on  in  another  context, 
which was about the application of the code of practice, was happy also to say, ‘By 
the way, Richard Thomas has this campaign about the Data Protection Act and he’s 
right to do so’, but beyond that, it was difficult really to know what the PCC could do.”

7.12  Mr Toulmin  was undoubtedly right that, even if wrongdoing had been demonstrated, the 
PCC was largely powerless to act. However, it is far from clear that this message was ever 
communicated properly to the ICO, other than in Sir Christopher Meyer’s veiled suggestion 
that  the  ICO  do  more  in  this  area.  Rather,  the  dialogue  between  the  organisations  was 
conducted as if it were one of putative regulatory equals. Any acknowledgement that this 
was  not  the  case  came  only  much  later.  It  is  also  quite  clear  that  the  resulting  stalemate 
between the two regulatory bodies was to the distinct advantage of the industry: it averted 
any further criticism and prevented the scrutiny of what were, in some cases, clearly highly 
dubious practices.

7.13  The PCC did work with the ICO to develop and issue guidance on compliance on the DPA. 
It took over 16 months from the first meeting between Mr Thomas and Sir Christopher to 
produce and amounted to no more than three pages of guidance that bore no relation to the 
‘condemnation’ that Mr Thomas had been looking for.

7.14  The guidance note provides a very basic guide to the ideas contained in the Act.203 The bulk 
of  the  note,  however,  is  dedicated  to  explaining  the  exemption  for  journalistic  purposes, 
including the fact that in considering whether a data controller’s belief was reasonable that 
publication was or would be in the public interest, regard may be had by the court to his 
compliance with the PCC Code of Practice. It then proceeds to remind the reader of what the 
Code says on the public interest and how the PCC has interpreted it. The note does mention 
that there is a specific criminal offence of unlawful obtaining of personal data. Moreover no 
mention whatsoever is made of the Motorman prosecutions or of the allegations that the 
press had been substantial customers of those prosecuted.

7.15  Furthermore,  there  is  no  reference  to  the  risks  of  using  private  investigators  to  obtain 
personal information or the need to ensure that they do so in accordance with the law. On no 
level could it be suggested that this guidance note was part of a strategy either to condemn 
unlawful data use or to warn the industry of the risks that it might be running. On the contrary, 
if anything the guidance note tends towards reassuring the press that there are sufficient 
exemptions for journalistic activity to mean that they need not even think about the issues.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J7.16  There is no doubt that this was a deliberate approach on the part of the PCC, as Mr Toulmin 

explained:204

“Q.  Would you agree there was no attempt by the PCC in 2005, through its guidance, 
specifically to warn the press of what they should do in the future by reference to 
what they might have done in the past?
A.  I would agree with that. I think this guidance note was what we were asked to do 
by the Information Commissioner.
Q.  Did not the PCC form its own view as to what might be appropriate, given what 
the  Information  Commissioner  was  saying  about  the  scale  of  the  activity,  namely 
what warnings should be given?
A.  Well, this was regarded to be appropriate. There are arguments about whether it 
should even have done this, given that it was a complaints body looking at breaches 
of the code of practice rather than the Data Protection Act, but it did want to be 
helpful and this was the outcome.”

7.17  The inadequacy of this response vividly demonstrates two weaknesses in the PCC’s approach. 
First, despite the apparent protection of privacy afforded by clause 3 of the Code of Practice, 
the potential widespread use of illegal techniques to secure access to personal data does 
not seem to have struck the Commission as a potential breach of the Code. Secondly, this is 
a graphic illustration of the inability of the PCC to act as a regulator in any meaningful sense. 
These weaknesses in the reaction of the PCC might be explained by the fact that the PCC felt 
that on this issue they were unable to act without the consent of the industry.205

7.18  The efforts made by the PCC did not stop with the issuing of the guidance. Sir Christopher 

also made some speeches in which he touched on the issue.206

7.19  However,  it  is  not  particularly  surprising  that  Mr  Thomas  was  unhappy  that  the  PCC  had 
not done more. Eventually, on 13 July 2006, there was a meeting between the ICO and the 
PCC  at  which  Mr  Thomas  specifically  expressed  his  disappointment  that  the  PCC  had  not 
been more forthright in its condemnation of what appeared to good evidence of wholesale 
breaches of s55 of the Data Protection Act 1998.207 Sir Christopher denied that Mr Thomas’ 
disappointment  was  justified,  pointing  to  his  speeches,  interviews  and  the  PCC’s  Annual 
Reviews,208 but in my view it was: no formal steps had been taken by the PCC to take up this 
issue with the industry. Equally, Mr Thomas might well have been disappointed further when 
he was informed by Sir Christopher that the “PCC is not able to act as a general regulator”, 
the reason for this apparently being:209

“I  think  what  I  had  in  mind  there  was  a  notion  that  we  should  in  some  way  take 
on the work of the Information Commissioner by virtue of being a Press Complaints 
Commission, and this is what I wanted to reject. The point I always made to Mr Thomas, 
apart from my insistent demands on beef, was to suggest that we had to work in a

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJcomplementary way. He did his thing, but there were things that we could do to help 
him, and I’ve described them in the – before lunch. And I think as a consequence of 
this precise meeting, it led to direct contacts between the Code Committee and Mr 
Thomas, which led to a change in clause 10 on subterfuge in the code of practice.”

7.20  This introduces a further issue, which relates to the distinction between the PCC and the 
Editors’ Code of Practice Committee. This was a distinction which, without some words of 
explanation from Sir Christopher, appears to have been was completely (and understandably) 
lost on Mr Thomas. No such explanation was forthcoming when the matter was first discussed 
in November 2003; it was only given in July 2006. Sir Christopher was asked why he did not 
himself raise the issue directly with that Committee rather than leaving it to Mr Thomas to 
make direct contact. He replied:210

“...I thought actually this would be helpful. Rather than mediating his contacts with 
the Code Committee on the matter of clause 10, the very best thing he could do was 
to speak to them directly. It was a kind of obvious, common sense practical thing to 
do, to which he raised no objection, and which bore fruit.
Q.  But is this not another example of you adopting a somewhat minimalist approach, 
leaving it to Mr Thomas to have dealings with, in effect, your own Code of Practice 
Committee?
A.  If that is minimalism, that is a strange concept, considering the amount of effort we 
had made to exhort journalists to obey the Data Protection Act, without ever having 
been given evidence of which journalists and which newspapers had committed sins. 
So I think that – what was this, our third meeting with Mr Thomas, I believe? Yes, 
third. It might have been fourth but I think it was third. It was a thoroughly positive 
and constructive thing to do, which bore fruit.”

7.21 

It would have been helpful had Mr Thomas been appropriately advised of the position much 
earlier. Sir Christopher could and should have raised the matter with the Code Committee 
shortly after the first meeting in November 2003; alternatively a joint approach could have 
been organised.

7.22  Sir Christopher’s third concern was that the ICO failed to provide him with hard evidence 
(‘the beef’) of criminality by individual journalists and titles. This was a point which he had 
developed at some length before the Select Committee, and which was probed before the 
Inquiry in a series of questions:211

“Q.  The next question and final question on the ICO issue is one which others, I know, 
want me to put. You get the second report. You get the table in the second report. The 
Daily Mail happens to be top of the list but maybe it doesn’t matter precisely who it 
is. Why don’t you call in the editor, or one of the editors or some of the editors near 
the top of the list, and ask for an explanation?
A.  I was not in the business of calling in editors to explain actions that were perfectly 
legal. The beef had to be an indication of which newspapers and which journalists 
had  actually  hired  inquiry  agents  to  procure  information  illegally.  Then  we  would 
have been in a different ball game, but we never got there.
Q.  But that’s a misunderstanding, I think, Sir Christopher, of the table in the second 
report. The table in the second report evidenced, in Mr Thomas’ view, probably illegal 

210 p4, lines 1-20, ibid 
211 pp4-5, lines 21-24, ibid 

1565

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jtransactions. So the point I’m putting to you is: on the basis of that table alone and 
assuming that Mr Thomas it is acting in good faith and has evidence, as he must be 
doing, why not call in some editors and ask for an explanation?
A.  He can have all the good faith in the world, but like the chairman of the Select 
Committee himself, I wanted to see the beef. Then we had something to say to the 
editors. And it wasn’t just me; it was also the Select Committee itself wanted to know 
the answer. He couldn’t He couldn’t give it. So by definition, there was a limit to what 
could have been done.”

7.23  The ICO’s second report in particular had clearly explained the basis for the conclusion that the 
transactions tabulated in Table 6 were likely to be in breach of s55 of the Data Protection Act. 
The newspapers at the top of the table were plainly identified for all to see. Sir Christopher 
had enough ‘beef’ to take these matters up with the editors involved had he chosen to do 
so, but he did not. I regret that I have a very real concern that even had Mr Thomas supplied 
the extra slices of evidential beef which might have satisfied Sir Christopher (by some detail) 
little or nothing would have been done with it, perhaps because of the absence of first hand 
complaint. The PCC after all lacked the powers to operate as a ‘general regulator’, and Sir 
Christopher is unlikely to have knocked on the doors of the editors involved seeking their 
explanations.

7.24 

In my view, the critical fallout from the Operation Motorman episode is not confined to the 
ICO; it embraces the PCC, for the reasons I have explained. As a whole, the industry response 
to Operation Motorman, led by the PCC, replicated the pattern of disinterest, intransigence 
and inertia with which the industry has historically met criticism.

Phone hacking: what powers did the PCC have and what role 
should they have played?

7.25  Lord Wakeham testified that he did not view it as part of the role of the PCC to investigate 
criminal or potentially criminal allegations. He described the stance taken by the PCC under 
his chairmanship as follows:212

“[I] never considered it was my role to look into allegations of criminality or illegality. 
Quite apart from the practical implications of trying to run a quasi-police operation, 
we never had the powers to do so. When matters of a suspicious nature came up we 
therefore declined to deal with them and referred them to the relevant authorities to 
take them up.”

7.26  A similar point was made by Baroness Buscombe in her evidence to the Inquiry. She said that 
“we [the PCC] have neither the locus, or power to intervene. We were very clear that we could 
not duplicate the work of the CPS of the police”.213 She characterised the intervention of the 
PCC as an effort to try to meet public concern about phone hacking and journalistic ethics 
generally:214

“What is sometimes lost in this issue is that the PCC, in trying in 2009 to meet rising 
public concern about events at News International exceeded its remit. It is an open

1566

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJquestion as to whether the PCC would now be better placed if it has made publicly 
clear in 2009 that it was in no position sensibly to examine the charges made about 
News International”.

7.27  This has the appearance of amounting to a form of special pleading. The PCC had previously 
reassured Parliamentarians that the issue of hacking or listening into private conversations 
had been addressed. In a submission to the CMS Select Committee in 2003, the PCC wrote 
that:215

“One area of general concern in the early 1990s was the apparent reliance by some 
newspapers on material that appeared to have been obtained as a result of bugging or 
eavesdropping on telephone exchanges. Section B 2 [of the submission] outlines how 
the Code Committee reacted to this concern by introducing, in 1993, a rule forbidding 
such practices in the absence of a public interest. Since then only one breach of the 
Code has been brought to the Commission s attention – in 1996 – which clearly shows 
how the Code can change newspaper behaviour. Since the breach in 1996 there have 
been no others”.

7.28  There is no reason why in principle the PCC should not have investigated or sought to publish 
a report into allegations of phone hacking. There were no pitfalls so long as the PCC was clear 
and open about the extent of the powers it had, the extent of the investigations it was able 
to carry out, and the nature of the investigations it had carried out.

7.29  The  2007  and  2009  investigations,  leading  to  the  reports  respectively  entitled  “Report  on 
Subterfuge and Newsgathering” and “Report on Phone Message Tapping Allegations”, both 
suffered from similar flaws. Ignoring the issue as to its ability to obtain accurate answers, 
the PCC did not ask the right questions to discover the true extent of the practice of phone 
hacking, or whether it was more widespread than had previously emerged; neither did it pay 
sufficient attention to evidence which suggested that what was being asserted was not the full 
picture. In both reports, the PCC concluded that there was no evidence that phone hacking 
was widespread, when at best it should have expressed itself in far more non-committal (if 
not wholly non committal) terms. In the 2009 report, there was the additional feature of the 
belittling of those who were contending that hacking was widespread.

2007 investigation

7.30  The PCC made a press statement on phone hacking in August 2006. In that statement the 
PCC made it clear that, in line with Article 53(3)(c) of its Articles of Association, it would not 
investigate or comment on the issue of phone hacking before the conclusion of the police 
investigation into Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman. It did however reserve the right to 
launch an investigation following the conclusion of that investigation.216 The PCC also referred 
to its own 2003 decision in the case of Foster v The Sun, in which The Sun admitted that it had 
printed transcripts of tapped phone conversations between the businessman Peter Foster 
and his mother at the height of controversy relating to Cherie Blair’s purchase of property in 
Bristol.217

1567

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J7.31  On  1  February  2007  the  PCC  announced  the  action  that  it  would  be  taking  following  the 
conviction of Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire.218 Sir Christopher Meyer announced that the 
PCC would be taking steps to ensure that the public could be satisfied “that lessons have been 
learned from this episode, both at the newspaper and more generally”.219 The PCC committed 
to explore three things:

“First,  we  are  writing  to  the  new  editor  of  the  News  of  the  World  with  a  number 
of questions, including what he will be doing to ensure that the situation involving 
Mr  Goodman  and  Mr  Mulcaire  does  not  recur.  Second,  we  will  be  writing  to  the 
editors of national and regional newspapers and magazines to find out the extent 
of  internal  controls  aimed  at  preventing  intrusive  fishing  expeditions;  and  what  is 
being done to instil understanding both of the Code of Practice and the law in this 
area, and also of journalistic public interest exemptions. The Data Protection Act has 
an obvious relevance here. Third, the board of the Commission will consider these 
industry responses with a view to publishing a review of the current situation, with 
recommendations for best practice if necessary, in order to prevent a similar situation 
arising in the future. This is in line with its duty to promote high professional standards 
of journalism.”

7.32  The 2007 investigation was primarily forward looking. The PCC did not set out to discover 
whether the type of illegal activity which Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire had engaged in was 
more widespread than the activity of a single rogue reporter in a single newspaper.

7.33  The PCC chose not to engage in a more wide-ranging investigation despite the sentencing 
remarks of Mr Justice Gross which referred to contact between Mr Mulcaire and “others” at 
the News of the World;220 and the allegation from the Daily Mail that Mr Mulcaire was being 
paid £200,000 per annum by the NoTW.221

7.34  As a first step in the investigation, Mr Tim Toulmin wrote to Mr Myler on 7 February 2007.222 
He asked Mr Myler a series of questions arising from the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr 
Mulcaire. There was a particular focus on whether or not the employment of a third party, 
i.e. Mr Mulcaire, had been an attempt to circumvent the provisions of the Editors’ Code of 
Conduct. The questioning also focussed on whether internal procedures had been tightened 
up since the detection of Mr Goodman’s activities, to prevent any repeat. In line with the 
general approach of this investigation, Mr Toulmin’s letter did not seek to explore whether 
the practice of phone hacking or any other invasions of privacy was more widespread within 
the NoTW than had previously emerged.

7.35  While the PCC questions were not directed to the question of whether phone hacking was 
more  widespread  than  had  previously  emerged,  Mr  Myler  took  pains  to  emphasise  that 
phone hacking was an activity engaged in only by Mr Goodman:223

“Although, as I said earlier, there can be no question of complacency, this was an 
exceptional  and  unhappy  event  in  the  163  years  of  history  of  News  of  the  World, 
involving one journalist.”

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ7.36  He also informed the PCC that “I do believe that Mr Mulcaire was operating in a confined 
environment run by Clive Goodman”’224 Mr Myler’s assertion to the PCC was that Mr Muclaire 
had been engaged by the NoTW to carry out legitimate searches and investigations, and then 
retained separately by Mr Goodman to carry out illegal phone hacking.225 Mr Myler further 
asserted that the illegal aspect of Mr Mulcaire’s activities had been completely unknown to 
anyone at the NoTW other than Mr Goodman.226

7.37  The PCC did not interview the former editor of the NoTW, Andy Coulson, in its preparation 
for the 2007 report or indeed ask him to provide written evidence to the investigation. It is 
surprising that the PCC was content to direct its questions at Mr Myler, a man who had only 
taken over as editor of the NoTW a matter of weeks before answering the PCC’s questions; 
had never worked there before, and until he took over as editor of the NoTW had been living 
and working in New York. In the 2007 report, the reason given for the failure to interview or 
otherwise question Mr Coulson was that he had resigned from the editorship of the NoTW 
and therefore no longer came under the PCC’s jurisdiction:227

“Given that the PCC does not – and should not – have statutory powers of investigation 
and prosecution, there could be no question of trying to duplicate the lengthy police 
investigation.  Furthermore,  Mr  Coulson  was,  following  his  resignation,  no  longer 
answerable to the PCC, whose jurisdiction covers journalists working for publications 
that subscribe to the self-regulatory system through the Press Standards Board of 
Finance.”

7.38  The first of these points may go to the question of what the PCC should investigate, and how it 
should do so. It has no bearing on whether or not Mr Coulson should have been interviewed 
or otherwise questioned. The second point, that Mr Coulson was no longer employed by a 
publication subscribing to PressBoF, has no merit either. There was nothing to prevent the 
PCC from asking Mr Coulson to answer questions, even after he had left the employment of 
a newspaper. The PCC had previously asked questions of journalists after their dismissal, for 
example in the City Slickers investigation where the PCC approached both journalists, James 
Hipwell and Anil Bhoyrul for information after they had been dismissed by the Daily Mirror.228 
Sir Brian Cubbon, the PCC’s Charter Commissioner, recommended Mr Toulmin in an email on 
1 May 2007 that Mr Coulson should be interviewed.229 If Mr Coulson had declined to answer 
questions the PCC might have drawn inferences from that refusal.

7.39 

In  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  Sir  Christopher  said  that  “it  might  have  been  presentationally 
better”230 if Mr Coulson had been interviewed in the course of the 2007 investigation, but 
did  not  say  that  he  believed  that  the  2007  report  would  have  been  better  in  substance. 
It is surprising that Sir Christopher did  not believe that it would  have been better from a 
substantive perspective had the PCC interviewed Mr Coulson. Any investigator determined to 
arrive at the truth would have wished to interview the editor of the newspaper at which the 
alleged wrongdoing took place.

7.40  The process of the investigation revealed the extent to which the PCC’s capacity to operate as 
a standards regulator was constrained by industry control. An email from Eve Salomon, one

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jof the lay commissioners at the time, to Mr Toulmin on 2 May 2007, questioned the proposal 
that the PCC should work to raise standards in respect of data protection within the press:231

“I remain wary, as calling newspapers generally to account like that strikes me as 
entering into another level of regulation. Fine if the industry wants it, but we don’t 
want  to  alienate  everybody!  If  we  do  say  something,  my  suggestion  would  be 
something  like  we  will  be  contacting  the  industry  again  in  6  months  to  ask  what 
changes they have made in the light of our report.”

7.41  Despite the questioning of NoTW representatives being limited to prospective changes, and 
the failure to draw upon material which might have indicated otherwise, at least inferentially, 
the 2007 report purported to come to conclusions about the prevalence of phone hacking 
within the industry:232

“No evidence has emerged either from the legal proceedings or the Commission’s 
Questions to Mr Myler and Mr Hinton of a conspiracy at the newspaper going beyond 
Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire to subvert the law and the PCC’s Code of Practice. 
There is no evidence to challenge Mr Myler’s assertion that: Goodman had deceived 
his  employer  in  order  to  obtain  cash  to  pay  Mulcaire;  that  he  had  concealed  the 
identity of the source of information on royal stories; and that no-one else at the 
News of the World knew that Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire were tapping phone 
messages for stories.”

7.42  Later in the 2007 report, the PCC once again appeared to accept the position that phone hacking 
was limited to those who had already been prosecuted, saying that “[t]he Commission’s role 
here has been additional to the law, which has already investigated, prosecuted and punished 
the  people  responsible  for  the  phone  message  tapping.”233  The  PCC  did  not  ask  questions 
designed to find out whether or not phone hacking had been more widespread than originally 
supposed. Instead, the 2007 report appeared to exonerate the NoTW from any suggestion 
that phone hacking had been more widespread than acknowledged.

7.43  The  PCC  also  used  the  report  as  an  opportunity  to  continue  its  advocacy  against  the 
introduction of custodial sentences for breaches of s55 of the Data Protection Act. Having 
suggested a number of steps which should be taken by newspapers to prevent abuses in the 
form of obtaining private data generally,234 the PCC concluded that:235

“The Commission believes very strongly that the impact of these initiatives should 
be  assessed  before  the  government  proceeds  with  its  proposals  to  increase  the 
penalties  for  journalists  who  breach  the  DPA  to  two  years  in  prison.  Such  a  move 
would be difficult to reconcile with notions of press freedom. The mere threat of a 
custodial sentence could be enough to deter journalists from embarking on legitimate 
investigations, despite reassurances about the public interest exemptions from the 
Information Commissioner.”

7.44  Press coverage of the 2007 report shows that one of the main points which, at least press 
observers  (some  of  whom  might  be  thought  to  have  had  something  of  a  vested  interest

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJof sorts) took from it was that the PCC had exonerated the NoTW from any suspicion that 
hacking was more widespread than had been conceded. Under the headline “News of the 
World in the clear over Clive Goodman case”, an article in the Guardian dated 18 May 2007 
reported that:236

“The Press Complaints Commission has effectively cleared the News of the World of 
any illegal conspiracy in the Clive Goodman royal phone hacking scandal.”

7.45  The effect of the PCC’s 2007 report was to take the heat out of calls for further investigation 
or reform of the system of self-regulation. In November 2007 Sir Christopher wrote to Tim 
Bowdler, then Chairman of PressBoF, in the following terms:237

“I have to say that … I was extremely worried by the possible political fall-out from 
the Goodman/Mulcaire case and the damage this could do to self-regulation. [The 
PCC’s  report  into  Subterfuge  and  Newsgathering]  put  a  premium  on  responding 
fast, comprehensively and effectively. Despite some carping at our decision not to 
interview Andy Coulson, the report has gone down well, effectively killing the case as 
an issue in Westminster and Whitehall. It has, as you know, been welcomed by the 
Government, the Opposition and the Select Committee; and, I believe, has contributed 
to the current and welcome bipartisan consensus behind self-regulation and against 
a privacy law, buttressed by the Prime Minister himself.”

7.46 

It  is  frankly  difficult  to  avoid  the  conclusion  that  with  the  publication  of  the  Report  on 
Subterfuge  and  Newsgathering,  not  only  was  yet  another  chance  for  the  self-regulatory 
system to reform itself was missed, but the PCC actively attempted to avoid external scrutiny 
that might have increased pressure for reform of the system from elsewhere.

2009 investigation

7.47  On 9 July 2009, the Guardian published an article entitled “Revealed: Murdoch’s £1m bill for 
hiding dirty tricks.”238 The substance of the article was that News Group Newspapers (NGN) 
had paid over the odds to settle phone hacking cases in order to try to secure confidentiality. 
The article revealed that one of the cases involved Gordon Taylor, the former Chief Executive 
of  the  Professional  Footballers  Association.  In  a  separate  comment  piece  printed  in  the 
Guardian on the same day, Mr Davies challenged the ‘one rogue reporter’ defence which 
had  been  advanced  by  News  Group  Newspapers  (NGN)  since  the  allegations  about  Clive 
Goodman’s conduct were revealed.

7.48 

In response to the allegations, the PCC issued a press statement announcing that it would 
seek further information about the allegations from the Guardian and from the Information 
Commissioner.239 The PCC did so and eventually prepared a report based on those findings 
published on 9 November 2009.240 The report was drafted by Mr Toulmin, with the conclusions 
in particular being approved by the Commission collectively.241 The 2009 report was withdrawn 
on 6 July 2011.

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness JWhy the PCC investigated

7.49  By  2009,  senior  figures  at  the  PCC  felt  obliged  to  try  to  assume  the  responsibilities  of  a 
regulator in relation to the phone hacking allegations which had, by then, grown in volume. 
Baroness Buscombe gave evidence that she felt obliged to make some sort of intervention 
because there was nobody else able to fulfil that role:242

“Q.  …you might have said ‘This is really only a complaints mechanism. This is nothing 
about regulation’”
A…at  the  time  we  felt  that  we  did  have  a  regulatory  role…to  perform.  There  was 
nothing else. There were no other layers that were, at the time, coming into play”.

The Investigation

7.50  The 2009 report sought to answer two questions. First, whether the PCC had been misled 
when  preparing  the  2007  report  and  in  particular  whether  there  was  any  evidence  that 
phone hacking was not confined to the single rogue reporter, Mr Goodman, acting through 
the agency of Mr Mulcaire. Secondly, the PCC sought to establish whether there was any 
evidence that phone message tapping had occurred since 2007.

7.51  Mr Toulmin wrote Mr Myler on two occasions in the course of the 2009 investigation: on 27 

July 2009243 and 3 September 2009.244

7.52  The first letter asked a series of questions which included references to: (a) the sentencing 
remarks  of  Mr  Justice  Gross  in  which  the  judge  referred  to  Mr  Mulcaire  dealing  with 
individuals at News International (NI) other than Mr Goodman; (b) the ‘for Neville’ email; (c) 
internal investigations at the NoTW following the arrest of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire in 
2006; (d) payments in relation to information supplied by Mr Mulcaire about Gordon Taylor; 
(e)  whether  the  NoTW  still  believed  that  the  ‘single  rogue  reporter’  line  was  the  correct 
interpretation of events.

7.53  Mr Myler sent a response on behalf of NGN by letter dated 5 August 2009.245 The substance 
of Mr Myler’s response was that the NoTW still believed that phone message tapping was 
the act of a single rogue reporter. Mr Myler dealt with the ‘for Neville’ email in the following 
way:246

“Our internal enquiries have found no evidence of involvement by News of the World 
staff  other  than  Clive  Goodman  in  phone  message  interception  beyond  the  email 
transcript which emerged in April 2008 during the Gordon Taylor litigation and which 
has since been revealed in the original Guardian report…
Email searches of relevant people, particularly the junior reporter [who sent the ‘for 
Neville’ email], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] failed to show any trace of the email 
being sent to or received by any other News of the World staff member.
Those who might have been connected to the relevant story, particularly [REDACTED] 
and [REDACTED], denied ever having seen or knowing about the relevant email and 
no evidence has been found which contradicts these assertions.”

1572

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJ7.54  Later in the same letter, Mr Myler responded to the direct question about why an email with 
the transcript of a message from Mr Taylor’s phone was entitled ‘for Neville’. Mr Myler gave 
the following response:247

“From June 2001 to April 2003 [REDACTED]...
During that time Glenn Mulcaire was hired to provide numerous services including 
land registry checks, credit status checks, electoral roll checks, directorship searches, 
court record checks, surveillance, and the provision of telephone numbers of sports 
stars from his vast database of personal contacts.”

7.55 

It is surprising that Mr Myler’s reply did not prompt further enquiries by the PCC. Given the 
ongoing criminal investigations, it is inappropriate for me to be too specific, but to explain the 
‘for Neville’ email in the context of Mr Mulcaire’s supposedly legitimate work for the NoTW 
appears to make little sense, given that there was the transcript of a hacked phone message 
attached. The failure to pick up on the inadequacy of this response and to seek to probe 
further was a clear flaw in the PCC’s investigation.

7.56  The PCC asked about Mr Justice Gross’s sentencing remarks both in the first letter dated 27 
July 2009 and in the second letter dated 3 September 2009. In his letter of 5 August, Mr Myler 
gave a short response to the point, saying that the NoTW could not explain to what Mr Justice 
Gross was referring.248 In his reply to the second letter, Mr Myler simply said that Mr Mulcaire 
had had contact with several NoTW reporters on the point.249

7.57  The PCC did not have power to compel anyone to disclose relevant documents or to gain 
access to relevant records. Nor did they ask for any such documents or access. Further, when 
investigating whether or not they had been misled in 2007, the PCC relied on the honesty and 
thoroughness of executives at the organisation alleged to have misled them.

7.58  The PCC press release covering the publication of the 2009 report, issued on 9 November 

2009, contained the following paragraph:250

“The PCC received information from a number of sources. It found no evidence that 
it  was  materially  misled  by  the  News  of  the  World,  and  no  evidence  that  phone 
message hacking is ongoing. The Guardian’s sources suggesting a greater culture of 
intrusion at the News of the World were anonymous and could not be tested, while the 
Commission noted that there were ‘a significant number of on the record statements 
from those who have conducted inquiries, and have first-hand knowledge of events 
at the newspaper’ who were prepared to state a contrary position.”

7.59 

In addition to asking questions of Mr Myler, the PCC also asked for evidence from the solicitor 
Mark Lewis,251 from Mr Davies,252 from Mick Gorrill of the Information Commissioner’s Office,253 
and from Mark Maberly, the policeman with whom Mr Lewis had had a conversation about 
the extent of phone hacking.254 Mr Maberly did not respond. The PCC also had access to the 
evidence given by, among others, Mr Lewis and Mr Davies to the CMS Select Committee in

1573

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness Jwhich both gave their reasons for believing that phone hacking was more widespread than 
had previously emerged.255

7.60  The PCC also relied upon the public statements of Assistant Commissioners John Yates and 
Andy Hayman.256 The evidence of the police that there had only been a handful of phone 
hacking victims was set against the evidence from, among others, Mr Lewis that there had 
been up to 6,000.257 Of course, the number of alleged victims was closely linked to the issue 
of how many perpetrators there had been.

7.61  Mr Davies, among other things, told the PCC that he was not able to reveal all of the sources 
of his stories about the extent of phone hacking because of the fear voiced by some people 
when dealing with a powerful organisation such as NI.258 Mr Gorrill was not able to supply 
the PCC with information flowing from the Motorman investigation because the information 
seized was personal information.259

7.62  The  PCC  did  not  ask  for  disclosure  of  documents  from  the  NoTW,  or  any  other  form  of 
documentary evidence. Whereas there was no formal power allowing the PCC to demand 
disclosure of key documents from NGN, there was nothing to stop the PCC asking to see such 
documents. Had NGN refused, it was open to the PCC to make that public, and take any such 
refusal into account when publishing its conclusions on the back of the 2009 investigation.

7.63  The 2009 report concluded:260

“The PCC has seen no new evidence to suggest that the practice of phone message 
tapping was undertaken by others beyond Goodman and Mulcaire, or evidence that 
News  of  the  World  executives  knew  about  Goodman  and  Mulcaire’s  activities.  It 
follows that there is nothing to suggest that the PCC was materially misled during its 
2007 inquiry”.

7.64  The  2009  report’s  conclusions  preferred  the  accounts  of  the  police  to  the  allegations  of 

widespread phone hacking contained in the Guardian:261

“Set against the Guardian’s anonymous sources are a significant number of on the 
record  statements  from  those  who  have  conducted  inquiries,  and  have  first  hand 
knowledge  of  events  at  the  newspaper.  While  people  may  speculate  about  the 
email referencing ‘Neville’, the Taylor settlement, and the termination payments to 
Mulcaire and Goodman, the PCC can only deal with facts available rather than make 
assumptions.”

7.65  The 2009 report concluded by observing that:262

“…the Commission could not help but conclude that the Guardian’s stories did not 
quite live up to the dramatic billing they were initially given. Perhaps this was because 
the sources could not be tested; or because Nick Davies was unable to shed further 
light of the suggestions of a broader conspiracy at the newspaper; or because there 
was  significant  evidence  to  the  contrary  from  the  police;  or  because  much  of  the

PART J | Aspects of Regulation: The Law and the Press Complaints CommissionJinformation was old and had already appeared in the public domain (or a combination 
of these factors). Whatever the reason, there did not seem to be anything concrete to 
support the implication that there had been a hitherto concealed criminal conspiracy 
at the News of the World to intrude into people’s privacy”.

7.66  The PCC might reasonably have concluded that there was insufficient evidence for it firmly 
to say that its investigation in 2007 had been misled. However, to conclude that there was 
nothing to suggest that the 2007 investigation had been misled was to ignore at least four 
significant facts from which inferences might reasonably have been drawn casting doubt on 
the ‘one rogue reporter’ defence.

7.67  The  first  of  these  facts  was  the  so  called  ‘for  Neville’  email.  The  second  was  Mr  Taylor’s 
settlement which was for a very large (some might say an astonishingly large) sum. Third, 
evidence  from  Mr  Lewis  of  his  conversation  with  a  police  officer  suggesting  that  phone 
message tapping was much more widespread than had previously been made public. Fourth, 
there  were  the  sentencing  remarks  of  Mr  Justice  Gross  in  the  Goodman  and  Mulcaire 
prosecution (to which one might add the words of both prosecuting and defence counsel). 
It  would  have  been  reasonable  for  the  PCC  to  conclude  that  none  of  these  facts,  taken 
individually or collectively, proved for certain that it had been misled in the course of their 
2007 investigation, but there was certainly reason to believe that it might have been.

7.68  On the question of whether there was ongoing phone message interception, the 2009 report 

concluded that:263

“…there  is  no  evidence  that  the  practice  of  phone  message  tapping  is  ongoing. 
The  Commission  is  satisfied  that  –  so  far  as  it  is  possible  to  tell  –  its  work  aimed 
at  improving  the  integrity  of  undercover  journalism  has  played  its  part  in  raising 
standards in this area”.

7.69  Baroness Buscombe gave evidence that she was not comfortable with the conclusion reached 
in the 2009 Report that “the Guardian’s stories did not quite live up to the dramatic billing 
they were initially given”.264 However, she was equally uncomfortable about the PCC failing 
to come to a conclusion:265

“If we’d done nothing…and I know some have said we should just have said, ‘Sorry we 
can’t do anything.’ I’ve tried to imagine the reaction if we’d said that and we’re calling 
ourselves the PCC and we’re trying to be credible.
I thought – unless we can probably [sic] investigate, perhaps we shouldn’t have done 
anything, but on the other hand if we’d done nothing we would have been accused of 
being useless for doing nothing. It’s very, very difficult”.

Reaction to the 2009 report

7.70  There was a strong response to the 2009 Report from the Guardian.  Editor in  Chief, Alan 
Rusbridger, resigned from the Editors’ Code Committee in protest. Mr Davies gave evidence 
that the 2009 report caused him  to  change from  being  a supporter of  the self-regulatory 
system to being an opponent:266

Chapter 4 | The Press Complaints Commission and its Effectiveness J“We published the Gordon Taylor story in July, and in November, the PCC published 
the second report on phone hacking. Different personnel, different chair. The former 
– well, I think the same director, but the man who is now director was involved in the 
production of that report, Stephen Abell, who I regard as a good man.
But the report was terrible. Just an awful piece of work. You know, my editor resigned 
from the code committee in protest. He went on the radio and said, ‘This is worse than 
useless’, which I think was an understatement. And that shifted me across the line. I 
just think – I do not trust this industry to regulate itself. I say this as I love reporting. I 
want us to be free … But it obviously doesn’t work. We’re kidding ourselves if we think 
it would, because it hasn’t.
Q.  This  is  the  report,  which  is  no  longer  on  the  PCC  website,  which  referred  to,  I 
paraphrase, some of the Guardian’s more dramatic claims not being borne out by the 
evidence or words to that effect?
A.  Yes, and along the way there was some slippery behaviour, slippery handling of 
evidence.”

7.71  Thus the effect of the 2009 investigation was to alienate and anger the sole newspaper which 
had taken this issue seriously. The report and a subsequent speech by Baroness Buscombe to 
the Society of Editors,267 also angered Mr Taylor’s former solicitor Mr Lewis to the extent that 
he successfully pursued proceedings for libel.

7.72 

It was not too late, even in 2009, for the PCC to have been more open with the public and 
to  have  said  that  it  lacked  the  powers  and  was  not  competent  to  carry  out  an  effective 
investigation  into  allegations  of  phone  hacking.  That  would  have  avoided  the  danger  that 
politicians, the public and potential claimants might conclude that a competent regulator had 
investigated the allegations and found them to be baseless. It is completely unconvincing to 
contend that the PCC had to be seen to do something in order to maintain public confidence 
in the self-regulatory system. There was no public interest in the PCC purporting to exonerate 
the NoTW when it did not have the proper evidence to do so, still less to uphold the values 
of  self-regulation.  In  particular  as  regards  the  disparaging  conclusion  about  the  Guardian, 
the PCC was clearly taking an enormous risk. That risk was that the situation would speedily 
unravel against it if (as happened) it was contradicted by subsequent events.

7.73  The immediate consequence of the PCC’s failed investigation, as with the 2007 report, was to 
dampen down calls for further investigation. The continued pursuit of the issue by journalists 
such as Mr Davies, solicitors like Mr Lewis and a handful of politicians meant that the issue 
would  not  be  buried.  However,  the  PCC’s  contribution  to  the  phone  hacking  saga  seeped 
into the political arena: for example, the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP, gave 
evidence that in deciding to employ Mr Coulson, he relied in part on the reports of the PCC.268

8.  Conclusions
8.1 

The  PCC  is  constrained  by  serious  structural  deficiencies  which  limit  what  it  can  do.  The 
power  of  PressBoF  in  relation  to  appointments,  the  Code  Committee  and  the  funding  of 
the PCC means that the PCC is far from being an independent body. The lack of universal 
coverage, most notably after the withdrawal of the Northern and Shell titles from the self-

regulatory system in January 2011, gave cause for observers and complainants to lose faith 
in the system.269

The PCC is barely given enough money to perform its key function of complaints handling, 
let alone to expand its activities in order to raise standards across the board. Funding has 
been an issue for some time; almost a decade ago the CMS Select Committee recommended 
that PressBoF heed a plea from Sir Christopher for additional funding.270 In more recent years 
Baroness Buscombe was obviously concerned about funding levels but does not appear to 
have made formal requests for additional funding.271

The PCC has been seen to associate itself with the interests of the press, has lobbied for the 
press on key policy issues, and has acted as a shield against moves which might threaten the 
status quo. Minor changes to the Editors’ Code of Practice and the self-regulatory system 
has been deployed as a substitute for real, substantial reform which might have improved 
press standards and provided a real basis for trust in self-regulation. The PCC has expressed 
a willingness to listen to constructive criticism but has consistently displayed a reluctance to 
act upon it.

The  failure  by  the  PCC  to  initiate  its  own  investigations  –  other  than  in  circumstances 
where an investigation was needed to head off criticism of the press or self-regulation – or 
to  accept  complaints  from  third  parties  across  the  board  and  on  a  transparent  basis,  has 
meant that the PCC is not able to act as a regulator properly so called. It has also meant 
that bodies representing the interests of groups or minorities cannot complain to the PCC 
about discriminatory or inaccurate coverage. These are points which have been repeatedly 
identified as a weakness in the self-regulatory system.

The failure by the PCC to investigate where press actions might give rise to a criminal charge or 
civil claim is a limitation on its effectiveness. The resources of the police are limited; similarly, 
resource restraints mean that individuals often cannot afford to proceed with a civil action. 
Even where there were prima facie serious breaches of the Editors’ Code of Practice, the PCC 
typically failed to take any steps to investigate. Examples of this (including alleged payments 
to police officers) emerged before the CMS Select Committee in their hearings leading to the 
2003 report, and the Select Committee at that stage made clear its view that the PCC should 
investigate allegations of this type.272

8.6  When the PCC failed to initiate an investigation over newspaper coverage of the McCann 
case, once again the CMS Select Committee criticised the PCC for this failure.273 That report 
concluded:274

“In any other industry suffering such a collective breakdown – as for example in the 
banking sector now – any regulator worth its salt would have instigated an enquiry. 
The press, indeed, would have been clamouring for it to do so. It is an indictment on 
the PCC’s record, that it signally failed to do so.”

8.8 

8.9 

The PCC does not have sufficient powers to investigate alleged breaches of the Code. As the 
Joint  Committee  on  Privacy  and  Injunctions  concluded,  this  meant  that  the  PCC  “was  not 
equipped to deal with systemic and illegal invasions of privacy”.275 In particular, it does not have 
powers to demand the production of documents or to run investigations which strike at the 
heart of complaints. At every step it has to trust that newspapers are properly examining the 
issues and are not being economical with the truth. In relation to its investigations into phone 
hacking, it is common ground that it was misled. In addition and in any event, it did not use the 
powers which it had to best effect. For example, it did not initiate investigations as often as it 
might have done nor did it hold oral hearings to determine cases, despite having the power to. 
Once again, these points were picked up in the CMS Select Committee’s 2003 Report.276

The weaknesses in the PCC’s powers and its reluctance to seek to compel newspapers to 
get to the truth were exposed by its inaction after the ICO’s reports arising from Operation 
Motorman, and in the 2007 and 2009 reports into phone hacking.

The  PCC  does  not  have  adequate  sanctions  to  dissuade  newspapers  from  repeating  their 
transgressions and satisfy complainants that the wrongs against them have been redressed. 
Negotiated apologies, published adjudications and letters to proprietors are not in themselves 
adequate to prevent reoffending. The lack of a power to fine, even in relation to serious and 
systemic breaches of the code, has meant that the PCC is not a body whose adjudications 
have force against the industry.

8.10  These points have been consistently picked up in external reviews of the PCC’s performance. 
The CMS Select Committee’s 2003 report recommended that a system of fines be introduced, 
as well as a strengthening of the sanctions already in place.277 The CMS Select Committee’s 
2007 report into self-regulation of the press also heard evidence that some complaints were 
not satisfied with the strength of sanctions; that there were not enough adjudications given, as 
distinct from negotiated settlements; and recommended that the issue of fines be considered 
further.278 The failure to identify for public consumption the number of breaches of the Code 
that the PCC concluded had occurred serves to preserve an erroneous impression of the level 
of compliance with the Code.

8.11 

In  addition,  the  evidence  overall  demonstrates  that  complainants  to  the  PCC  tend  to  feel 
pressurised into accepting a negotiated settlement rather than having a decision made on 
whether or not there has been a breach of the Editors’ Code. This failing was identified by 
witnesses  who  gave evidence  to  the  CMS  Select  Committee in  preparation  for  their  2003 
report:279

“There  was  a  great  deal  of  praise  for  the  staff  of  the  Commission  in  assisting 
complainants through the process but there was also a backdrop of frustration that 
nothing  was  going  to  change  and  nothing  was  going  to  happen  to  an  offending 
newspaper.  In  one  case,  the  witness  encapsulated  the  feelings  of  many  in  saying 
that, even though she had, eventually, won the argument and got an apology, she

that someone else would not get the same treatment…The complainant told us: ‘I 
never had the sense … that at any time anybody actually sat down and made any 
decisions about it.’ She described the to and fro of letters and added ‘I kept saying 
‘I press you to adjudicate’ … but, in fact I was pressed to accept the final offer of 
The Daily Mail, which was to publish an apology on page 31.’ This experience seems 
at odds with the PCC’s stated policy that ‘complainants can of course at any stage 
ask the Commission itself to take a formal view on their complaint’ Another witness 
described the complaints process as like climbing a staircase with ‘the Commission’ 
as the ‘big thing in the sky’. However, he told us ‘You get to the top of the steps, you 
are looking around, and ‘it’ is not there’”.

8.12  The failings which have fatally undermined the PCC and caused policy makers and the public 
to lose trust in the self-regulatory system are not new. They have been consistently identified 
by external scrutiny for at least a decade. The twin failure of both the self-regulatory system 
and the industry to address these problems is itself evidence that there has been no real 
appetite for an effective and adequate system of regulation from within the industry, in spite 
of a professed openness to reform and self-criticism. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that 
the self-regulatory system was run for the benefit of the press not of the public.

8.13 

In the circumstances, it is not surprising that change is inevitable. On 9 March 2012, there 
was a press release to the effect that the PCC had unanimously agreed in principle to the 
proposal that it will now move into a transitional phase, transferring its assets, liabilities and 
staff to a new regulatory body.

Introduction
In order to make recommendations for a new more effective regulatory regime, as required by 
the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry, it is essential first to consider what a regulatory regime 
should be seeking to achieve. There are three aspects to this question: first, what a regulatory 
regime should do; second, how it should be structured to achieve that; and third, the detailed 
rules that are put in place to achieve the objectives. The ‘what’ is about outcomes and the 
‘how’ is about processes, structures and accountabilities. The detailed rules should be dealt 
with in the substance of any code or regulations. These three aspects of a regulatory regime 
need to be considered separately as they are not necessarily dependent on each other and 
it may be possible to achieve the desired objectives by different combinations of solutions.

1.2 

This chapter is specifically about the ‘what’. In May 2012 I published on the Inquiry website 
a  set  of  draft  criteria  for  a  regulatory  solution  that  aimed  to  set  out  what  any  regulatory 
solution should seek to achieve. This was not concerned with how those outcomes should 
be achieved, or the structures through which they should be achieved, but simply what the 
outcomes should be. Those draft criteria were:

“1.  Effectiveness
1.1  Any solution must be perceived as effective and credible both by the press as an 
industry and by the public:

(a) It must strike a balance, capable of being accepted as reasonable, legitimate 

and in the public interest by all.

(b) It  must  recognise  the  importance  for  the  public  interest  of  a  free  press  in 
a  democracy,  freedom  of  expression  and  investigative  journalism,  the  rule 
of  law,  personal  privacy  and  other  private  rights,  and  a  press  which  acts 
responsibly and in the public interest.

(c)  It must promote a clear understanding of ‘the public interest’ which would be 

accepted as reasonable by press, industry and public alike.

(d) It  must  be  durable  and  sufficiently  flexible  to  work  for  future  markets  and 

technology, and be capable of universal application.

2.  Fairness and objectivity of Standards
2.1  There must be a statement of ethical standards which is recognised as reasonable 
by the industry and credible by the public. This statement must identify enforceable 
minimum standards as well as articulating good practice that should be aimed for.
2.2  All  standards  for  good  practice  in  journalism  should  be  driven  by  the  public 
interest and must be benchmarked in a clear objective way to the public interest. 
2.3  The setting of standards must be independent of government and parliament, 
and sufficiently independent of media interests, in order to command public respect.
3.  Independence and transparency of enforcement and compliance
3.1  Enforcement of ethical standards, by whatever mechanism, must be operationally 
independent of government and parliament, and sufficiently independent of media 
interests, in order to command public respect.

1583

K3.2  In particular all relevant appointments processes must be sufficiently independent 
of government, Parliament and media interests to command public support.
3.3  Compliance  must  be  the  responsibility  of  editors  and  transparent  and 
demonstrable to the public.
4.  Powers and remedies
4.1  The  system  must  provide  credible  remedies,  both  in  respect  of  aggrieved 
individuals and in respect of issues affecting wider groups in society.
4.2  The regulatory regime must have effective investigatory and advisory powers.
4.3  The system should also actively support and promote compliance by the industry, 
both  directly  (for  example  by  providing  confidential  pre-publication  advice)  and 
indirectly (for example by kitemarking titles’ own internal systems).
4.4  The  system  should  be  a  good  fit  with  other  relevant  regulatory  and  law 
enforcement functions.
5.  Cost
5.1  The  solution  must  be  sufficiently  reliably  financed  to  allow  for  reasonable 
operational 
independence  and  appropriate  scope,  but  without  placing  a 
disproportionate burden on either the industry, complainants or the taxpayer.”

1.3 

I sought comments on these draft criteria. Most of those who have submitted evidence on 
regulation  have  accepted  the  criteria  without  comment.  Some,  including  Ofcom,1  made 
substantive comments on the criteria, suggesting that further consideration was needed on 
a number of areas. Where appropriate, I address these comments later in this Chapter. I am, 
however, satisfied that the broad categories are correct and they continue to form the basis 
of what I would hope could be achieved through the recommendations set out later in this 
part of the Report.

2.	 Effectiveness
2.1 

The ultimate test of any new regime is that it must work in practice, in terms of ensuring 
that  the  press  comply  with  agreed  standards.  But  that  simple  statement  itself  begs  three 
questions. The first is what is meant by ‘ensuring’; the second, what is meant by ‘the press’; 
and the third is what is meant by ‘agreed standards’. I address all of these points in this section 
of the report. The Inquiry has heard over and over again that aspects of the current PCC based 
regime may be good in principle but that they simply do not work in practice. The essential 
flaws of the current regime have been examined elsewhere.2 At one fundamental level, the 
current  ‘self-regulatory’  regime  has  failed  to  achieve  continued  universal  coverage  of  the 
main national newspaper titles with the withdrawal of Northern and Shell. I do not consider 
that it is possible for a regime to be considered effective if a major national newspaper group 
can choose to sit outside it without consequences. This should not be a controversial view, as 
it essentially echoes Lord Hunt’s opinion that:3 

“the credibility of the new system could be fatally undermined if any genuinely big 
fish seek to escape the net.”

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK2.2 

2.3 

2.4 

Lord Hunt went on to confirm that Northern and Shell would qualify as a ‘big fish’ in this 
context.4 The very fact that the industry has sought to put forward what it believes to be a 
new and fundamentally different approach to self-regulation constitutes a clear recognition 
that the existing regime is no longer effective.

Other aspects of external regulation, including the criminal and the civil law, have significant 
structural  weaknesses,  as  is  more  fully  discussed  elsewhere  in  the  Report.5  An  effective 
regulatory regime will need to take account of those shortcomings and find ways of rectifying 
them or otherwise dealing with them as far as possible. 

There  are  a  number  of  different  aspects  of  effectiveness.  Views  on  what  constitutes 
effectiveness vary, but the broad headings included within the draft criteria have not been 
contested. The draft criteria indicated that, in order to be effective, a regulatory regime for 
the press must be accepted as credible both by the press and the public and this proposition 
has not been seriously disputed by anyone. This does not mean that either the industry or 
interest  groups  should  have  a  veto  over  the  solution,  but  it  is  important  that  the  regime 
should be grounded in an understanding of the industry, the law, the rights and freedoms of 
both individuals and the press, and the public interest in its widest sense. A regime that fails 
to take any of those factors fully into account will fail to meet the expectations and needs of 
the public.

The  draft  criteria  set  out  a  broad  perspective  on  the  public  interest.  As  with  the  concept 
of  effectiveness,  there  are  many  different  aspects  to  the  public  interest  in  this  context. 
The  public  interest  in  the  freedom  of  the  press  and  freedom  of  expression,  including  the 
public interest in a diverse and vibrant press, are the most obvious. Any regulatory regime 
that compromised the freedom of the press to hold authority to account, or to investigate 
wrongdoing  by  the  powerful,  would  not  qualify  as  effective  according  to  any  reasonable 
person’s definition of that term. The public interest in the rule of law is also important. The 
law  applies  to  journalists  and  the  press  as  it  applies  to  everybody  else.  This  is  not  to  say 
that journalists cannot sometimes break the law in the pursuit of public interest journalism, 
but that does not override the general public interest in the rule of law: on the contrary, 
it  recognises  that  a  clear  countervailing  public  interest  must  be  identified  before  the  rule 
of law may yield. Finally, there is a public interest in the protection of the private rights of 
individuals, including the right to privacy, which falls to be weighed in the balance against 
the public interest in free speech. Providing this requisite balance is one of the most difficult 
challenges for any regulatory regime.

2.5 

The Inquiry has heard evidence that different editors weigh up these countervailing public 
interests in different ways. That may not be unreasonable looking at individual cases alone, but 
from an enforcement perspective it is only fair for both the public and the press themselves 
that each relevant enforcement authority should be clear about the basis on which they will 
reach such judgments. It also seems reasonable that, if there is to be a body adjudicating on 
press or media standards, such a body should set out for the public and the industry some 
guidance on what might be meant by the public interest in this context. The PCC Code, as most 
recently revised, sets out the following non-exhaustive definition of the public interest: 6 7

Chapter 1 | Criteria for a Regulatory SolutionK“The public interest
There may be exceptions to the clauses marked * where they can be demonstrated to 
be in the public interest.
1.  The public interest includes, but is not confined to: 

(i)    Detecting or exposing crime or serious impropriety. 
(ii)    Protecting public health and safety.
(iii)    Preventing  the  public  from  being  misled  by  an  action  or  statement  of  an 

individual or organisation.

2.  There is a public interest in freedom of expression itself.
3.  Whenever the public interest is invoked, the PCC will require editors to demonstrate 
fully that they reasonably believed that publication, or journalistic activity undertaken 
with a view to publication, would be in the public interest and how, and with whom, 
that was established at the time.
4.  The PCC will consider the extent to which material is already in the public domain, 
or will become so.
5.  In  cases  involving  children  under  16,  editors  must  demonstrate  an  exceptional 
public interest to over-ride the normally paramount interest of the child.”

2.6 

There are a number of references to the public interest in the Ofcom Broadcasting Code.8 
There is no definition of the public interest as such, but the code does provide this:

“Examples of public interest would include revealing or detecting crime, protecting 
public  health  or  safety,  exposing  misleading  claims  made  by  individuals  or 
organisations or disclosing incompetence that affects the public.”

2.7 

The BBC includes a definition of the public interest in its editorial guidelines:9

“The Public Interest
Private  behaviour,  information,  correspondence  and  conversation  should  not  be 
brought into the public domain unless there is a public interest that outweighs the 
expectation of privacy.  There is no single definition of public interest.  It includes but 
is not confined to:

•  exposing or detecting crime 
•  exposing significantly anti-social behaviour 
•  exposing corruption or injustice 
•  disclosing significant incompetence or negligence 
•  protecting people’s health and safety 
•  preventing  people  from  being  misled  by  some  statement  or  action  of  an 

individual or organisation 

•  disclosing  information  that  assists  people  to  better  comprehend  or  make

When  considering  what  is  in  the  public  interest  we  also  need  to  take  account  of 
information already in the public domain or about to become available to the public. 
When using the public interest to justify an intrusion, consideration should be given 
to proportionality; the greater the intrusion, the greater the public interest required 
to justify it.”

Although  these  definitions,  or  examples,  have  a  lot  in  common  there  are  naturally  some 
differences. Views have been advanced on each of them, but it is not for this Inquiry to draft a 
comprehensive working definition: this would be both an overly ambitious and inappropriate 
exercise. However, given that this is the public interest, and that it must explicitly relate to 
interests outside those of the media enterprise concerned, it must be reasonable to conclude 
that whatever interpretation of the public interest is to be used in a new regulatory regime, it 
should be recognised, understood and accepted by both the media and the public. 

Finally  on  the  question  of  effectiveness,  the  criteria  spoke  of  a  durable  solution,  and  one 
sufficiently flexible to work in the future. It is, of course, the case that, as many witnesses 
have  told  the  Inquiry,  the  media  market  is  changing.  Rupert  Murdoch  predicted  that  the 
printed  press  might  coexist  with  online  news  sources  for  possibly  20  years,  but  he  also 
commented that others estimated that the print versions may not survive for more than five 
or ten years.10 Without needing to take a view on how long the printed press will survive, it 
is unquestionably the case that a large proportion of people now receive at least some of 
their news and current affairs content, and their entertainment, from the internet. Ofcom 
estimated that 41% of people today use the internet for news and current affairs coverage, 
and that the internet accounts for 21% of news and current affairs consumption; this compares 
with 53% of adults using a newspaper, but newspapers account for only 11% of news and 
current affairs consumption.11 Furthermore, the trend towards online consumption is rising. 
This makes it abundantly clear that, for a regulatory regime to be effective, it must be capable 
of delivering any perceived benefits to online publication as much as to print. 

2.10  The Inquiry has also received evidence that a single regulatory regime across all media would 
be desirable.12 The Inquiry has heard some evidence on the nature and effectiveness of the 
existing statutory regulatory framework for broadcast media; but this has been largely for the 
purposes of comparison with the regime currently in place for print and to learn any relevant 
lessons. I have not sought to take evidence on the adequacy of the regime for the broadcast 
sector and, accordingly, it is not my intention to examine the fitness of that regulatory regime, 
or to make any recommendations as to how the broadcast sector should be regulated.

2.11  Ofcom correctly commented that the published draft criteria did not mention membership.13 
The criteria aimed to set out what a new regulatory regime should achieve, not the means by 
which it should be achieved. The draft criteria provide that a new solution should be ‘capable 
of universal application’. My starting point, as set out above, is that any regime which did not 
at the very least cover all major national newspapers and their online presence, would not be

Chapter 1 | Criteria for a Regulatory SolutionKeffective. The Inquiry has received submissions suggesting that standards regulation might be 
limited to those of a particular size or with particular economic power.14 Ofcom say:15

“Committed  participation  by  the  whole  of  industry  would  be  fundamental  to  a 
successful new regulatory regime”

It has been made abundantly clear in the proposals presented during Module Four of the 
Inquiry that the vast majority of interested parties agreed with that. All the proposals that have 
come to the table have sought to compel or entice the whole of industry into the tent. Any 
disagreement has been about whether compelling or enticing is the best way to achieve the 
objective of committed participation, coupled with what have been described as principled 
concerns about the use of legislation to compel any part of the press to do anything. I have no 
doubt that committed participation by the whole of industry is fundamental to an effective 
new regime. 

2.12  My conclusion is that Criteria 1 as originally drafted continues to reflect the essential elements 

of a new effective regime.

3.	 Fairness	and	objectivity	of	standards
3.1 

The  draft  Criteria  set  out  three  aspects  of  fairness  and  objectivity  of  standards  which  I 
considered were fitting attributes of a new regulatory regime. The first was that there should 
be a statement of ethical standards which is recognised as reasonable by the industry and as 
credible by the public. This statement must identify enforceable minimum standards as well 
as articulating the good practice that should be targeted. 

3.2 

The Inquiry has not undertaken a full systematic examination of the existing Editors’ Code 
but it has identified some deficiencies that have been identified in evidence presented to the 
Inquiry.16 Many witnesses have maintained that it is a good Code; others have argued that 
it has weaknesses. In this context I simply note that the current Editors’ Code appears to be 
a mix of broad statements of principle (for example “the press, whilst free to be partisan, 
must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact”); specific requirements (for 
example  “even  where  the  law  does  not  prohibit  it,  journalists  must  not  use  for  their  own 
profit financial information they receive in advance of its general publication to others, not 
should  they  pass  such  information  to  others”);  and  requirements  that  can  sometimes  be 
disregarded (e.g. “the press must not identify victims of sexual assault or publish material 
likely to contribute to such identification unless there is adequate justification and they are 
legally free to do so”). In addition, there are examples of each of these types of statement 
which can be disapplied where doing so can be demonstrated to be in the public interest. 
Professor Megone commented that a code of practice needs to be presented in the context 
of the specific critical contribution that a free press can make to the public interest. Overall, 
there is room for improvement of the current Code. 17

3.3 

Second under this broad heading, the draft Criteria specified:

3.5 

“All standards for good practice in journalism should be driven by the public interest 
and must be benchmarked in a clear objective way to the public interest.”

Associated  News  Limited  (ANL)  have  raised  a  concern  about  this,  stating  that  the  press 
should  be  free  to  publish  material  of  their  choice  without  always  having  to  justify  it  on 
grounds of public interest. I accept entirely that the vast majority of material published in 
most newspapers and magazines will not infringe other peoples’ rights or the law and has 
no need to be justified on public interest, or any other, grounds. It was not the intention in 
these draft criteria to suggest that all material in a newspaper should be able to pass a public 
interest test. However, ANL also raised the issue of “information which might be thought to 
constitute a low-level interference with personal privacy” and, in the same context, observed 
that  standards  of  this  sort  “would  constrain  newspapers  from  providing  the  broad  mix  of 
newspaper  that…….ensures  the  very  survival  of  the  industry.” 18  Here,  the  authorities  do 
recognise that a minimum threshold of interference must be attained before the right itself 
may be said to be infringed. Exactly how this should be formulated would be for any future 
code-maker to consider. Subject to that, any infringement of the substantive right must be 
justified. 

Finally  under  this  heading,  the  criteria  specified  that  the  setting  of  standards  must  be 
independent of Government and Parliament, and sufficiently independent of media interests 
in order to command public respect. In some ways this has sparked the most debate. Whilst 
there is universal agreement on the principle of the independent setting, there are also many 
proposals that would see Parliament laying down some basic criteria which such standards 
must attain. This is the case with, for example, the Irish Defamation Act, which has been cited 
by many as a successful example of how Government can incentivise independent regulation. 
There  is  also  disagreement  about  what  constitutes  ‘sufficient’  independence  of  media 
interests. Lord Black on behalf of the industry proposed a system in which serving editors 
still had a majority on the committee which set the standards,19 whereas Ofcom, by contrast, 
considered it to be “unimaginable” to have anyone currently active within the industry as 
part of the standards setting body.20

3.6 

It  would  therefore  appear  that,  whilst  everyone  is  willing  to  support  the  theory  of 
independence, it is difficult to find any particular consensus on what independence looks like 
in practice.

3.7  My  conclusion  is  that  Criteria  2  as  drafted  remains  the  right  articulation  of  fairness  and 
objectivity of standards, but with an explicit recognition that not all material published in 
newspapers would or should need to satisfy a public interest test as opposed to providing 
material  which  merely  entertains  or  interests  the  public.  The  standards  must,  however, 
recognise that any infringement of individual rights should only be acceptable where there is 
a sufficient public interest rationale.

Chapter 1 | Criteria for a Regulatory SolutionK4.	

4.1 

4.2 

4.3 

Independence	and	transparency	of	enforcement	and	
compliance
The  draft  Criteria  provided  that  enforcement  of  ethical  standards  must  be  operationally 
independent of Government and Parliament and sufficiently independent of media interests. 
This,  by  contrast  with  the  setting  of  standards,  has  proved  relatively  uncontroversial.  All 
the proposals put forward to the Inquiry included an independent approach to complaint 
handling, and most attempted to describe a broader independent standards enforcement 
role. There were, inevitably, different views on what constitutes independence, but at a level 
of principle this seems to be genuinely uncontentious.

The draft Criteria also provided that all relevant appointments processes must be sufficiently 
independent of Government, Parliament and media interests. This raises the basic conundrum 
of who appoints the appointers. None of those who have provided evidence to the Inquiry 
have suggested that the appointments processes should not be sufficiently independent of 
the interests listed, but there are differences around what constitutes ‘sufficiently’, and at 
what level the independence needs to be demonstrated. By way of example, in the proposal 
from Tim Suter, the Ofcom Content Board would need to approve the independence of the 
appointment  process  for  any  self-regulator,  whilst  the  Content  Board21  itself  is  appointed 
by  the  Ofcom  Board,  which  is  appointed  by  Government.22  Lord  Black’s  proposal,  on  the 
other hand, would rely on an appointment committee composed half and half of industry 
appointees and lay members to appoint the Chair of a new regulator. I do not accept that 
an appointment procedure that allows an effective veto to the industry could be considered 
to be sufficiently independent. Similarly, it must be the case that in relation both to specific 
enforcement  and  overarching  standards  compliance  the  operation  and  decisions  of  the 
regulator are fully independent from those being regulated.

Finally  under  this  heading,  the  draft  Criteria  specified  that  compliance  must  be  the 
responsibility  of  editors,  and  must  be  transparent  and  demonstrable  to  the  public.  One 
of  the  strong  themes  emerging  from  the  proposals  submitted  to  the  Inquiry  was  the 
emphasis on the need for companies to take more responsibility internally for compliance 
and for dealing with complaints about standards. This is addressed in Lord Black’s proposal 
through the presumption that all complaints should be dealt with in the first instance by the 
company concerned, the requirement for a named senior executive to have responsibility for 
compliance and the requirement for each regulated entity to provide an annual compliance 
report. There may be some question as to whether it is specifically the editor, as opposed for 
instance to the managing editor, who should be responsible for compliance; but the Inquiry 
has seen nothing to suggest that the principle underlying this criteria has anything other than 
full support.

4.4  My conclusion is that Criteria 3 as drafted remains an appropriate benchmark for independence.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.	 Powers	and	remedies
5.1 

The draft Criteria indicated that an effective new regime must provide credible remedies, 
both in respect of individuals and of issues affecting wider groups in society. The concept 
of ‘credible remedies’ has been the subject of some debate. For many, the publication of 
an agreed correction or apology constitutes a credible remedy; for others it does not. The 
draft Criteria made no mention of sanctions, as opposed to remedies, but there have been 
representations suggesting that a new regulatory regime should include sanctions, including 
power to fine, as well as remedies in respect of particularly serious or systemic breaches.23 I 
freely accept the argument that sanctions are different in kind to remedies, in that the former 
aim to punish and deter breaches of standards, whilst the latter aim to provide solace for the 
individual affected. I further accept that an effective regulatory regime must have some form 
of sanction, at least for systemic or egregious breaches of standards.

5.2 

There is broad agreement that there must be a system of credible remedies for individuals who 
have been adversely affected by a breach of standards. However, there are widely differing 
views when it comes to the rights of third parties or groups of people to make complaints or 
have access to remedies. In relation to third parties, there is a clear, and reasonable, concern 
about the risk of such persons or groups making a complaint where the individual directly 
concerned either is not troubled by the article or, more realistically, would prefer to let the 
matter  drop.  Some  have  argued  that  the  subject  of  an  article  should  have  a  veto  on  the 
consideration of a complaint. Plainly, a number of issues arise here. If the system is based 
solely on remedies then there is little point in taking a complaint from anyone for whom 
the range of potential remedies would not be meaningful. Ofcom has argued that, if there 
has been a breach of regulatory standards, then the regulator should have the discretion to 
investigate regardless of whether the subject of the relevant article wishes to take the matter 
further. In this context the issue is one of industry standards, not abuse of personal rights; 
but this is pertinent only to the extent that the regulator can issue some kind of adjudication, 
guidance or sanction that will inform subsequent behaviour, as well as seeking to provide 
redress to an individual who has suffered harm.

5.3 

The British and Irish Ombudsman Association has pointed out that for practical reasons there 
needs to be some limitation on who can bring a complaint. This has been echoed by others, 
who  fear  that  in  allowing  third  party  complaints,  and  in  particular  group  complaints,  the 
standards regime could be hijacked by groups wanting to fight political battles on the pretext 
of complaining about standards. In particular, ANL has argued:24 

“This  would  potentially  subvert  the  purpose  of  the  regulatory  system,  which  is  to 
protect the rights of those affected by the press and promote high standards. It is not 
to provide a means by which special interest groups can seek to impose their views 
on society at large by controlling what is written in the press about them and the 
interests they represent.”

5.8 

I am confident that, at some level, it must be possible within any effective new system for 
breaches of the relevant code to be drawn to the attention of the enforcement body by those 
affected by the breach, whether in the form of a direct personal reference or more indirectly. 
There is clearly room for debate as to precisely how this may be achieved and what sort of 
remedies or sanctions might be appropriate should a breach of standards be found. I do not 
believe that it is right to characterise the desire of groups to see agreed standards upheld as 
an attempt to “impose their views on society at large by controlling what is written in the press 
about them”.25 If a title has agreed to conform to certain standards then it is a reasonable 
expectation that they should do so without any group who maintains that those standards 
are not being upheld being accused of trying to interfere with freedom of expression. 

The  draft  Criteria  indicated  that  a  new  regime  must  have  effective  investigatory  and 
advisory  powers.  Inevitably,  there  will  be  disagreement  about  what  constitutes  ‘effective’ 
in this context, but overall this has proved particularly uncontentious in principle, with most 
proposals including investigatory powers of some sort. 

The draft Criteria also proposed that any new system should actively support and promote 
compliance with standards. Again, at a level of generality this has not proved to be a contentious 
issue, although quite who would be responsible for taking a proactive approach to promoting 
compliance varies from model to model. In this context, the draft Criteria suggested a few 
examples of ways in which active support and promotion of standards might happen. One 
of these was kitemarking; the provision of a kitemark is widely seen as an important part of 
any voluntary self-regulatory scheme. Some have suggested that the commercial value of a 
kitemark would be limited, but others believe that the public would want to buy a product 
that advertised its commitment to standards. 

The draft Criteria also mentioned the example, under this rubric, of providing confidential 
pre-publication advice to editors. This has proved somewhat controversial, but it was not the 
intention of the Inquiry by including this feature in the draft criteria to advance any specific 
proposal.  In  the  event,  proposals  have  been  submitted  to  the  Inquiry  under  which  some 
facet  of  a  new  regulatory  system  could  offer  confidential  advice  to  editors,  in  advance  of 
publication, on the merits of any public interest arguments that might later be relied on in 
actions relating to breach of privacy or breach of standards. Such advice would not be binding 
in any way, but the fact that advice had been sought (and either followed or ignored) could 
be taken into account in any subsequent enforcement action.26 

Concerns have been advanced about such proposals on the grounds that any intervention pre-
publication is a fundamental breach of freedom of expression.27 For example, ANL contend 
that “for a regulator to involve itself in pre-publication decisions is to trespass on the editor’s 
role”. 28  There  are  additional  questions  to  be  answered  about  who  the  appropriate  body 
would be to provide such advice, the relationship between that body and the enforcement 
body. Notwithstanding the concerns which have been expressed, for reasons which will be 
elaborated subsequently it remains my view that the provision of pre-publication advice to 
editors, on request, would be a useful service for a regulatory body to provide.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.9 

Finally under this heading, the draft Criteria indicated that the new regime would need to 
be  a  good  fit  with  other  relevant  regulatory  and  law  enforcement  functions.  This,  as  one 
might have expected, is completely uncontroversial at the level of principle, but may prove 
more difficult to implement in practice. There have been a number of concerns raised about 
the boundary between whatever new regime is proposed in this context and the existing 
broadcasting  regulation.  Some  suggestions  envisaged  bringing  together  all  media  under 
a  unitary  approach  to  regulation,  although  no-one  has  gone  as  far  as  suggesting  a  single 
regulator for all media. Others have expressed concern about the jurisdictional difficulties of 
regulating online content, and yet others about the boundary with the statutory requirements 
on online TV-like services imposed by the Audio Visual Media Services Directive. I share these 
concerns and consider that it will be important that the coverage of any new regime is clearly 
articulated and avoids any overlap between media regulators.29

5.10  The Inquiry has heard little about the need for any new standards system to fit within an overall 
effective  regime,  including  criminal  and  civil  law  enforcement,  although  that  is  obviously 
essential, indeed, some witnesses have suggested that effective criminal law enforcement 
would be a sufficient answer to the problems exposed by the Inquiry. I have set out earlier 
in the report why this is not, and never will be, a credible solution. I do not see any reason 
why, where standards and the criminal law overlap, there should not be an expectation that 
the regulator would continue to perform its core regulatory functions as it would in respect 
of any other standards.30

5.11  My  conclusion  is  that  Criteria  4  as  drafted  provides  a  satisfactory  set  of  requirements  in 
relation  to  powers  and  remedies,  subject  to  the  introduction  of  a  further  point  that  the 
regime  should  include  appropriate  and  proportionate  sanctions  for  systemic  or  egregious 
breaches of standards.

6.	 Cost
6.1 

The  draft  Criteria  stipulated  that  the  solution  must  be  sufficiently  reliably  financed  to 
allow  for  reasonable  operational  independence  and  appropriate  scope,  without  placing  a 
disproportionate burden either on the industry, complainants or the taxpayer. As drafted, it is 
difficult for anyone to disagree with that proposition and no-one has sought to do so. However, 
it is very difficult at this point to predict what the cost of any of the various approaches that 
have been put forward to the Inquiry might be. Lord Black estimates that his proposal would 
cost in the region of £2.25m31 but many editors, in particular from the regional press and 
magazines, have expressed concerns about the robustness of this estimate and whether the 
industry will be able to afford the attendant costs.32 Other proposals have suggested that

Chapter 1 | Criteria for a Regulatory SolutionK6.2 

6.3 

Government funding for part of a new regulatory regime might be reasonable, though it is 
worth noting that this is rejected by Lord Black as a matter of principle.33

Ofcom has argued that fixed term funding  settlements are necessary to provide the level 
of operational independence that any regulatory body would need.34 Any funding approach 
which  relied  on  year  by  year  agreement  of  the  regulator’s  budget  would  allow  too  much 
potential for the funding body to influence the approach to compliance and enforcement 
taken by the body. 

A  common  theme  running  through  these  proposals  is  that  it  should  be  free  for  persons 
aggrieved to bring complaints. Obvious questions have been raised about the risk of frivolous 
or vexatious complaints but, making due allowance for the fact that mechanisms can be put 
in place to deal with those issues, essentially this is another area on which the Inquiry has 
seen consensus. 

6.4  My conclusion is that Criteria 5 as drafted is an appropriate measure, albeit recognising that 
‘reliability’  of  funding  means  multi-year  settlements  to  protect  the  independence  of  the 
regulator from undue influence from those funding it.

7.	 Accountability
7.1 

Ofcom suggested that a further criteria for the accountability of the new regime should be 
added. Specifically, they contended that there should be an independent review of whatever 
new regime is put in place after three years. Arguably, this is of particular relevance in the 
context of the history of press self-regulation which demonstrates that historically it has been 
difficult to secure any lasting effective change.35 I agree that an independent review of any 
new regulatory regime would be an important benchmark in testing effectiveness.

The self regula Tory Model proposed 
by The pCC and pressbof

1.	
1.1 

Industry	acceptance	of	the	need	for	reform
In the early days of the Inquiry I made it clear that I was keen that the press industry should 
come forward with a credible proposal for the future regulation of standards across the press. 
I said that it was critical that the press should engage in the debate about how its regulation 
should move forward,1 that this was a problem for the industry and that the industry had 
to  solve  it.2  I  also  explained  that  it  was  important  that  a  solution  should  be  found  which 
worked both for the press and for the public and I looked to the press to come forward with 
proposals that would fit that brief; however, in the meantime I would continue looking for 
ways to improve the system.3 It is difficult to find an objective test for what ‘works for the 
public’. The public have three distinct roles here: first as readers of newspapers, second as 
citizens of a democratic country and third as the people about whom newspapers write. It is 
important that the interests of the public in all three roles are recognised and protected: the 
Prime Minister said that the test must be whether a solution works for the Dowlers and the 
McCanns.4

1.2 

It has been common ground that PCC does not offer a credible form of self-regulation and that 
significant change is needed. The current PCC Chair, Lord Hunt agreed that “tinkering around 
the edges” would not be sufficient and that this was an opportunity for the press to come 
forward with “the sort of system Sir David Calcutt was asking for.” 5 Lord Black, Chairman of 
the Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF), said he had never believed the PCC to be a 
regulator,6 and accepted that the PCC had failed:7

“The evidence submitted throughout the Inquiry into Press Standards has made clear 
that the Press Complaints Commission ultimately failed. While it had some significant 
achievements  to  its  name,  particularly  in  its  early  years,  it  proved  incapable  of 
dealing with the major ethical and cultural issues that have arisen in recent times. 
The scandal of phone hacking – and the PCC’s inadequate response to it – underlines 
that point. As a result, the existing system lost the confidence of Parliament, of the 
public and of the judiciary, all of whose support is essential if self regulation is to 
flourish. Crucially, the Commission also lost the support of parts of the newspaper and 
magazine publishing industry. The industry accepts the need for wholesale change, 
but within the framework of self regulation.”

K1.3 

In  recognition  both  of  the  failure  of  the  current  system  of  ‘self-regulation’  and  the  need 
for an industry generated proposal for the future, Lord Hunt developed a set of proposals 
which have been further developed by Lord Black, on behalf of the industry. A version of that 
proposal, representing the fruits of over 12 months work by the industry, has been submitted 
by Lord Black as “working documents in draft”.8 There has been a process of consultation with 
many parts of the industry, resulting in the following statement from the Newspaper Society, 
the Newspaper Publishers Association (NPA), the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society and the 
Professional Publishers Association:

“While a lot of detailed work is still to be done, the proposals have the broad support 
of the organisations and their members. The proposals are being further developed 
in the light of comments received as part of the ongoing consultation process. This 
process will take into account the deliberations and recommendations of the Leveson 
Inquiry and the Government responses to its findings.”

1.4 

It is important to recognise that publishers have not yet been asked to sign the contracts that 
underpin this proposal (so that at the time of publication of this report it remains open to 
doubt, if not considerable doubt, as to precisely what a final agreement might look like, or 
even whether such an agreement could be reached and which publishers would be willing 
to join). This Section of the Report looks at the proposal as it was submitted to the Inquiry.

2.	 The	proposal:	overview
2.1 

The proposal is based on a voluntary model described by Lord Black as “independently led 
self-regulation”. The key features are:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 
(d) 

(e) 

the creation of a new self-regulatory body, under an independent Trust Board, with 
greater independence from the industry than the PCC currently has and the power to 
impose fines for particularly serious or systemic failures;
a contractual relationship between the regulated body and each of the publishers to 
provide for medium term commitment to the system;
a continuation of the complaints handling role of the PCC;
the creation of a separate arm of the regulator with powers to investigate serious or 
systemic failures; and
the establishment of a new industry funding body to provide financial stability for the 
regulatory body.

2.2 

The proposal is set out in full in Lord Black’s submission,9 together with a draft contractual 
framework,10 draft Articles of Association of the new Regulator11 and draft Regulations12 that 
the members (or ‘regulated entities’) would have to comply with. Here I describe the key 
relevant features of the proposal in order to consider the extent to which it is capable of 
delivering the objectives set out earlier.13 They will be analysed later in the Report.14

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK3.	 Governance	and	structures
3.1 

Figure  K2.1  below  provides  a  pictorial  representation  of  the  composition  of  the  various 
bodies and how they relate to each other. The regulatory body itself is comprised of the Trust 
Board, which has overall responsibility for the self-regulatory regime, with subcommittees 
dealing with complaints and compliance and investigations respectively. Sitting outside the 
self-regulatory body are the Industry Funding Body (IFB), which is responsible for setting and 
delivering the funding for the regulatory body, and the Code Committee, which is responsible 
for agreeing the Code with which all regulated entities will have to comply.

The Independent Press Trust
The  Independent  Press  Trust  will  be  established  as  a  Community  Interest  Company.15  
The draft Articles of Association set out the objects of the Trust:16 

3.2 

“The objects of the Company are to carry on activities which benefit the community 
and  in  particular  to  promote  and  uphold  the  highest  professional  standards  of 
journalism in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, including 
by:

•  Establishing the Regulatory Scheme for regulating Regulated Entities;
•  Promoting compliance with the Editors’ Code of Practice;
•  Encouraging conciliation between Regulated Entities and complainants;
• 

Investigating and adjudicating on complaints from the public about Regulated 
Entities;

•  Publishing its findings; and 
• 

In accordance with the Regulatory Scheme, levying fines on Regulated Entities 
found to be in significant, systemic breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice, 
such fines to be proportionate to the nature and effect of the breach;

having regard at all times to the importance in a democratic society of freedom of 
expression and the public’s right to know.”

3.3 

The principle decision making body of the Trust would be the Trust Board17 with a Complaints 
Committee which would have primary responsibility for dealing with public complaints and 
an Investigations and Compliance Panel.18 Operationally the Trust would be run by a Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO), who would be appointed by the Board and report to them. There 
would also be a Head of Complaints, supporting the Complaints Committee, and a Head of 
Standards and Compliance, supporting the Compliance and Investigation Panel, who would 
each report to the CEO and ultimately to the Board.19, 20

The  Trust  will  be  able  to  cover  companies  in  the  UK,  the  Channel  Islands  and  the  Isle  of 
Man who are responsible for publishing printed newspaper or magazine titles in the UK, and 
their related websites, and web only publisher or news aggregators with content viewable in 
the UK.21 Membership will not necessarily be open to any company meeting those criteria.  
The Industry Funding Body would have:22 

“ultimate  discretion  to  refuse  membership  to  any  publishers  wishing  to  join  the 
scheme, even if such a publisher falls within the definition of a regulated entity.”

In his oral evidence Lord Black explained that this provision was in order to allow membership 
of the Trust to be refused to what he described as “top shelf publications” whose membership 
would be “wholly inappropriate” as the only complaints in relation to them were likely to be 
about taste and decency.23 

As drafted, this provision does not appear to place any restrictions on who could be refused 
membership by the IFB, or on the reasons for such a refusal. Neither does it allow the Press 
Trust itself any say in whether membership should be granted to an applicant. This could be an 
issue of particular concern if there were significant benefits to membership, or disadvantages 
attaching to non-membership. 

3.7 

In terms of content, the remit of the Trust covers editorial content in printed newspapers and 
magazines (but not books) and on websites and apps.24 The Trust would not cover broadcast 
content,  advertising,  taste  and  decency,  impartiality,  copyright  issues  or  employment

proceedings. The Trust will not cover non editorial content in newspapers or magazines, or 
content over which the publisher has not exercised editorial control.25

3.8 

The  functions  of  the  Trust  are  to  deal  with  complaints  and  mediation  and  to  deal  with 
standards and compliance.26 These are dealt with in more detail below.27 

3.9 

The Trust Board
It is proposed that the Trust Board will guarantee the independence of the new system. It 
will be responsible for the management of the company’s business, specifically supervising 
the governance of the company, managing its finances and audit, being responsible for the 
appointment of independent members, and liaising as necessary with the industry’s trade 
associations.28 The Trust Board has no role in the investigation of individual complaints from 
members  of  the  public.  By  contrast,  the  Trust  Board  has  to  trigger  any  investigation  into 
serious or systemic breach. The Trust Board is also responsible for establishing any appeal 
panel in relation to an investigation and for exercising the power of sanction in response to 
an investigation where that is appropriate.29

3.10  The ‘Regulator’, or in practice the Trust Board, will have responsibility for any changes to the 
Regulations, although any such changes must be approved by the IFB before they are made.30 

3.11  The Trust will not be responsible for the Editors’ Code of Practice31 but any changes to the 

Code will have to be ratified by the Trust Board before they come into effect.32

The Trust Board: membership and appointments 

3.12  The Trust Board is to comprise seven directors, four of whom (including the Chair) are to be 
independent, and three of whom are to be press directors.33 Members will serve a three year 
term, renewable once.34 No Trust Board member has more than one vote. The Chair has a 
second and casting vote in the case of a tied vote.35

3.13  The appointment of the Chair would be by a four person panel comprised of two industry 
members,  appointed  by  the  IFB,  and  two  lay  members,  entirely  independent  of  both  the 
industry and the Trust and appointed by the Trust Board.36 The panel would appoint a search 
consultant to draw up a shortlist for the post of the Chair. The panel would then interview the 
shortlisted candidates and make the appointment by unanimity.37

KChapter 2 | The Self Regulatory Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF3.14  The  three  other  independent  members  of  the  Trust  Board  are  to  be  appointed  through 
an  independent  appointments  process  determined  by  the  Trust  Board  itself.38  A  ‘shadow’ 
Trust Board will be set up by Lord Hunt to manage the first appointments process. Once the 
first permanent appointments have been made the Shadow Board will be disbanded.39 The 
submission does not say whether the panel to appoint the first Chairman will be appointed 
by the Shadow Board or the first permanent Board appointees. The three press members of 
the Trust Board will be appointed by the IFB and are expected to be individuals with senior 
editorial or publishing experience but not currently serving editors.40

Relationship between the Trust and publishers ‘regulated entities’

3.15  Publishers who join the Trust will be required to enter into a contract with the Trust which 

will require the publisher to:41

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 

comply with the Editors’ Code;
comply with the Regulations;
cooperate with any standards investigation;
abide by the Trust’s decisions; and 
commit to funding for the period of the contract.

3.16  The Regulations set out the remit and functions of the Trust, the procedures for handling 
and  mediation  of  complaints,  the  procedures  for  any  investigations,  the  powers  of  the 
Investigations and Compliance Panel, the powers of the Board to impose sanctions, including 
fines,  and  the  detail  of  the  annual  certification  process.42  All  this  is,  therefore,  contained 
within the contractual framework. The Regulations are the responsibility of the Trust, but can 
only be amended with the approval of the IFB.43 The contract will also set out the obligations 
of the Trust to deal fairly and proportionately with the contracting parties.44

3.17  The original contract will be for a minimum of five years from the inception of the system45 
and then continue on an annual rolling basis.46 Contracts will be between the publisher and 
the Trust and all contracts will be identical.47 The Trust has the right, as one of its powers of 
sanction,  to  terminate  the  contract  with  an  individual  publisher.48  An  individual  regulated 
entity has no power to terminate the contract.49 If a majority of contracting parties agree to 
terminate the contract then all contracts can be terminated on 12 months notice, although 
not before the expiry of the original five year term.50 The contracts can be varied by a majority 
of contracting parties, and where that is agreed the other contracting parties will be bound 
by the change.51 If a contract is terminated, the contracting party is still liable in respect of

regulated entity has an obligation to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the new 
owner enters into a contract with the Trust.53

3.18  A ‘majority’ for the purposes of contract variation and termination is yet to be defined.54 Lord 
Black explained that this would not be a simple majority of members, as that would mean 
the magazine sector would have the ability to outvote the rest of the members. Instead there 
would need to be a system of weighted votes that would give no sub sector the power of veto 
over changes and that would reflect the nature and diversity of the market.55

3.19  The regulated entities have no contractual liability towards each other.56 The Regulator has 
no liability for failure to exercise its powers and functions,57 and third parties have no rights 
under the contract,58 so victims of press abuse and those complaining about press behaviour 
have no enforceable rights under this system. It has been suggested that the Trust could be 
subject to judicial review and Lord Black said that the industry would be unlikely to contest 
the justiciability of the body if an action for judicial review were brought.59

4.	 Complaints
4.1 

There would be a Complaints Committee composed of 13 members: the Chair of the Trust, 
seven  independent  members,  and  five  serving  editors  (two  nationals,  one  Scottish,  one 
regional and one magazine). The independent members would be appointed by the Trust. 
The industry members are to be nominated by their trade associations.60 As with members of 
the Trust Board, members of the Complaints Committee would serve for a three year term, 
renewable once. 61

4.2 

Lord Black describes the proposed complaints handling regime as “building on the widely 
regarded  conciliation  techniques  of  the  PCC”.62  In  a  departure  from  current  practice  it  is 
proposed that wherever possible a complaint should  be handled directly by the editor of 
the publication concerned, and that only where a complaint cannot be resolved bilaterally 
should it become a matter for the regulator.63 Lord Black recognises that this would require 
the strengthening of internal compliance systems within publishers and argues that the new 
regulatory structure, including the annual compliance reports,64 would support this.65

4.6 

4.7 

The  Trust  will  consider  complaints  about  the  failure  of  a  regulated  entity  to  meet  the 
standards set out in the Editors’ Code. Complaints will be accepted from people who have 
been directly affected by the matters complained of. In addition, the Head of Complaints will 
have discretion to consider third party complaints where there has been a significant breach 
and there is substantial public interest in allowing the complaint to be brought.66 In his oral 
evidence Lord Black said that third party complaints on accuracy were currently accepted 
by the PCC, that that practice would continue under the proposed model and that the draft 
regulations were not intended to restrict that practice.67 

A complaint must be made within two months of the date of first publication of the article 
complained of, or within two months of the end of correspondence between the complainant 
and the publisher, as long as that correspondence was started straight after publication.68 
Where the disputed article is published online and remains online at the time of the complaint, 
the Head of Complaints may consider the complaint if the company declines to remove the 
article.69

The proposed process appears to mirror closely the existing PCC approach. Once a complaint 
has been accepted by the Head of Complaints, the Trust will write to the regulated entity with 
a copy of the complaint. The company must then respond and a copy of that response is sent 
to the complainant. Any response from the complainant then goes back to the company. If 
the complaint has not been resolved by that stage then the primary aim of the Trust is to find 
a mediated resolution. If mediation is successful then a summary of the outcome would be 
published on the Trust’s website. If mediation is not successful the complaint is passed to the 
Complaints Committee.70

The Complaints Committee must decide whether or not there has been a breach of the Code. 
If the Code has not been breached then the Committee will reject the complaint. If the Code 
has been breached then the Committee must take a view on whether sufficient remedial 
action has already been taken. If the Committee considers that the breach has been remedied 
then the Head of Complaints must decide whether it is appropriate for details of the outcome 
to be published on the Trust’s website, but no other action is taken. If the breach has not 
been remedied then the Committee will make a public ruling upholding the complaint. The 
company will be obliged to publish the critical ruling with due prominence.71

Due prominence is to be interpreted in line with the Code.72 The current PCC practice under 
the existing Code is that the prominence of publication of critical adjudications to be agreed 
between the PCC and the publisher. Lord Black explained that it would be for the Trust to 
negotiate any changes to the Code in this respect with the Code Committee.73 The proposal 
itself  does  not  give  the  Trust  any  powers  to  insist  on  the  location  or  prominence  of  the 
publication of an adjudication.

4.9 

The sanctions available to the Trust in relation to complaints may include informal resolution, 
published apologies, a formal reprimand and critical adjudication.74 The Trust will have no 
power to award compensation to a complainant.75 Neither will the Complaints Committee 
have any power to levy a fine. In the case of a particularly significant breach of the Code, the 
Trust may instigate an investigation which would then bring other sanctions into play.

The complainant will have the right, within 14 days of the original decision, to appeal the 
decision  to  an  Independent  Assessor.  The  Independent  Assessor  will  have  the  power  to 
confirm the decision of the Complaints Committee or refer it back to the Committee with a 
different decision.76 The publisher has no right of appeal against a decision of the Complaints 
Committee.77

4.10  The  Independent  Assessor  will  be  appointed  by  the  Trust  Board  for  a  three  year  term, 
renewable once. The Assessor must not be a member of the Complaints Committee and must 
not be connected with the industry.78

5.	 Standards	and	compliance
5.1 

As explained above,79 there will be a Head of Standards and Compliance, and it is proposed 
that  there  will  be  a  small  number  of  full  time  staff  within  the  Trust  who  would  service 
the  Investigation  and  Compliance  Panel.  The  Compliance  Panel,  however,  would  not  be  a 
permanent  body  but  would  be  created  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  when  required.80  Despite  this 
ad hoc existence, the Panel would have a number of ongoing core functions assigned to it 
according to Lord Black’s submission. These would include:81

(a) “overseeing  the  process  of  annual  certification  by  publishers  about  ethical 

and governance issues among their titles;

(b) monitoring and analysing the responses to that process and taking up issues 

that arise from them;

(c)  monitoring  trends  in  individual  complaints  dealt  with  by  the  Complaints 
Committee to detect issues of concern on individual titles or across individual 
publishers; and 

(d) analysing public or Parliamentary reports about press standards within specific 
areas to see if there is a substantive compliance issue highlighted by the that 
requires investigation.”

5.2 

In each of these areas the Panel is expected to make recommendations to the Trust Board if 
they feel that an investigation should be undertaken.82 If the Board agrees that an investigation

KChapter 2 | The Self Regulatory Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFis appropriate they will then appoint an Investigation Panel from within a pool of experts, 
drawing on appropriate experience and expertise.83 There is an obvious scheduling difficulty 
here, since the recommendation that an investigation be carried out has to be made by the 
Panel, but a Panel is not appointed until the Board has authorised an investigation. In practice 
it is likely that the core functions described above would sit with the Head of Investigation and 
Compliance and its small staff. It is not entirely clear whether this executive team would be 
overseen on an ongoing basis by a public member of the independent Trust Board, appointed 
by the Trust Board.84  85 

5.3 

Annual certification and compliance
Each  regulated  entity  will  have  to  submit  an  annual  statement  of  its  editorial  practices 
covering the following information:86

(a) 

(b) 
(c) 

concise factual information about the publisher, including the titles published and their 
circulation, and the name of the publisher’s compliance officer;
copies of relevant manuals, codes or guidance;
brief  details  on  compliance  processes,  including  how  the  publisher  deals  with  pre-
publication advice, verification of stories, compliance with the Editors’ Code, editorial 
complaints and the training of staff;

(d)  details of any incidents during the year involving a material breach of the Editors’ Code 

or the Regulations, and the measures taken in relation to such breaches; and

(e)  details of the steps taken in response to any adverse adjudications by the Trust during 

the year.

The requirement to compile and submit this annual statement is set out specifically in the 
draft contract framework, together with requirements on the regulated entities to use their 
best endeavour to ensure full cooperation with, and disclosure to, the Trust.87

5.4 

The  matter  of  whether  these  annual  statements  would  be  made  public  is  left  open.  Lord 
Black told the Inquiry that the assumption was that the document would be published, with 
only commercial or personal confidential information redacted.88 The draft Regulations leave 
publication of the annual reports to the discretion of the Trust.89

5.5  When the Trust receives the annual reports they would be reviewed by the Head of Standards 
and Compliance, who would raise any concerns directly with the company involved, before 
putting a report to the Trust which would identify any issues of concern or that require further 
investigation.90

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.6 

5.7 

Requirement for a named compliance officer
The draft contractual framework requires the appointment within each regulated entity of a 
senior individual who will take responsibility for ensuring that the regulated entity, and all its 
staff and subcontractors, comply with the contract.91 Lord Black describes this role as having 
responsibility for overseeing monitoring and compliance.92 

Investigations 
Both the structural aspects of the standards and investigations arm of the proposed Trust 
and the proactive compliance requirements placed on regulated entities are set out above.93 
The Trust also has its own proactive powers of investigation, over and above specific reactive 
response to complaints, where there is cause for concern. An investigation by the Trust may 
be triggered in the following circumstances:94

(a) 

“where it appears there have been significant systemic breaches of the Editors’ Code or 
in general of ethical behaviour;

(b)  where serious breaches of the criminal law have been found by the courts; or
(c)  where  annual  certification  identifies  significant  and  substantive  issues  of  concern  in 
relation  to  a  single  incident,  compliance  processes  or  a  long  term  pattern  of  code 
breaches.”

This list of circumstances in which an investigation may take place is not exhaustive.

Investigation process

5.8  Where  it  appears  to  the  Investigation  and  Compliance  Panel  (the  structural  difficulties  in 
this are noted above)95 that there is a need for an investigation into a particular publisher 
for one of the reasons above, they would make a report to the Trust Board, together with 
a recommendation for an investigation.96 The Trust Board can instigate an investigation in 
response to a recommendation from the head of Standards and Compliance or on its own 
initiative.97

5.9 

If the Board believes that a full investigation is required, it would decide the remit and terms of 
reference for an investigation. It would then write to the proposed subject of the investigation, 
setting out the remit and terms of reference, and explaining why an investigation was thought 
necessary. The Trust Board will then take any response from the regulated entity into account 
in reaching its decision on whether to instigate an investigation.98

5.10  Once  the  Trust  Board  has  decided  that  an  investigation  should  take  place  they  appoint  a 
member  of  the  Trust  Board  to  have  “day  to  day  oversight”  of  the  investigation,  which  is

KChapter 2 | The Self Regulatory Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFundertaken by the Head of Standards and Compliance.99 At the same time, the Trust Board 
must appoint an Investigation Panel. The Panel will comprise three people, two of whom will 
be public representatives with no connection to the press; and the third an individual with 
a senior newspaper or digital background, but not a serving editor.100 The Panel are all to be 
appointed from a pool of people with relevant expertise whose names will be published.101

5.11  The investigation would be carried out by the Head of Standards and Compliance, who must 
ensure  that  the  investigation  is  independent,  proportionate,  fair,  objective,  open-minded 
and  consistent.102  In  pursing  the  investigation  the  Head  of  Standards  and  Compliance  can 
request documents, answers to questions and access to key personnel. If the subject of the 
investigation refuses to provide the information required then the fact of the refusal, and the 
reasons for it, will be notified to the Investigation Panel.103 The Panel, however, have no role 
in resolving the situation. 

5.12 

If there is any dispute between the Head of Standards and Compliance and the subject of 
an investigation about the scope of an investigation, that dispute would be referred to the 
Trust Board. If the subject of the investigation continues to refuse to provide documents that 
the Head of Standards has properly requested then the Trust can take legal action under the 
contract for specific performance. A decision to bring legal proceedings to compel production 
of documents has to be approved by the Trust Board. There is no equivalent power to seek 
specific performance in relation to access to personnel.104

5.13  Once  the  Head  of  Standards  and  Compliance  has  completed  his  investigation  he  would 
prepare a report detailing the conclusions and any recommendations. That report would be 
provided to the subject of the investigation, who then would have 28 days to provide written 
submissions  to  the  Investigation  Panel.  The  Investigation  Panel  would  meet  to  consider 
the report from the Head of Standards and Compliance, together with any representations 
received from the subjects of the investigation. 

5.14  At that meeting the Investigation Panel would “in most cases” hear a presentation on the 
report from the Head of Standards and Compliance. It is not clear in what circumstances a 
presentation from the Head of Standards and Compliance would not be appropriate. In all 
cases  the  Panel  will  invite  representatives  from  the  subject  of  the  investigation  to  attend 
the meeting, where they will be entitled to make representations and they could be asked 
questions by the Panel. The representatives of the subject of the investigation would leave 
the meeting when the Panel discusses and reaches its decision.105

5.15  At the meeting the Panel can request further work to be done, or it can reach a preliminary 

conclusion. The conclusions open to the Panel are:106

(a) 
(b) 

that there is no evidence of any, or of significant, wrongdoing;
to  make  non-binding  recommendations  about  best  practice,  whether  directed

specifically at the subject of the investigation or at the industry more generally;
to reprimand the subject of the investigation; 
to refer a systemic failure to the Trust Board to consider a fine;
to direct the publication, by the subject of the investigation, of a summary of the Panel’s 
finding. The wording and prominence of that publication are to be agreed between the 
regulated entity and the Trust Board;
to refer the matter to the Trust Board to consider a cost contribution; or
to  require  undertakings  from  the  subject  of  the  investigation  in  respect  of  future 
conduct.

Further consideration of these sanctions is made below.107

5.16  The decision of the Panel must be sent in draft to the subject of the investigation, who has 14 
days to make comments on the draft, including correcting mistakes or arguing that anything 
has been misunderstood or that incorrect conclusions have been reached. Having received 
those representations the Panel will then reach a final decision.108 

5.17  The subject of the investigation can ask for a review of that decision by writing to the Trust 
Board within 14 days of receiving the decision of the Panel. A review can be sought on the 
grounds  that  either  the  process  or  the  decision  were  fundamentally  flawed.109  The  Trust 
Board will consider the evidence, including any new evidence submitted to it, and decide 
whether to accept the review request. If the Trust Board accepts the review request then 
they will establish a Review Panel.110 The composition of a Review Panel is exactly the same 
as that of an Investigation Panel but must not contain any of the members of the original 
investigations panel.111

5.18  The Review Panel would consider all the information provided to the Investigation Panel and, 
at their discretion, any new evidence provided. The draft decision of the Review Panel would 
be sent to the subject of the investigation who will have 14 days to make representations 
including,  as  at  the  earlier  stage,  to  correct  any  mistakes,  argue  that  anything  has  been 
misunderstood or that the wrong conclusions have been reached.112

5.19  The Review Panel would consider any representations made by the subject of the investigation 
and then reach a final conclusion, against which there is no further right of appeal.113 There 
is no role in this process for anyone who has been the victim of any of the behaviour under 
investigation.  Complainants have no power to submit  evidence or to provide submissions 
on the decisions.114 Complainants will generally not be aware of an investigation until a final 
decision is published.

5.20  The decision of the Investigation Panel, or, if there is a review, the decision of the Review 

Panel, and the reasons for it, would normally be published.115

KChapter 2 | The Self Regulatory Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFSanctions

5.21  The range of sanctions available to the Trust starts with a ‘reprimand’ about which no further 
information is provided. It is not clear how a reprimand would be issued, or whether it would 
be published, although publication of a summary of the Panel’s findings is also an available 
sanction. The Trust can also require, and monitor, undertakings in respect of future conduct.

5.22 

If the Investigation Panel (or the Review Panel) concludes that there has been a systemic 
failure  the  Trust  Board  has  the  power  to  levy  fine  on  the  relevant  regulated  entity.116  A 
‘systemic failure’ is one: 117

“where  it  appears  there  has  been  one  or  more  significant  or  serial  or  widespread 
breach  or  breaches  of  the  Editors’  Code  or  of  ethical  standards  which  indicate  a 
systemic or serious failure at one or more Regulated Entity”.

5.23  The Trust Board would decide the level of the fine. The criteria to be followed by the Trust 
Board in determining the level of fines is to be set out in the Financial Sanctions Guidelines. 
The Financial Sanctions Guidelines are to be issued by the IFB.118 A draft of those guidelines 
has  been  provided  and  would  allow  the  Trust  Board  to  impose  a  fine  of  up  to  1%  of  the 
turnover  related  to  the  publication  found  to  have  committed  a  systematic  failure  up  to  a 
maximum of £1,000,000.119 

5.24 

In setting the level of any fine the Trust Board has to take account of the following factors:120

the nature of the regulated entity;
the nature of the systemic failure and its impact;

(a) 
(b) 
(c)  whether the systemic failure was inadvertent or deliberate or reckless;
(d) 

any aggravating or mitigating factors (including whether the regulated entity brought 
the failure to the attention of the Trust, cooperation with the investigation, whether the 
management were aware of the failure and what steps, if any, they took to prevent it, 
and the previous record of the publisher);
any adjustments for deterrence; and 
any discounts for early settlement.

(e) 
(f) 

5.25  Finally, it is open to the Trust Board to require the regulated entity to make a contribution to 
costs. The Regulations indicate that there will be separate guidance on how the Trust Board 
should determine a cost contribution, but this is not covered in the material provided to the 
Inquiry.121

6.	 Potential	for	growth
6.1 

The  proposal  allows  for  the  addition  of  an  arbitral  arm to  deal  with  matters  of  libel  and/
or privacy issues. Lord Black states that a proposal along these lines has not been included 
in the submission to the Inquiry because the nature of any such arbitral system would be 
dependent on changes to the law, including the Defamation Bill currently before Parliament.

1608

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKThe Inquiry is told that the industry is keen to pursue this option and is satisfied that the 
proposal submitted is sufficiently flexible to allow for such a development.122

7.	 Funding
7.1 

The  proposed  system  would  be  fully  funded  by  the  industry  through  the  payment  of 
membership fees to the Trust. The funding arrangements for the standards and compliance 
part of the structure are slightly different, and are explained below, but again the process is 
fully funded by the industry. Lord Black, on behalf of the industry, has said that it would be 
inappropriate for the taxpayer to make any contribution towards a system of self-regulation. 
Similarly, it would be wrong to require complainants to pay any charge in relation to complaints. 
The fully funded self-regulatory proposal is submitted to the Inquiry as a sign of the industry’s 
commitment to protecting the public and putting right things which have gone wrong.123 124

7.2 

7.3 

The funding for the Trust will be guaranteed as part of the contract. Publishers will commit 
to making payments for the duration of the contract.125 The core cost (excluding compliance 
and standards work to be funded separately) is estimated to be around £2.25 million per 
annum.126  The  fees  payable  by  each  publisher  will  be  calculated  according  to  an  “agreed 
formula”.127 That formula is to be set by the IFB and can be changed at their discretion.128 
Lord Black has told the Inquiry that it is:129

“impossible  to  predict  how  [the  costs  of  the  new  system]  might  be  fairly  and 
proportionately divided within the industry.”

At  a  subsectoral  level,  the  shares  of  the  cost  of  the  PCC  are  generally  54%  for  national 
newspapers,  39%  for  Scottish  and  regional  newspapers,  and  7%  for  magazines.  These 
proportions  have  changed  for  the  2012  financial  year,  with  national  newspapers  taking  a 
59.1% share, Scottish and regional newspapers a 34.4% share and magazines a 6.5% share.130 
The current distribution of costs for the PCC between national newspapers has never been 
disclosed on a publisher by publisher basis as they are considered to contain commercially 
confidential information.131 The Inquiry has been told that the national newspaper publishers 
are currently looking at the funding formulae to see how they could better reflect the realities 
of new business models.132 Lord Black expressed the hope that whatever funding formula 
emerges from this process it might be possible to be more transparent about precisely who 
was paying what.133

KChapter 2 | The Self Regulatory Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF7.4 

7.5 

7.6 

The IFB will publish the list of publishers who have signed a contract with the regulator and 
an annual record of the proportions of funding met by different parts of the industry.134 

The IFB has the responsibility both to set the formula and to collect the membership fees 
from the publishers. There is no mechanism set down for the IFB to agree the overall level 
of funding with the Trust Board. Lord Black explained that the core costs are expected to be 
reasonably predictable at £2.25m,135 that these were significant sums for the industry in the 
current commercial climate,136 but that he had no doubt that sufficient funding would be 
made available to allow the regulator to fulfil its function.137

The standards and compliance costs are more difficult to predict and consequently will be 
subject to a different funding approach.138 The Trust will be established with a ring-fenced 
enforcement fund of £100,000 to cover the costs of the Investigations and Compliance Panel. 
It  is  anticipated  that,  over  time,  the  costs  of  the  compliance  arm  will  be  met  from  fines 
levied on publishers found responsible for wrong doing. Once the enforcement fund reaches 
£500,000 the original £100,000 contribution will be repaid to its initial contributors.139

8.	 The	Code	and	the	Code	Committee
8.1 

The whole proposal relies on the existence of the Editors’ Code as the statement of standards 
to which publishers commit when entering into a contract with the Trust. The Editors’ Code 
is currently owned by the Code Committee, which is comprised of 13 serving editors, drawn 
from across the industry.140 Under the proposal, that structure would remain in place, but 
there would be five additional members: the Chair and the Chief Executive of the Trust, and 
three further public members appointed by the Trust Board. The Chair of the Code Committee 
would be elected by the members of the Committee from among the editorial members.141

8.2 

Under  the  draft  contractual  structure  the  Code  is  the  responsibility  of  the  IFB,  although 
the relationship between the Code Committee and the IFB is not spelled out in detail. Any

sets out the totality of the IFB’s role in relation to the proposed self-regulatory regime.

Lord Black said:144

“In  any  self-regulator  regime  there  will  always  be  a  need  for  the  industry  to  be 
involved in some way. In this case, the publishing industry’s chief involvement will 
be  through  the  operation  of  the  Code  Committee  [….]  and  some  form  of  industry

The IFB is obviously responsible for setting and collecting the membership fees. The IFB would 
set both the overall level of funding to be provided to the Trust and the distribution of that 
funding between the regulated entities.145 

The IFB has the power to enforce the contract between a publisher and the Trust in respect 
of the payment of the membership fee.146

The IFB is responsible for the Editors’ Code. Any changes to the Code will have to be approved 
by the Trust Board.147 

The IFB is responsible for appointing the two industry members of the appointment panel 
that appoints the Chair of the Trust.148 

The IFB must approve any changes to the Regulations.149 

The IFB is responsible for the Sanctions Guidance which will be used in setting the level of any 
fine as a result of an investigation.150 

10.	 Incentives	to	membership
10.1 

It is recognised by the industry that it is important to have incentives for publishers to join the 
proposed system. Four such incentives are outlined in the proposal submitted to the Inquiry 
by Lord Black. These are:

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 

the provision of press cards;
the use of agency copy through the Press Association;
a “kitemark” for publications which are part of the system; and
the way in which advertisers can support the system.

KChapter 2 | The Self Regulatory Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFPress cards

10.2  Press cards are currently issued under the banner of the UK Press Card Authority (UKPCA) 
by 17 gatekeepers ranging from the NPA to the National Union of Journalists. At present the 
press card simply confirms the identity of the holder and the fact that they meet the criteria 
of their gatekeeper, which loosely means that they are engaged in journalistic work.151

10.3  Lord Black told the Inquiry that under the proposal the issuing of press cards would be limited 
to journalists working for publications who were signed up to the self-regulatory regime, or 
other organisations such as a relevant industry body or a trade union.152 The basis on which 
bodies were accepted as ‘relevant’ in this context has not been set out in any detail. 

10.4 

In addition to a limitation on who could be issued with press cards, the proposal is that the 
courts, Parliament, local councils, police, and sports and entertainment bodies would agree 
only to deal with journalists accredited with the new press cards.153 The Inquiry has seen no 
evidence of any discussions between the industry and these bodies on the proposal, nor has 
any evidence been taken from those bodies as to their willingness to participate in such an 
approach.

Access to agency copy

10.5  Paul Dacre, editor in chief of Associated Newspapers told the Inquiry that the newspaper 
industry  owns  the  Press  Association  (PA)  and  that  there  are  “significant  steps  afoot”  to 
examine how the service could be denied to publishers who were not members of the new 
self-regulatory system.154 This proposal was described by Lord Black as “legally challenging”, 
particularly  because  of  the  competition  issues  raised;  these  are  dealt  with  later  in  this 
Report155 and will be the subject of a report to the PA Board by September 2012.156

Kitemark

10.6  The provision of a kitemark as a badge of quality would be a matter for the Trust itself. Mr 
Dacre suggested that such a mark could be carried alongside corrections and clarifications 
columns to tell the public how to make a complaint and provide information on the process.157 
Lord Hunt said that those who join the new regime should carry its badge with pride.158 

Support from advertisers

10.7  No detailed proposal in relation to what support advertisers could give to the self-regulatory 
system has been provided. Mr Dacre suggested that advertisers, in particular Government 
and public sector bodies, might be persuaded not to advertise in newspapers which were

been held with any bodies which might be able to deliver a proposal in this regard and I 
cannot think of any commercial reason why advertisers would wish to go down this route, 
which could threaten to deprive them of access to one route to what might be a significant 
market.

KChapter 2 | The Self Regulatory Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFChapter 3 
analysis of the Model proposed by 
the pCC and pressbof

1.	
1.1 

Introduction
The last Chapter set out the key features of the model presented by Lord Black on behalf of 
PressBof and the industry. This Chapter analyses that proposal, in particular in relation to the 
criteria set out in Chapter 1 above.

2.	 Effectiveness

2.1 

2.2 

2.3 

The model must be perceived as credible by the industry
In the criteria for a new effective regulatory regime I said that a new model must be perceived 
as credible by the industry. One aspect of that credibility is the willingness of the industry to 
participate in it. It was recognised by Lord Hunt that a new system would not be perceived to 
be effective if a ‘big fish’ were not a part of it, accepting that Northern and Shell qualified as 
a ‘big fish’ for these purposes.1 He went further:2

“Q. ... of course if they don’t sign up and the devil is in the detail, then immediately 
the  credibility  of  the  new  system  would  have  been  fatally  undermined.  That  must 
follow, mustn’t it?
A. Yes.”

Lord Black also accepts this by implication when he identifies the withdrawal of Northern and 
Shell from the PCC as evidence of a “significant structural problem” within the existing system.3 
My own strong view is that no system of press standards regulation could be considered to 
be credible if one or more national newspaper publisher were not covered by it in some way, 
without any consequences as a result.

So, does the model proposed by Lord Black meet that test? The proposal was submitted to the 
Inquiry by Lord Black in his capacity as Chairman of PressBoF, which is the co-ordinating body for 
the newspaper and magazine publishing industry’s trade associations. Those trade associations 
said:4

“While a lot of detailed work is still to be done, the proposals have the broad support 
of the organisations and their members. The proposals are being further developed in 
the light of comments received as part of the ongoing consultation process.”

1614

K2.4  Whilst this model has been offered to the Inquiry by the industry as a whole, some national 
publishers argued for ‘even tougher’ controls.5 Lord Black explained that that editors at The 
Independent, The financial Times and the Guardian had wanted to look at the whether some 
form of statutory underpinning might be necessary.6

2.5 

2.6 

2.7 

2.8 

2.9 

These proposals have been the subject of three consultation processes, first on the broad 
architecture, then on an initial draft contract and set of regulations, and finally on a revised 
set of those documents together with draft articles of association for the new company. The 
proposal submitted to the Inquiry is the result of that extended consultation process.7 The 
consultations were primarily conducted through the trade associations, but the documents 
were also made available to those in the industry who are not members of any association.8

Industry readiness
Despite this extensive consultation process within the industry, it is clear that the proposals 
have not been developed to a stage where many, if any, publishers are yet willing to sign a 
contract with the new regulator. Section 6 below looks in detail at the evidence the Inquiry 
has had from the editors of national and regional newspapers, magazines and blogs about 
their views of Lord Black’s proposal and the extent to which they are now ready and willing 
to sign up to it. In summary, however, there are a handful of national newspapers which are 
signalling a clear willingness to join, almost irrespective of the final detail of the contract. A 
substantial number of other national titles have indicated willingness, in principle, to join 
but have indicated concerns on matters of detail and, in some cases, principle as well. Those 
national titles belonging to the Northern and Shell Group have indicated significant concerns 
about the proposals and reservations about joining the system. 

Among both magazines and local and regional newspapers there is broad support for the 
principles that underpin the proposals, coupled with a natural caution about committing to 
a contract where the details remain to be settled. A number of the editors who have given 
evidence have identified issues with the proposals that remain to be addressed, and which 
would prevent them from signing up to the proposal as currently drafted. None identified any 
points of principle that would prevent them joining at all if the proposal could be amended 
to meet their concerns. 

The editors of blogs who have provided evidence to the Inquiry largely felt that the proposal 
was irrelevant to them and offered them nothing. 

It is clear from this that Lord Black’s proposals enjoy wide support throughout the newspaper 
publishing  industry,  and  that  magazine  publishers  are  also  generally  sympathetic  to  the 
approach. However, the nature of the views expressed is evidence of the process by which 
the proposals have been developed, with the national press at the heart of the structure. The 
fact that a number of major national newspaper publishers are willing to tell the Inquiry that 
they are committed to signing up to the proposed scheme is undoubtedly a positive sign. 
However, the fact that some of the national publishers are still expressing doubts on points of 
detail means that there must be doubt about the ability of PressBoF to secure the agreement 
even  of  these  publishers  to  the  model  as  presented.  Further,  the  significant  concerns  on 
points of principle expressed by editors from the Northern and Shell group publications must 
indicate doubt about the likelihood of Northern and Shell ultimately deciding in favour of 
membership of the proposed body.

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF2.10  Under these circumstances, whilst it is clearly possible that all national newspapers would 
be prepared to join a system along the lines proposed, I cannot conclude with any certainty 
that the system proposed by Lord Black would have any greater coverage among the national 
press than the PCC currently does. This must be regarded as a significant flaw, albeit one that 
could be remedied by all major national newspapers signing a contract for membership of 
the new system. 

2.11  A new regulatory system must work for the whole press and the emerging digital market, not 
just for the national press. The local and regional press, with some magazines and online news 
providers, have identified a number of concerns about the compliance burdens, the cost, the 
ability of that part of the press to influence the system and the ability of the regulator to 
vary the contract without the support of all members. These are real concerns and I would 
anticipate that the publishers will want to see real answers to them before agreeing to sign 
up to the system. It might, for example, be sufficient to re-balance the burden of the costs 
between local and national publishers but, without detail, it is impossible to say. It would 
obviously be important from a credibility perspective that resolving these concerns should 
not significantly weaken the independence or regulatory power of the body proposed.

Incentives to join

2.12  Lord Black sets out four potential incentives that could be developed to encourage membership 
of the system. The first would be to limit the provision of press cards to journalists who work 
for an organisation that had signed up to an ethical code.

2.13  The Inquiry has been provided with a copy of a proposal which was considered by the UK 
Press Card Association (UKPCA).9 The proposal would involve two changes to the process by 
which press cards are currently issued. First, the cardholder would have to make a declaration 
that they would abide by an appropriate ethical code. Second, there would be a requirement 
for the ethical compliance of the cardholder’s employer or, if he or she was freelance, his or 
her main client, professional association or trade union.10

2.14  The  proposal  would  not  include  any  change  in  the  process  by  which  foreign  journalists 
are able to be issued with press cards.11 The UKPCA note that, in respect of broadcasters 
and newspaper and magazine publishers who are members of the industry self-regulatory 
body, there would effectively be no change to the current system. Broadcasters are already 
regulated by Ofcom and the UKPCA would accept membership of the new self-regulatory 
body as sufficient evidence of ethical compliance.12

2.15  The UKPCA notes that press agencies and picture agencies would need to become ethically 
regulated  by  subscribing  to  an  appropriate  code.  The  Press  Association  (PA)  is  currently 
subject  to  the  PCC  code.13  There  would  also  be  significant  changes  for  individuals  who 
operate on a freelance basis and for those organisations, such as professional organisations 
and trade unions, who act as press card gate keepers for them. In these circumstances the 
UKPCA would expect the gate keeper organisation to have or subscribe to an appropriate 
ethical code. It is noted that the NUJ already has its own code. In addition, these gatekeepers 
would have to certify that, where they were issuing a card to a journalist who is an employee,

1616

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKthat the employer is itself signed up to appropriate ethical regulation. In other words, a union 
could “not issue a UK press card to an employee of a newspaper not signed up to the PCC’s 
successor”.14 

2.16 

In the case of unaffiliated freelancers (those who are not members of a professional association 
or a trade union who acts as a gate keeper for the UKPCA) a UKPCA subcommittee would be 
established to consider eligibility; those found to be eligible by the subcommittee would be 
helped to find a gatekeeper.15

2.17  Some significant questions remain unanswered by the proposal. Specifically it is recognised 
that  the  scheme  would  need  to  deal  with  questions  of  eligibility,  complaints,  misuse, 
misbehaviour and breaches of ethical codes. The UKPCA proposal says that withdrawal of a 
card should only be by decision of the gatekeepers’ committee.16

2.18  This proposal was considered by the UK Press Card Association on 10 July 2012 but did not 
achieve the 75% majority required for a rule change. The UKPCA has no plans to revisit this 
issue.17 Mike Gannatt, the Chair of the UKPCA, gave it as his opinion that this was due not to 
any objection in principle to incorporating an ethical dimension to accreditation, but to the 
attempt to link that with a regulatory regime:18

“The kitemark proposal foundered over its additional intention to coerce compliance 
with self-regulation. This created insurmountable conflicts of opinion and interest.”

2.19  Despite  the  UKPCA  decision,  it  is  worth  considering  the  merits  and  disadvantages  of  the 
proposal in case it should be raised again. A number of witnesses to the Inquiry have raised 
substantive  concerns  about  it.  Harriet  Harman  QC  MP  pointed  out  that  the  risk  with  this 
proposal that citizens and bloggers could be excluded from access to public information. The 
many private organisations, such as sports clubs, who hold press conferences might not want 
to be a part of such a proposal. The more significant risk was that individual journalists might 
lose their accreditation when a wider culture within a publication was to blame. Essentially, 
she said, this proposal was akin to licensing and could inhibit a free press.19

2.20  Angela Philips echoed all of these concerns, saying that it would, in effect let the tabloid press 
decide who was going to be allowed to be a journalist.20 There would be no way to protect 
a journalist who fell out with management at his or her newspaper who could then simply 
revoke his or her press card.21 Similarly, Ofcom noted that there would be some definitional 
difficulties  in  defining  a  journalist  in  a  digital  environment  and  that  such  a  system  could 
potentially have a restrictive effect on rights of freedom of expression.22 The Media Standards 
Trust regarded the proposal as:23

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF“flawed; it is outdated in an age of digital media; discriminatory against the individual 
blogger  or  concerned  citizen;  most  likely  at  odds  with  the  commercial  interests  of 
many of the organisations it seeks to engage with; and perilously close to a licensing 
of journalism by non-state means.”

2.21  By contrast, the Media Regulation Roundtable24 and Professor Roy Greenslade25 noted the 
proposal was a worthwhile potential benefit to being a member of a self-regulatory system.

2.22 

I share the concerns of those who liken this proposal to the licensing of journalists. It seems 
to me that the risk of this working in a way which is damaging to competition and freedom 
of speech is high. It also seems to me that it puts individual journalists very much at risk 
of being expected to take the consequences of ethical breaches that they may have been 
pressured into by the culture or practice operating inside the newsroom in which they were 
working. In addition to those concerns, I am not convinced that those who want to get their 
message across to the media will see any benefit in cooperating with this proposal, so its 
effectiveness as an incentive to membership of a self-regulatory regime may well be limited. 
I do not regard this as either a sufficient, or a desirable, approach to encouraging publishers 
into a self-regulatory standards regime. 

2.23  The second incentive proposed is that the Press Association was looking to see whether it 
could provide an incentive to membership of the self-regulatory body by varying the terms 
on which it supplies services to non-members.26 A proposal of this sort would undoubtedly 
raise serious questions about compatibility with competition law. PressBoF has helpfully set 
out the arguments that support the theory that such an arrangement could be considered.27 
Even if it were to be in breach of s2 of the Competition Act 1998, such an arrangement might 
be allowed if it were inherent to the regulatory proposal or if it could be objectively justified 
as being in the public interest in raising the professional and ethical standards of the press. 
It is not possible to take a view on whether a proposal of this sort would, in fact, meet any 
of those tests without seeing the detail of the proposal. Even if it were to meet those tests it 
would also have to be proportionate and the least restrictive method of achieving the desired 
outcome: I am not at all satisfied that this would be the case.

2.24  The  impact  of  this  proposal  would  also  depend  heavily  on  what  was  involved.  There  is  a 
substantial  difference,  for  example,  between  refusing  to  supply  publishers  with  copy  or 
supplying them on different terms and conditions. In any case, other press agencies exist and 
it is possible that a publisher outside the system may be able to replace PA services. 

2.25  The third incentive proposed is access for members to a kitemark to signify quality, and the 
fourth is an entirely undefined suggestion that the advertising industry might be able to help. 
I look at these ideas in a little more detail later on, but essentially there is little to suggest that 
either would be particularly effective as incentives.28

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK2.26 

I cannot escape the conclusion that this package of incentives, particularly given the position 
now reached by the UKPCA, does not constitute a compelling argument for any publisher to 
join the body if they were otherwise not inclined to do so. I am very keen to find incentives 
to  persuade  publishers  into  independent  voluntary  regulation  and  I  find  it  somewhat 
disappointing that the industry, with their own knowledge of what is important to them, have 
not managed to come up with a more compelling package than this.

Contract issues

Contract term

2.27  Membership  of  the  system  would  be  by  a  five  year  rolling  contract.  The  contract  would 
require members to pay the agreed levy for the duration of the contract and would bind 
members to comply with the provisions of the contract, including compliance with the code 
and co-operation with investigations, even if they were otherwise to leave the system during 
the  term  of  the  contract.29  Should  such  a  five  year  contact  be  signed,  it  would  provide  a 
reasonable degree of certainty for the system for five years. However, there is no certainty 
over what might happen next. Lord Black suggested two possibilities:30

“It could work on a 12-month rolling cycle after the five-year term has ended. There 
is another possibility, that the five-year break term could be used to review the terms 
of  the  contract  and  publishers,  if  they  agree,  could  then  enter  another  five-year 
contract.”

2.28  The continuation of the system proposed by Lord Black beyond the initial five year period 
would be entirely dependent on the willingness of the industry to enter into a further contract. 
Furthermore, it is entirely possible that at that point the majority might decide to create a 
much less robust system. Lord Black told the Inquiry that he could not see circumstances in 
which that would happen. Instead, it would be an opportunity for consideration of how well 
the system worked and any improvements that could be made.31 He said:32

“So it’s a break-point that should work, I think, in both ways.”

2.29 

In practice, this must represent a very real risk to the sustainability of the proposed model 
beyond the first five year term. I recognise that no system of regulation could be expected, 
or wished, to last for ever, but this degree of built in failure seems problematic. Nor is it clear 
to me how this could be remedied. I entirely accept that it is not possible to bind people to a 
contract in perpetuity, in which case this would appear to be a fundamental problem with a 
system which is held together only by contract.

Transfer of title

2.30  Should  a  member  wish  to  transfer  a  title  to  a  non-member  they  are  required  to  use  “all 
reasonable  endeavours”  to  ensure  that  the  new  owner  is  a  member  of  the  regulatory 
scheme.33 This stops short of the more obvious requirement that a title may not be transferred

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFunless the new owner signs a contract with the scheme. Lord Black explained that the looser 
formulation was intended to protect the position of proprietors of local newspapers, where 
a degree of consolidation in the market is expected and proprietors are reluctant to have 
their hands tied in the matter of potential purchasers. However, Lord Black pointed out that 
most transfers of titles were likely to be between publishers who were already members of 
the system so the issue would not arise often.34 I recognise the concern expressed in relation 
to the economic difficulties faced in particular by local newspapers. However, this is a rather 
obvious weak link in the argument that the contract binds newspapers into the system. 

Contract variation

2.31  The structure of the system is that all publishers would enter into a bilateral contract with 
the regulator. Those contracts would all be identical. The contract could be varied where a 
majority agrees to variation. The precise mechanism for this is not set out in the proposal put 
to the Inquiry. Lord Black explained that the majority would have to be calculated on the basis 
of weighted votes:35

“If it wasn’t weighted votes, you could have a situation in which, because they are 
much  greater  in  number,  the  magazine  publishers  could  change  the  contract  by 
outvoting  everybody  else.  So  we  need  to  have  (sic)  find  some  way  of  doing  that 
which gives no group of regulated entities a power of veto over changes, but that the 
voting procedure reflects the nature and diversity of the market. I can’t pretend we’ve 
cracked that one.”

This is a potentially significant issue. Some in the industry have raised their unease about 
being subject to a contract which could be varied without their agreement. Clearly the exact 
nature of the weighting will be an important issue for all in the industry and may be difficult 
to resolve. Should it not be possible to reach agreement on a method of varying the contract 
by majority, the only alternative would be for any change to require unanimity; this would 
make changes extremely difficult to achieve.

Enforcement 

2.32  As  further  explained  in  paragraphs  5.23-5.35  below,  the  contract  model  is  designed  to 
introduce  a  measure  of  internal  enforceability.  I  underline  ‘internal’,  because  it  is  of  the 
essence  of  the  contractual  arrangement  that  it  is  not  intended  to  be  enforceable  at  the 
suit  of  a  third  party  –  a  reader,  say,  or  member  of  the  public.  It  relies  in  other  words  on 
a credible prospect of (expensive and uncertain) litigation proceedings between the press 
organisations  themselves  to  enforce  the  contract  against  each  other.  There  must  be  real 
questions about that credibility in real life. The likely motivations of press organisations to 
contemplate suing each other to retain commitment to the contract are very far from clear. 
In any event, classically, contractual disputes tend to be settled commercially by the payment 
of compensation rather than the specific enforcement of the terms of a contract. Even within 
the terms of the contract, there is at the very least an area of doubt and complexity about the 
extent to which financial penalties could be enforced in a contract action.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKThe model must be perceived as credible by the public

2.33  Any  new  model  must  also  be  perceived  as  credible  by  the  public.  The  industry  has  not 
attempted to conduct any consultation with the public on the proposals put forward or taken 
any steps to understand public expectations of press standards. Lord Black told the Inquiry 
that this was due to a lack of opportunity to do so but suggested that newspapers would be 
uniquely well placed to “take the temperature of the public” on the proposals if that was felt 
to be helpful.36 Similarly, Lord Hunt said:37

“One thing which I had been contemplating is that at some stage we ought to have 
a public consultation, but I felt that to do anything in that direction would be wrong 
pending the result of this Inquiry.”

2.34 

I find it extraordinary that, given the acceptance by Lord Black and the newspaper industry 
that the current system of press regulation has lost public confidence, they did not regard 
public  views  on  the  matter  as  of  sufficient  interest  or  importance  to  make  any  effort  to 
ascertain them. I find it more extraordinary that, having had its attention drawn to this point 
by the Inquiry, there is still no sign of the industry making any effort to understand public 
expectations in relation to press standards. This lack of interest in the views of the public may 
be symptomatic of the approach that the press has consistently taken towards regulation 
over many decades. It demonstrates the extent to which the press continue to prioritise their 
own interests, with consideration of the wider public interest only in as much as it applies to 
the importance of protecting the freedom of the press, and only then to the extent that they 
can appoint themselves the arbiter of it. 

2.35  The Inquiry placed Lord Black’s proposal on the Inquiry website and sought comments from 
interested parties and the general public. For the most part the responses have been from 
those already engaged with the Inquiry.

2.36  A submission on behalf of the Core Participant Victims said:38

“The Module 4 CPVs have considered the submissions and evidence of Lord Hunt and 
Lord Black. The Module 4 CPVs all agree that the proposal advocated by Lord Hunt and 
Black for a new contractual self-regulatory body would not be a satisfactory solution. 
The proposal is considered to be an insufficiently clean break from the current PCC 
and the failings associated with that organisation. In the event that this system was 
established, it is anticipated by the Module 4 CPVs that complainants would be likely 
to prefer court proceedings as a forum for seeking redress.”

2.37  Harriet Harman QC MP listed her concerns with the proposal:39

“Our concerns are:
The system would remain voluntary – newspapers would be free to choose whether 
to opt in or not. Members of the public who wanted to complain about non-members 
would have no redress

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFIt is by no means certain that all publications will sign the contract, whether new 
entrants to the market would sign in future, or whether signatories would renew any 
contract 
There would be a chilling effect on the system as adverse adjudications could deter 
proprietors from signing the contract or renewing the contract
The system would not be independent – it would still be run by the industry, for the 
industry
Contracts would be between the press itself – they would not necessarily help the 
public.”

2.38  The Media Standards Trust similarly raised concerns that there were insufficient incentives 
either to join or to stay in the system and that the reliance on goodwill to keep publishers in 
the system would make it difficult to impose any meaningful sanction on a publisher.40

2.39  The British and Irish Ombudsman Association said that they did not consider the proposed 
model to be appropriate because it would be wrong for the dispute-resolution body not to be 
independent of the regulator and the remedies proposed were too limited.41

2.40 

Benefits to the public
It is important to note that the proposal put forward by Lord Black gives no rights of any 
sort to members of the public. The contracts are between the publishers and the regulators. 
Third parties have no rights under the contract and nothing else in the proposal gives those 
who are either customers of the press or victims of press behaviour any rights in relation to 
complaints or redress. Lord Black acknowledged this, but suggested that the rights of third 
parties would be protected by the potential to take an action for judicial review.42 Whilst it is 
arguable whether the Trust, as envisaged in this proposal, would be subject to judicial review, 
Lord Black repeated to the Inquiry that it would be unlikely that the industry would contest 
that point.43

2.41  This is not a sufficiently credible answer. It is surprising, given the evidence that has been put 
before the Inquiry of the harm that the press can do, and have done, to the lives of ordinary 
individuals, that the industry has not felt it necessary to address anywhere in the system the 
rights of individuals. I have said, many times, that any new regulatory system must work for 
the public and for a system to work for the public it should have the rights and interests of the 
public at its heart. This proposal manifestly fails that test.

What difference will it make?

2.42  The credibility of the system must also depend on the impact that it would have. The Inquiry 
sought evidence from editors as to the practical differences that the proposal would make if 
it was implemented. The detail of those responses is set out below,44 but the overwhelming 
answer was that it would make no practical difference whatsoever. Some editors noted that

44 Section 6

1622

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKthey would have to make procedural or administrative changes, but there was no suggestion 
from any editor that Lord Black’s proposal would require any changes to the ethical conduct 
or approach to standards within their title. 

2.43 

It  is  fair  to  say  that  all  the  editors  who  provided  evidence  argued  that  standards  in  their 
newsrooms  were  already  high  and  it  might  be  argued  that  the  question  could  be  said  to 
assume, for each title, that change was necessary. I simply note that the abuses of which the 
Inquiry has heard evidence, and which are documented in this Report, have happened under 
the current systems of standards governance in place within newsrooms and that all have 
recognised that the public has lost confidence in that system. If the proposals put forward by 
Lord Black would not make any practical or cultural difference, then it is difficult to see how 
they could be said to be a sufficient answer to the problem that the Inquiry has identified.

Scope and membership

2.44  The proposal includes provision to allow the Industry Funding Body (IFB) absolute discretion 
to refuse membership. Lord Black explained that this provision was essentially to allow the 
industry to refuse membership to top shelf publications, whose membership would be wholly 
inappropriate  because  they  would  only  give  rise  to  complaints  about  taste  and  decency, 
which was outside the scope of the body.45 I find this problematic. First, it is difficult to see 
why it should be the IfB, rather than the Trust itself, which takes decisions on whether or 
not it is appropriate for a publisher to be a member of the Trust. Secondly, and of greater 
significance, the provision as drafted allows the IFB to refuse membership to any publisher 
for any reason, giving rise to the possibility that a publisher could be excluded for commercial 
or other reasons. finally, I do not understand the problem about taste and decency. If such a 
complaint is outside the scope of the code (as at present), it will be very easy to deal with it. 
It seems to me that it is essential that any regulatory body, self or otherwise, should be open 
to all in the industry to participate in on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis. 

3.	 Fairness	and	objectivity	of	standards
3.1 

This criterion specifies the need for a credible statement of ethical standards, set in a way 
that is sufficiently independent of media interests to command public respect.

3.2 

Under Lord Black’s proposal the Code Committee would retain responsibility for defining the 
standards to be complied with by the press, including the definition of the public interest, 
albeit with the regulator having to approve any changes to the code. The Code Committee 
would  comprise  17  members,  of  whom  12  would  be  serving  editors,  with  three  public 
members and the Chair and Chief Executive of the regulator.46 This clearly puts the definition 
of the public interest in the hands of industry, not of the public as represented by the majority 
independent members on the Board. Lord Black was reluctant to contemplate the idea that 
the Committee might instead, have an equal number of public members and serving editors:47

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF“I think that the Code Committee is, in effect, the only – because there are independent 
majorities throughout the rest of this, the Code Committee is the only genuinely self-
regulatory  bit.  I  think  there  is  significant  moral  authority  that  comes  from  a  code 
which is written by a committee with significant public involvement but that is written 
by editors. So I think there would be some fairly robust views expressed about a view 
that there should be parity on that.”

He indicated that, in his opinion, the industry would be unlikely to accept such a change.48

3.3 

If  one  were  to  accept  that  it  is  reasonable  for  the  industry  to  be  in  a  majority  in  writing 
the code, it is also worth considering whether it is appropriate that those representing the 
industry should be serving editors. Lord Black argued that this was essential:49

“this has always been the Editors’ Code and it has always been the view that it is 
important that editors write it. That is the way that their newsrooms buy into it. That 
is the way the publishers buy into it.”

3.4 

Lord  Black  denied  that  serving  editors  would  have  a  degree  of  self-interest  in  how  the 
standards set in the code:50

“LORD  JUSTICE  LEVESON:  It  might  be  thought  they  have  a  certain  degree  of  self-
interest. 
A. They have self-interest in making the code work.
MR JAY: I think it was you, Lord Black, who used the phrase “buy into it”, which is a 
synonym for self-interest, isn’t it?
A. No, I don’t think it is a synonym for self-interest. I meant “buy into it” in terms of 
they are the ones that have got to make sure their colleagues stick by the letter of it, 
they’re the ones that have to deal with any complaints that come in under the terms 
of it. They need to know that it is a practical document. They need intellectual buy in, 
as much as anything else.”

He argued instead that only serving editors would have the practical day-to-day understanding 
of what life was like in newsrooms and how the rules needed to change to reflect that.51

3.5 

I simply do not accept that. Whilst I recognise the importance of having a strong editorial 
voice  advising  on  standards,  it  seems  to  me  quite  wrong  that  editors  should  actually  be 
responsible  for  setting  standards.  It  would  be  quite  reasonable  for  the  Trust  Board  to  be 
advised by the Code Committee, constituted as Lord Black proposes, but the Board should 
retain responsibility for the code. It is arguable that the Trust Board does have the final say 
on the code in this proposal, as they would have to agree any changes to the code, but the 
distinction is important. Whatever mechanism is put in place as to the weight to be attached 
to advice from the Code Committee, I am not clear that allowing serving editors to set the 
code provides sufficient independence from the industry to command public respect.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK4.	

4.1 

Independence	and	transparency	of	enforcement	and	
compliance
This criterion covers the mechanisms for enforcement and compliance, the independence of 
the bodies carrying out those roles and the methods by which they do so.

‘Independently led self-regulation’
Lord Black presented the model as ‘independently led self-regulation’:52

4.2 

“it  is  a  self-regulatory  system  because  it  is  generated  from  within  the  newspaper 
industry and relies on the newspaper industry for funding, but it is independently led in 
that all the component parts of the regulator have very clear independent majorities 
in  it  and  that  those  independent  majorities  are  guaranteed  by  the  independent 
appointment processes that the trust board will put into place. So it is self-regulation 
but it is led and managed by a wholly independent body.”

4.3 

It is worth considering what is meant by ‘independently-led’ here and the extent to which 
the proposals address the fundamental requirement for independence. The first issue that 
commonly  gives  rise  to  an  impression  that  the  current  system  is  not  independent  is  the 
presence of serving editors on both the Code Committee and the Complaints Committee. The 
proposal before the Inquiry retains both, albeit with the addition of an independent voice in 
the Code Committee. 

4.4 

Lord Black defended this position:53

“I  used  the  phrase  earlier  “independently  led  self-regulation”.  If  the  “self”  in  that 
phrase is to mean anything, then it has to mean the presence of editors on the Code 
Committee, albeit buttressed by a minority of lay members, and it has to mean the 
expertise of senior serving newspaper figures on the complaints committee, again, 
though, in a substantial minority.
What we’ve tried to do here is to make sure that actually the complaints arm and the 
standards investigation arm are structurally shielded from the industry funding body, 
whose powers are significantly diminished from the existing Press Standards Board 
of Finance, which is why the key in this body is the presence of this new trust board.”

4.5 

I do not accept that the concept of ‘self-regulation’ requires the presence of serving editors 
either on the body that sets the standards, although, as I have indicated, I recognise that it 
would certainly be desirable that serving editors should have an advisory role in standards 
setting, or on the body that takes decisions on complaints. Self-regulation can equally mean 
self-owned and self-designed regulation, by independent people, led by a Chairman appointed 
by a panel which included ‘self’. The Industry’s unwillingness to address public concern on 
this matter is a real indication that the proposal to a significant extent represents a broad 
continuation of the status quo rather than a fundamental shift in attitude or an acceptance of 
the need for independent regulation.

4.6 

The second issue that has been raised, particularly in the context of Mr Desmond’s decision 
to leave the PCC, is the way that a few powerful individuals have been able to dominate the 
system. This has been an observed flaw in the existing system and Lord Black acknowledged 

52 pp45-46, lines 21-4,Lord Black, ibid
53 pp78-79, lines 14-3, Lord Black, ibid

1625

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFthat  there  is  nothing  in  the  new  system  to  prevent  it  from  recurring  or  continuing.54  This 
therefore remains a weak point in the proposed system, which would need to be addressed 
for the new system to be genuinely independent. 

4.7 

Objects
It has been pointed out by a number of commentators that the proposal is very much focused 
around the industry’s interests. This is particularly evident in the formulation of the objects of 
the Community Interest Company that would be the regulator:55

“Activities  which  benefit  the  community,  in  particular  to  promote  and  uphold  the 
highest professional standards of journalism.”
[…..]
“Having regard at all times to the importance in a democratic society of the freedom 
of expression and the public’s right to know.”

There is nothing in these objects about the rights of individuals or the importance of the 
public interest in other rights beyond freedom of expression, such as an individual’s right to 
privacy. Lord Black argued that these concepts were embodied within the phrase “the highest 
professional standards of journalism”.56 I can see no reason why it would not be sensible for 
these matters to be reflected explicitly in the objects of the regulator, and I welcome Lord 
Black’s statement that he has no objection to the Article 8 rights being set out.57

4.8 

Independence from Government
This  criterion,  which  is  clearly  extremely  important,  requires  that  the  enforcement  of 
standards should be independent of Government. Lord Black argued that the only way to 
ensure this independence was to have full self-regulation with no statutory involvement of 
any kind. I look in detail at the arguments surrounding statutory recognition of self-regulation 
and statutory underpinning to self-regulation later in the Report.58 Here it suffices to say that 
the proposed industry model has no point of contact with Government and would certainly 
remain independent from Government.

4.9 

Structures and appointments 
The  independence  of  the  system  will  depend  largely  on  the  structures,  but  also  on  the 
independence of the procedures by which key post holders are appointed. 

The Trust Board

4.10  The  most  important  appointment,  self  evidently,  is  the  Chair  of  the  Trust  Board.  The 
appointment of the Chair, who would have no press background, would be made by a four 
person  panel  with  two  industry  members  and  two  public  members,  making  a  unanimous 
decision.59  Lord  Black  defended  this  process  as  “independent  of  press  interests”  on  the

1626

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKgrounds that it was a “balance” with neither press nor lay interests having control of it.60 I 
do not find this entirely convincing. A requirement for unanimity across an equally weighted 
panel effectively gives a veto to either side. That is certainly balance of a kind, but it puts a 
considerable amount of influence in the hands of the industry in relation to what should be 
an independent appointment. Lord Black indicated that the proposal in front of the Inquiry 
was the industry’s “best current shot”61 and that he would look at an alternative model that 
would provide a majority of lay members on the panel.62 In my opinion, it is of fundamental 
importance that the Chair of any regulatory body should be independently appointed, and a 
mechanism that puts a veto in the hands of the industry does not constitute an independent 
process.

4.11  The other members of the Board would be three lay people and three press representatives. 
The  lay  people  would  be  appointed  by  an  independent  process  to  be  determined  by  the 
Board. The industry representatives would be individuals with senior editorial or publishing 
experience, but not serving editors, and would be appointed by the IFB.63 If the issue around 
the appointment of the Chair were resolved, these procedures would appear to provide for 
independently appointed independent members to hold  the majority on the Trust Board. 
It would also be important that, if those appointed with editorial or publishing experience 
remain in employment, they are appointed with true independence and not merely as proxies.

The Code Committee

4.12  The Code Committee would comprise 12 or 13 industry members, drawn from across the 
industry.64 These 12 or 13 would be serving editors but no evidence has been presented on 
how they are to be “drawn from across the industry”. The Chairman and the CEO of the Trust 
would automatically sit on the Code Committee, and the Trust Board would appoint a further 
three public members who may, but do not need to, be members of the Board or of the 
Complaints Committee.65 The proposal to introduce public members to the Code Committee 
must be regarded as a positive step. 

4.13 

I have already set out my views on the extent to which it is inappropriate to have serving 
editors  responsible,  albeit  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Board,  for  setting  the  standards 
to  which  they  are  expected  to  adhere.  I  do  not,  therefore,  regard  the  Code  Committee, 
in  a  standards  setting  capacity,  as  sufficiently  independent  of  industry.  As  I  have  equally 
made clear, however, I do think that the body as described could operate appropriately as 
an advisory body with the Trust Board having final responsibility for the code. I appreciate 
that advice from such a body would have to be accorded appropriate respect, that it would 
be  important  for  editors  to  ‘buy  into’  the  code  and  that  the  Trust  Board  would  therefore 
be  extremely  reluctant  to  approve  a  change  contrary  to  the  views  of  the  Committee  but, 
although to some extent symbolic, the difference is important. As will equally be clear when 
considering  the  Complaints  Committee  below,  the  suggestion  that  those  in  charge  of  the 
regulated entities should be responsible for the code pursuant to which they are regulated is 
not one that would (or should) command support.

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFThe Complaints Committee

4.14  The  Complaints  Committee  comprises  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  seven  lay  members 
appointed  by  an  independent  process,  and  five  working  editors.66  One  concern  would  be 
that having serving editors on the complaints body creates the perception, at the very least, 
of a lack of independence. Indeed, it is the presence of serving editors on the Complaints 
Committee that gives rise to the concept of editors marking their own homework. Ed Richards 
and Colette Bowe from Ofcom gave their clear opinion that:67

“in terms of code setting, in terms of sanctions, in terms of corrections or anything 
of that kind and in terms of policy making overall, you need to have a bright line 
separation between those who are regulating and making decisions and those who 
are regulated, and I think any breach of that [….] means that you will immediately 
undermine the perception and indeed in reality the actuality of your independence.”

Lord Black argued that the industry view was that:68

“these need to be people who are absolutely at the cutting edge of their trade.” 

He said that the independence of the Complaints Committee was adequately ensured by the 
independent majority on the Committee and the right of appeal to an independent assessor:69

“I think that body is constructed so that it has a tangibly clear independent majority 
on  it,  and  we’re  also,  as  you’re  seeing  at  the  bottom,  building  in  an  independent 
assessment of that. So if there was a member of the public who had any concern 
about the process in the way it had been handled, that one of these minority editors 
had had some sort of undue influence, that independent assessment, which would be 
by somebody who had nothing to do with the newspaper industry, would be thrown 
up.”

4.15  The possibility that retired editors, for example in academic positions, or an NUJ representative, 
could  provide  the  required  knowledge  to  the  Committee  was  dismissed  by  Lord  Black, 
although someone who edited a ‘website within a newspaper’ might be considered.70

4.16  Again, I do not consider that this brings the required degree of independence from industry 
to  the  enforcement  of  standards.  An  argument  is  often  advanced  that  doctors  sit  on  the 
British  Medical  Association  disciplinary  panels  so  there  cannot  be  a  problem  with  editors 
on  the  Complaints  Committee.  The  problem  with  this  argument  is  that  individual  doctors 
are  not  to  be  compared  to  editors:  there  is  only  a  very  small  pool  of  national  editors  to 
draw from, making it impossible to create a panel where the members would not know the 
people on whom they were adjudicating and have views about them and their title. I have 
not considered whether it would be appropriate for there to be a role for a serving editor to 
be able to provide written advice to the Complaints Committee, but I do not accept that the 
Committee should have serving editors sitting on it.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKThe Compliance and Investigation Panel

4.17  The  Trust  Board  would  maintain  a  ‘pool  of  experts’  from  whom  they  could  appoint  a 
Compliance and Investigation Panel when the need arose. The names of the people in the 
pool would be published and each specific panel would be appointed, by the Trust Board, to 
suit the specific demands of an investigation.71 The basic structure here seems sufficiently 
independent from any relevant interest. The Inquiry has not been given enough information 
about the methods by which the experts will be appointed to the panel to take a view on the 
adequacy of those processes, but there are no immediate concerns here.

The Industry Funding Body

4.18  The  Inquiry  has  been  given  no  information  about  the  composition  or,  of  appointment 

procedures for, the IFB as Lord Black explained:72

“while we have been able to establish some general principles about its operation, 
the  details  are  still  in  progress,  and  will  need  to  be  subject  to  a  further  round  of 
industry consultation.”

Clearly the IfB will not, and cannot, be independent of industry. It is undeniable, however, 
that  there  is  very  real  merit  in  it  being  considerably  more  transparent  so  that  the  public 
are aware of the different influences within the IFB. The most significant point of interest is 
around the relationship between the IFB and the Trust Board. 

Relationship between the IFB and the Trust

4.19  One of the arguments put forward by Lord Black as to the enhanced independence of his 
proposal, by comparison with the PCC, is the fact that the IFB has a relationship only with 
the Trust Board, not with the operational parts of the regulatory organisation. This assertion 
bears closer scrutiny, in particular as it impacts on the investigations and compliance role 
of the regulator. An exchange between Mr Jay and Lord Black sets out clearly the extent to 
which the Trust Board, with whom the IFB have their direct relationship, has responsibility for 
all the significant decisions in relation to an investigation:73

“Q…but are we agreed to this extent: that trust board approval is required to establish 
an investigation? Is that right?
A. Yes.
Q.  Trust  board  approval  is  also  required  to  take  action  to  enforce  the  contract  in 
relation to an investigation; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. The trust board, you’ve told me this earlier, handles appeals against a finding of 
the compliance and investigation panel.
A. By setting up a new panel.
Q. By setting up a new bundle (sic). And the trust board must take the decision on 
raising any fine in relation to an investigation; is that right?

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFA. Correct.
Q. And the trust board also ratifies changes to the code, doesn’t it?
A. Yes.”

4.20  Whilst  there  is  nothing  objectionable  in  the  Trust  Board  having  these  roles  in  respect  of 
investigations, it is not possible, in the light of this, to also argue that the IFB, by interacting 
only with the Trust Board, has no interactions with parts of the body that are taking regulatory 
decisions.  The  Trust  Board  is  quite  clearly  taking  regulatory  decisions  here;  indeed,  it  is 
responsible for all of the most significant regulatory decisions in relation to an investigation. 
Lord  Black  argued  that  this  would  not  matter  as  investigations  would  be  funded  from  a 
ring-fenced enforcement fund, which is to be established at the outset and will not be the 
responsibility of the IfB.74 This is not a sufficient argument. The influence of the IFB derives 
from its position as the funding body for the regulator, but is not therefore limited to matters 
that fall to be funded by it. The risk, surely, is that the Trust Board might seek to avoid causing 
friction with the IFB in relation to investigations in order to preserve a good relationship on 
the wider funding issue.

4.21  The IFB has a number of other roles in the system. It is responsible for the code, although 
the code must be agreed by the Trust. The Trust is responsible for the Regulations, though 
they must be agreed by the IFB. These complementary roles provide a model of regulation in 
which the industry has a very strong say, both through being in the lead in setting standards 
and having a veto over the Regulations governing the maintenance of those standards. Lord 
Black argued that this was a very important system of checks and balances, to protect the 
industry from a regulator which might want to make changes that would destroy the industry 
whilst  simultaneously  protecting  the  regulator  from  any  attempt  by  the  industry  to  scale 
back regulation. He did, however, suggest that a stipulation could be added to the contract 
that  no  changes  to  the  contract  or  to  the  regulations  could  ever  dilute  the  power  of  the 
regulator.75 In relation to changes to the code, Lord Black said that the Trust Board would have 
the ultimate responsibility for a change, with the IFB essentially having a role in managing a 
prior consultation process. He recognised that this was not what the documents provided to 
the Inquiry set out and that some redrafting would be necessary to achieve that effect.76

4.22  The powers of the IFB, which run throughout this proposal, undermine claims to independence 
of the regulatory system. Lord Black talks of independently led-self regulation but it is not 
clear that leadership in this system can come from the Trust. Rather, there is a joint system 
of leadership between the Trust and the IfB in which the IfB has the lead in many important 
issues, in particular the funding of the body, the definition of the code and setting sanctions 
guidelines; it also has significant influence in many others, such as the appointment of the 
Trust  Chair  and  changes  to  the  Regulations.  Removing  the  IFB  from  decision  relating  to 
appointments, the code, the Regulations and sanctions would go a long way to enhancing 
the independence of the proposed system.

Complaint handling

4.23  Members  of  the  new  system  will  be  expected  to  try  to  resolve  complaints  directly  with 
the  complainant  in  the  first  instance.  The  intention  here  is  to  improve  transparency  and 
accountability within publishers, as well as to reduce the workload for the regulator.77 This is 
a sensible development.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKThird party complaints

4.24  The proposal would give the regulator the power to take up a third party complaint where 
there  has  been  a  significant  breach  of  the  Editors’  Code  and  there  is  a  substantial  public 
interest in allowing the complaint to be brought.78 Lord Black gave evidence that the new body, 
in line with current practice in the PCC, would always be able to take third party complaints 
on a matter of accuracy.79 That is not reflected in the drafting of the regulations, which would 
appear to restrict third party accuracy complaints to “significant breaches” with a “substantial 
public interest”. Lord Black provided assurance that it was not intended to have that effect, 
but  on  the  contrary  was  intended  to  make  it  easier  for  groups  to  bring  discrimination 
complaints under the discrimination clause of the code;80 it remained important, however, 
for the regulator to have discretion over when to take up third party or group complaints on 
issues such as discrimination.81 As it stands, this wording appears to significantly raise the 
threshold for third party complaints about accuracy. I accept Lord Black’s assurance that this 
is not the intention but it is important that that point should be clarified. 

Compliance reports

4.25  The proposed scheme introduces annual compliance reports which would set out compliance 
systems and report on any compliance breaches and the steps taken to remedy them. These 
reports  form  an  important  part  of  the  standards  function  of  the  new  model.  The  reports 
would be sent to the Head of Standards and Investigations (an official position at the Trust) 
whose team would analyse the reports. It is anticipated that this will lead to dialogue with 
the publishers about the actions that they have taken over the year and the extent to which 
the report demonstrates active compliance with the standards. Once the reports are finalised 
it is expected that they will be published. The contract would require regulated entities to 
be open and cooperative towards the regulator and to disclose any significant breaches of 
the code promptly.82 It would be open to the Trust to take action, including potentially the 
launch of a full scale investigation, to require the reports to be full and frank should that be 
necessary. The process of reaching agreement on the annual report between the publisher 
and the regulator would be a proportionate one, taking into account the size and nature of 
the publisher.83

4.26  This  proposal  strikes  me  as  an  eminently  sensible  one.  It  must  be  right  that  the  primary 
responsibility for compliance lies with the company and they should be encouraged to take 
that  responsibility  seriously.  A  requirement  of  this  sort  should  significantly  enhance  the 
transparency  of  compliance  across  the  industry  and  put  pressure  on  management  within 
each title to ensure that they have a good story to tell. It might also be reasonable to suggest 
that newspapers should publish their annual compliance reports in their own pages to ensure 
that their readers have easy access to the information.

1631

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF4.27  The  proposal  also  requires  publishers  to  identify  a  named  senior  individual  within  each 
company who is responsible for the maintenance of standards, compliance with the code 
of  practice, reporting  annually  to  the  regulator  and  then  dealing  with  the  follow  up  from 
the  regulator.84  Arguments  may  be  made  about  whether  that  senior  individual  should,  of 
necessity, be the editor or the proprietor but, in any event, this also seems like a sensible 
innovation that could, if operated properly, encourage real change within organisations.

Whistleblowing

4.28  Lord Hunt raised a concern that had not been picked up by the industry proposal, namely that 
there should be a whistleblowing hotline into the new regulatory structure for those who feel 
that they are being asked to do things which are contrary to the code.85 It is a shame that this 
has not been taken on board by the industry proposal: it is obviously sensible.

5.	 Powers	and	remedies
5.1 

The sanctions available to the regulator differ substantially depending on whether an issue is 
dealt with via the complaints arm or the standards arm. The Complaints Committee has the 
power to issue an adverse adjudication, and to negotiate the wording, size and placement of 
a correction or apology, but it cannot impose a fine, even in an egregious case.86

Complaints

5.2 

Lack of adjudication
Lord  Black  explained  that  conciliation  remained  at  the  heart  of  the  proposed  complaints 
process because “the bulk of complaints will lend themselves to conciliation.” 87 It would be 
open to the regulator, in the case of a serious breach that could nonetheless be resolved to 
the complainant’s satisfaction by way of conciliation, to reach a full-scale adjudication. The 
Complaints Committee can call on a publisher to take disciplinary action against an editor. 

5.3  My  concern  in  this  context  is  that  a  great  proportion  of  the  complaints  made  to  the  PCC 
currently are rejected at the first point of contact, and the vast majority of those that are 
looked at are resolved through mediation. Just because it has proved possible to resolve a 
complaint to the satisfaction of the complainant without a formal adjudication there is no 
guarantee that a breach of the code was not committed; indeed, the reverse is likely to be the 
case on the basis that the clear cases will be conceded and redress provided. On the other 
hand, only those few that go to a full adjudication ever get to the stage at which a breach of 
the code is recorded. This allows the fiction that only a handful of breaches of the code occur 
each year to go unchallenged.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.4 

Lord Black told the Inquiry that it would be open to the regulator to decide that it wished to 
adjudicate more. In particular this would be helpful for the regulator when considering best 
practice guidelines which would tend to be informed by adjudications. Lord Black accepted 
that there was no principled objection to setting some sort of threshold above which cases 
would automatically go forward to adjudication:88

“Q.  Do  you  think  it  might  be  better  to  have  a  sort  of  threshold  written  into  the 
regulations which, if the regulator thought that there was prima facie evidence of a 
serious breach of the code or breach of the code which was other than minimum or 
raised minor questions of inaccuracy, then unless the complainant wished otherwise, 
almost  as  a  matter  of  obligation,  the  regulator  should  take  that  forward  to  an 
adjudication? 
A. I would expect that to be the best practice of the regulator. If there’s a case for 
writing that in, if it can be codified in a way which can be written into regulations, 
then I wouldn’t see a principled objection to that……I would hope it would be a matter 
of best practice, but if there is merit in codifying it, we will.”

5.5 

I  think  this  is  very  important:  the  regulator  must  have  a  clear  sense  of  the  scale  of  code 
breaches that it is dealing with both in relation to individual publishers and in relation to 
the industry as a whole. This information about breaches of the code would be of critical 
importance to the management at the individual publishers and to the regulator in its role 
of promoting and maintaining standards. It is also important that mediated complaints are 
recorded, with code breaches identified. It is difficult to see how systemic failures in code 
compliance could be detected if code breaches are not identified as such by the Complaints 
Committee. 

Remedies and sanctions available for complaints
The remedies and sanctions available to the Complaints Committee are described as:89

5.6 

“…a ladder of sanctions from a fairly straightforward correction through to a breach 
of the code that’s remedied and identified in statistics, through to a formal reprimand 
of the editor, right up to where there has been a very serious breach and that leads 
to a referral from the complaints arm to the publisher because it raises contractual 
disputes…”

5.7  Whilst this was presented as a change, the only thing that this proposal adds to the current 
armoury of the PCC is the power to refer the matter to the complaints arm. Lord Hunt did not 
dissent from that, saying “it’s a simple codification of it….” 90

5.8 

It is notable that the regulations do not appear to give the regulator the power to determine 
where an adjudication or apology should be placed. Lord Black suggested that it was possible 
that this could be changed but that it would be a matter for the Code Committee, subject to 
Trust Board ratification, to change.91 I welcome Lord Black’s implication that this is an area 
where some movement may be seen, but it is, again, surprising that the industry has not 
already moved on this issue if they are inclined to do so. It is, frankly, absurd that the regulator 
should not have the power to determine the location of an adjudication or apology.

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF5.9 

Compensation
The regulator is given no powers to award compensation. The explanation for this is that 
if  compensation  were  available  to  complainants  through  the  regulatory  process  it  would 
complicate  the  conciliation  process.92  Lord  Black  suggested  that  if  the  regulator  were  to 
have the power to award compensation then complainants would always tend to want the 
regulator to deal with their complaint rather than getting the individual publisher to deal with 
it; furthermore, it is likely that the publisher would be even more defensive than presently is 
the case. 

5.10  There is also another substantial difficulty. Although it might be possible to specify a right 
to  compensation  for  a  breach of  the  code  that  did  not  involve breach of  the  civil  law (as 
can be awarded by Ombudsmen for maladministration), in the main the issues likely to lead 
to a reasonable expectation of compensation are those which give rise to a claim for civil 
damages. If the regulator had the power to award compensation, it is likely that it would be 
sought as a matter of course; instead of providing what should be speedy redress by way of 
apology and correction, arguments will develop about the extent of the breach and the way 
in which compensation should be approached. There is a real risk that lawyers for both sides 
would become involved, with the result that the system could collapse under its own weight. 
An arbitral arm could provide swift financial redress in appropriate breaches of the civil law. 
In the circumstances, I am inclined to agree with Lord Black that it would be better for the 
complaints arm not to have the power to award compensation.

5.11  Limiting the sanctions available to the Complaints Committee to those set out in paragraph 
5.6 does mean that, short of legal action by a complainant, a publisher is unlikely to suffer 
financial penalties for a single abuse, no matter how egregious it might be. However, in the 
event of a complaint about a particularly egregious breach of the code, it would be possible 
for  the  Complaints  Committee  to  refer  the  matter  to  the  Investigations  arm,  which  could 
then, with the approval of the Trust Board, initiate an investigation. This could culminate in 
a fine if the single egregious breach were considered to demonstrate a complete failure of 
internal governance within the company.93

Contemporaneous civil proceedings

5.12  The proposal does not allow for the regulator to hear a complaint if it is the subject of current 
legal proceedings. A joint submission from ANL, GNM and TMG points out that s114 of the 
Broadcasting  Act  1996  prevents  Ofcom  from  considering  fairness  cases  where  the  matter 
is the subject of proceedings in a court of law.94 That submission argues that the nature of 
defamation means that it is essential that both sides in a civil case should be able to argue their 
case freely, and that the existence of parallel regulatory proceedings might make it difficult 
for the defendants to offer a full defence because of regulatory concerns. Notwithstanding 
that, Lord Black conceded that there was a case for allowing the regulator to look at pure 
code or ethics issues that are unconnected to the libel proceedings whilst those proceedings 
are underway.95

1634

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.13  Lord  Black  further  considered  that  there  was  nothing  to  stop  the  Complaints  Committee 
considering a complaint before a libel action was brought, and went further saying that he 
would expect the new regulator to take the view that this could happen.96 Lord Black also 
expressed the view that a successful court action might “almost be an automatic trigger for 
a  full  scale  investigation,” 97  thus  ensuring  that  the  regulator  would  look  at  the  standards 
implications of successful civil action against a publisher. 

5.14 

I  remain  to  be  convinced  that  there  is  any  particularly  unique  problem  associated  with 
defamation that makes it impossible for court and regulatory action to be taken simultaneously. 
It seems reasonable that a court should be able to stay the regulatory action if continuing it 
would  endanger  the  civil  action,  but  that  is  no  reason  for  a  blanket  ban  on  the  regulator 
considering regulatory issues without waiting for any legal action to be completed first. I very 
much agree with Lord Black that a new regulator should take the view that a complainant 
can bring a complaint prior to taking legal action if they so wish, and I would consider that it 
should be made clear in the contract and regulations that this is the case.

Investigations

5.15  An investigation can be triggered by a number of events, described as “serious or systemic 
breaches”. It is accepted that this could include one serious breach where it was clear that 
the breach had arisen because controls were not in place in the newsroom to prevent it.98

Process

5.16  An investigations panel, once established, would have the power to view documents and, 
in theory, to summon witnesses. It was accepted, however, that, whilst the power to view 
documents could be enforced through the courts, the power to call witnesses would not be 
enforceable,99 although failure on the part of a publisher to provide a witness once called for 
would constitute a breach of an obligation.100

5.17  The  investigation  procedure  is  set  out  in  some  detail,  requiring  a  substantial  amount  of 
oversight  by  the  Trust  Board  and  offering  a  number  of  opportunities  for  the  investigated 
party to make representations or appeal. First, the investigation can only be established by 
the Trust Board.101 The regulated entity has an opportunity to make representations that the 
investigation should not be set up.102 If a dispute arises between the Head of Standards and 
the regulated entity it must be referred to the Trust Board.103 Any requirement to bring legal 
proceedings to compel production of documents must be approved by the Trust Board.104 Once 
a report has been prepared in draft it must be sent to the regulated entity, which has 28 days 
to make submissions.105 The regulated entity is then invited to the meeting of the investigation 
panel to discuss the draft report in order to be able to make further representations.106 The

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFpreliminary decision of the panel must be sent to the regulated entity, which then has 14 days 
to make comments.107 Once the investigation panel has made its final decision, having had 
the benefit of all these submissions, the regulated entity can appeal to the Trust Board for a 
new panel to be set up to look at the matter again.108 The regulated entity then similarly has 
the opportunity to make representations to the review panel preliminary findings.109

5.18  There  can  be  no  objection  to  procedural  fairness,  and  it  is  right  that  the  subject  of  an 
investigation should have an appropriate opportunity to make their case and to ensure fair 
treatment.  However,  the  process  described  above  appears  somewhat  extreme  and  could 
be thought to give so many opportunities to the regulated entity to challenge every single 
step so as to frustrate the investigation and make it very difficult for the regulator to reach 
a conclusion, particularly if that conclusion was adverse. Lord Black defended the process, 
arguing that:110

“I  don’t  think  it  can  be  overstated  quite  how  serious  an  adverse  finding  from  the 
standards and compliance panel of the new regulator would be, and therefore I think 
the regulated entity needs to be dealt with fairly and proportionately and that means 
they should have the ability to put their case at certain points during this. That would 
just seem to me to be natural equity and natural justice.”

5.19  He went on to say:111

“I think it highly unlikely that during the course of an investigation a regulated entity 
would take every single opportunity to try to derail it, but even if it did, then the trust 
board and the investigation and compliance panel must plough on and it will get to 
the right place in the end.”

5.20 

5.21 

I am not sure that this is acceptable. These provisions have obviously been drafted to take 
into account the anxieties of the publishers about the implications of an investigation and I 
do, of course, recognise the need for them to have a full say in the process. However, if there 
is to be any value in the investigations process, which is itself the only genuinely new part 
of this proposal from the industry, then it is essential that it should be capable of operating 
without continually being frustrated by those subject to regulation. I do not have a particular 
view on what is the right number of opportunities for an investigated party to appeal against 
the process but I am clear that, as currently drafted, it goes too far in that direction with 
the serious risk of entirely undermining that effectiveness of the investigation remit of the 
regulator.

I note that the investigations process is entirely between the regulator and the publisher. 
There is no role at all for the victim, or victims, of the behaviour that has given rise to the 
investigation. There is no opportunity for them to submit evidence to the investigation, and 
no opportunity for them to challenge the outcome of the investigation. I recognise that if 
an investigation is looking at systemic failures of governance it may not be easy to identify 
the victims. There is no reason, though, why this should prevent the investigations process 
allowing a role for victims (or, at the very least an obligation on the part of the standards 
investigator  to  consult  the  victim)  where  an  investigation  relates  to  one  or  more  specific 
events in relation to which victims can be identified.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKFines and Sanctions Guidance

5.22  The regulator has the power to impose fines and sanctions, but this must be done in accordance 
with the Fines and Sanctions Guidance issued by the IFB.112 Whist it is entirely reasonable to 
have fines and sanctions guidance, I am completely at a loss as to why that guidance should 
be set by the industry rather than by the regulator. Lord Black did not provide any insight into 
this, but pointed out that once the guidance had been incorporated into the contract the IFB 
would have no power to amend it.113 This is a minor point, but is indicative of the extent to 
which the industry has kept to itself control of the tools that the regulator has. 

Enforcement

5.23  As a result of the contractual nature of the proposal, the regulator has only one method of 
enforcement of its decisions, whether in relation to a complaint or an investigation, which is 
to take action in the courts for an order for performance of the contract. There are a number 
of implications to this. The first, and most obvious, is the cost that the regulator would incur 
in seeking to get his decisions enforced. There will always be a matter of judgment for the 
regulator as to whether it is a good use of his resources (both in time and money) to take 
proceedings. It also means that, even where a regulatory decision has been taken according 
to the Regulations and all possible appeal routes have been exhausted, the publisher will still 
be able to argue as to whether the fine or other decision can be properly enforced under 
the contract.114 This adds a layer of expense and complexity to the regulator’s enforcement 
processes. 

5.24 

It is argued, rightly, that if a publisher were to fail to comply with reasonable requests from 
the regulator, or with regulatory decisions, that this could lead to the opening of a full scale 
investigation. However, the same concerns apply to the enforcement of the outcome, or indeed 
the conduct, of any investigation. There is a risk that the proposed system could be frustrated 
by a publisher who, although having joined the system, was not inclined to cooperate and  
who could appeal every decision and argue every point, with the risk that the regulator would 
either have to devote a substantial amount of his resources to dealing with the problem or  
abandon the attempt to enforce decisions. This strikes me as a structural flaw in the proposal, 
although I do not immediately see a way around it. A body which derived its authority from  
statute or by reason of statutory underpinning would similarly be open to challenge on every 
decision and might similarly face a concerted effort to frustrate its ability to make and enforce 
decisions. The contractual system does, however, provide an extra level of potential challenge 
that would not be available in a system, independently appointed, which derived a measure 
of authority by law.

5.25  A further point also arises, which is about the willingness of the regulator to take any action 
in court to enforce the contract. Any decision to take action against a member to compel 
disclosure of documents must be approved by the Trust Board, and it seems likely that any 
decision with the reputational, operational and financial implications of taking legal action 
against a member would generally be referred to the Board.115 I have already referred to Lord 
Black’s assertion that the complaints arm and the standards investigation arm are structurally 
shielded from the industry funding body. This is certainly true in terms of direct appointments

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFand  day  to  day  operation  but  the  argument  wears  thin  in  relation  to  enforcement  if  the 
decision  to  enforce  a  judgment  of  the  regulator  sits  with  the  Trust  Board.  This  could  be 
avoided by giving the Head of Complaints and the Head of Standards the power to take action 
against member companies, for enforcement purposes, without reference to the Trust Board, 
but it is hard to reconcile that with the Board’s overall responsibility for the regulator and, in 
particular, its budgetary responsibilities. 

6.	 Cost
6.1 

The estimated cost of the proposal is £2.25m per annum, with a separate enforcement fund 
plus set-up costs.116 The cost of the PCC has been in the region of £1.75-£1.95m per annum 
in recent years.117 The proposal is that the industry would pay the full cost of the new system, 
as they currently pay the full cost of the PCC. This was presented by Lord Back as an essential 
aspect  of  a  self-regulatory  system  and  a  demonstration  of  the  industry’s  commitment  to 
standards:118

6.2 

6.3 

“The industry invests in the regulatory system as a sign of its commitment to protecting 
the public and putting right things which have gone wrong.”

It was made clear by a number of witnesses that one of the keys to any independent regulatory 
system was the independence of its funding. Ofcom recommended that any system should 
be based on fixed long term (three or four year) funding agreements which, once fixed, could 
not then be influenced by the funding body. Others have emphasised the need for funding to 
be sufficient to enable the regulator to carry out its duties effectively. I have dealt elsewhere 
with criticisms that although the PCC was funded adequately to operate the complaints and 
mediation service, that funding was sufficiently limited to prevent them from exploring other 
powers, such as powers to investigate, which theoretically were open to them. Lord Black’s 
model seeks to address both points.

Adequacy of funding
The body described in the proposal includes the Trust Board, a Complaints Committee and 
the associated complaints arm, with a full time staff, an Independent Assessor, a Head of 
Standards and Compliance, with a small full time team, and a panel of experts from whom 
investigations panels can be drawn. The Board, the complaints arm and the Assessor will be 
funded from the main budget of £2.25m. This is a larger body than the PCC because, under 
the PCC model, the Board and the Complaints Committee are the same body. Investigations 
undertaken by investigations panel will be funded from the separate enforcement fund. It is 
not clear whether the full time administrative staff in the standards and compliance arm will 
be funded from the main budget or from the enforcement fund. If the full time staff is to be 
funded from the main budget this is an expense not currently incurred under the PCC model.

6.5 

6.6 

The enforcement fund
The enforcement fund is set to start at £100,000,119 thereafter being supplemented by any 
fines, or contributions to investigation costs, that are levied. If the permanent standards and 
investigations staff were to be funded from this £100,000 it is hard to see how there would 
be any capacity at all for ad hoc investigations; this would effectively render the standards 
arm irrelevant. I therefore conclude that the permanent staff will be funded from the main 
budget, with the enforcement fund being held in reserve to pay for investigations when the 
need arises. It is suggested that, with the addition of fines and cost contributions, the size 
of the enforcement fund might rise to £500,000. Given that cost contributions can only at 
best  replenish  what  has  been  spent  on  an  investigation,  this  must  mean  that  there  is  an 
expectation that fines will be levied. It is not clear what is to happen to the enforcement fund 
should early investigations not result in any fines, for it is obviously quite wrong for decisions 
to be made about financial penalties based on the needs of the regulator rather than the 
gravity of the behaviour of the regulated entity. 

It  is  worth  recalling  that  cooperation  with  an  investigation  is  expected  to  be  enforced  as 
a  contractual  obligation  through  the  courts  if  necessary.  The  enforcement  fund  would  be 
exhausted quickly should there be the need for any such enforcement action; there is a risk 
that this could be exploited by a publisher who might adopt an attitude, not unknown in 
litigation, of fighting every single decision and appealing every decision until the other party 
runs out of money. Lord Black took the optimistic view that:120

“I would hope that in a system into which publishers voluntarily entered into a contract 
that they wouldn’t do that.” 

This is only a partial answer. Publishers may voluntarily enter into this agreement because of 
the fear of what might happen otherwise, but the fact that these changes have explicitly only 
been offered because of the threat posed by the Inquiry indicates that the proposal presented 
is not one born of conviction but of expediency. These are not changes that the industry was 
eager to make and, consequently, the idea that publishers will cooperate with investigations 
because they join the system voluntarily rings rather hollow. It is not inconceivable that some 
would join the system voluntarily because they can see the weaknesses in the system that 
would allow them to frustrate its effective operation.

6.7  When these points were put to him Lord Black effectively agreed:121

“That may well be the case. I think we’ve tried in the best way we can to make sure 
that the trust board has the powers and the money available to enforce the contract. 
I think it’s always going to be an issue to do with the nature of contract. If one party 
wants to grind everybody down with legal action, that is going to happen, but in any 
structure of law that’s going to be the case.”

6.8 

The concept of providing a ring-fenced enforcement budget is a good one, but in order to 
be effective it must be enough to allow the regulator to be able to undertake investigations 
even where the publisher concerned might not cooperate. A regulator who cannot afford to 
take enforcement action will lose credibility with both the industry and the public. I am not

1639

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFwell placed to say what the appropriate level of an enforcement fund should be, but what 
is  proposed  has  the  appearance  of  a  very  limited  and  inflexible  enforcement  budget  that 
may  simply  be  wholly  inadequate  to  do  the  job  in  hand,  with  no  obvious  mechanism  for 
addressing such difficulties if they arise.

6.9 

The operational budget
Lord  Black  stressed  that  the  £2.25m  figure  was  an  estimate.  He  suggested  that  the  new 
complaints arm would be dealing with far fewer complaints than the PCC because improved 
governance in newspapers would lead to fewer complaints, and more of those complaints 
that are raised would be dealt with successfully by the publisher rather than the regulator.122 
Against that I set the larger administrative role, with the need to support the Trust Board 
and a full time standards and compliance team in addition to the current PCC structure, and 
Lord Black’s assertions, reflected above, that the new regulator might move to adjudicate a 
higher proportion of complaints in order to ensure that a breach of standards was properly 
recognised and properly dealt with.

6.10  Lord Black said that if there were a need for more funding then the industry would have to sit 
down with the new regulator and look at how much the elements of the new system would 
cost. He said:123

“I have no doubt that sufficient funding will be made available to the regulator to 
fulfil its function.”

I  cannot  be  so  sanguine.  Lord  Black  acknowledged  that  the  level  of  funding  to  be  made 
available to the regulator was solely in the hands of the industry. The requirement to pay will 
be in the contract that publishers sign with the regulatory body, but the amounts that they 
pay will be fixed by the IFB. There are no requirements on the IFB to meet the needs of the 
regulator, who will have to make do with whatever is provided by the IFB. Again, my concern 
is not specifically about the level of funding estimated to be required for the core operations 
of the regulator, but about the absence of any power on the part of the regulator to set the 
funding levels required. 

Independence of funding

6.11  This brings me to the most significant issue in relation to funding. Publishers will sign contracts 
with the regulator that bind them into the system for five years, and those contracts will 
require them to pay the fees set by the IFB. So far, so good. However, Lord Black was clear 
that this commitment was to the principle of funding, not to any particular amount:124

“I  can’t  give  you  guarantees  over  a  five-year  period.  The  industry  might  face  a 
complete economic collapse in that time. What we are doing is making a commit 
through contracts to provide funding over a five-year period. I think it unlikely that 
we would be able to actually build exact figure into that contract because of course, 
the needs of the regulator may change over time.”

124 p76, lines 9-16, Lord Black, ibid

1640

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK6.12  The effect of this proposal, therefore, is that the IFB will set the budget for the regulator on 
a year by year basis. This has practical implications for the regulator, which may not be able 
to  plan  its  operations  effectively  on  a  long  term  basis,  but  much  more  significantly  it  has 
implications for the independence of the regulator.

6.13  The IFB is comprised of representatives of the industry that the regulator is regulating. It is 
easy to see how a regulator which is dependent for the next year’s funding on the goodwill 
of its regulated bodies might be expected to operate with a light touch, and to seek to avoid 
conflict – particularly with those publishers who have the most influence on the IFB. I noted 
earlier that the composition and appointment processes of the IFB remain entirely opaque, so 
the public will never even know who wields that influence and, therefore, who the regulator 
is most likely to want to propitiate. 

6.14  This  direct  relationship  between  major  publishers  and  the  core  decisions  over  funding  of 
the regulator is possibly the single biggest problem with the proposal that Lord Black has 
presented.  There  are,  of  course,  ways  in  which  it  could  be  ameliorated.  A  system  which 
envisaged a fixed budget for the full five year term would significantly address the concerns 
about the continual need for the regulator to appease his funders. A system which required 
the  budgets  to  be  set  by  negotiation  between  the  regulator  and  the  IFB  would  give  the 
regulator more power to articulate, and fight for, the resources he needs to do an effective 
job and to make it clear to the public if this need was not being met. 

Transparency of funding

6.15  A final point on funding is the extent to which it is apparent who is funding the regulatory body. 
The funding of the PCC is shared between national newspapers (59.1%), regional and Scottish 
newspapers (34.4%) and magazines (6.5%).125 However, due to what is described as ‘trade 
association politics’, Lord Black was unable to tell the Inquiry how the national newspaper 
share of the funding is made up.126 He indicated that there might be greater transparency on 
this issue in the future, but was not able to give any guarantees.127

6.16  This is a matter for concern and I would urge those responsible to resolve the matter so that 

there is full transparency over the funding of any self regulatory body.

To what extent is the industry ready to sign up to these 
proposals?
The  Inquiry  sought  evidence  from  those  editors  who  had  previously  given  evidence  as  to

Views from national newspapers
Some  of  the  national  titles  have  indicated  a  firm  readiness  to  sign  up  to  the  proposal, 
specifically the Telegraph Media Group,128 Trinity Mirror129 and Associated News.130

Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times, expressed a willingess in principle to join the 
scheme, but warned that his view of the proposals might change as the details evolved:131

“I am happy to state that in broad terms I am supportive of the proposals and if the 
discussions to finalise them continue as they have to date, then I would anticipate 
recommending to the FTL board that FTL becomes a signatory to the contract. I would 
add  that  Lord  Black’s  system  appears  to  preserve  the  largely  useful  and  effective 
service of complaints handling and mediation currently carried out by the PCC.
It is important to note that Lord Black has made clear that the proposals as submitted 
to the Inquiry remain a draft that is subject to industry comment and which may also 
need to evolve dependent on the recommendations in the Inquiry’s final report. As 
such my view of the proposals may change depending on any changes made to them 
in the course of future consultation. As you might expect, there is certainly some devil 
in the detail to be worked out before the contract is ready for signature.”

7.4  Within News International there was support for the principles underpinning the proposal 

but still, according to the editor of The Sunday Times, a need to sort out details:132

“I  am  ready  to  commit  to  the  broad  principles  of  the  new  contractual  obligations 
though,  of  course,  the  final  authorisation  by  News  International  will  be  made  by 
the News International CEO in consultation with all three Editors. Whilst there are a 
number of details about the proposal that have yet to be worked out, I am hopeful 
that all industry participants will be able to reach final agreement.”
“I am in principle in favour of the proposal to bind participating members of a new 
press body by contracts.” 133
“The  Sunday  Times  is  ready  to  recommend  in  principle  that  the  regulated  entity 
(Times Newspapers Limited) enter into these contractual obligations…..There is some 
finessing in the detail of the framework proposals still to be done which I would hope 
can be achieved by discussion between participants.” 134

They were not able to indicate readiness to sign contracts now.

Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, indicated that, if Lord Black’s proposal was adopted 
after the Inquiry, the Guardian would be prepared to sign up to such a contract, subject to 
negotiation.135 However, he was clear that the proposal did not have his unqualified support:136

“…we believe that improvements are needed including ending the role of an industry 
funding body and strengthening the carrots and sticks for participation in a voluntary 
system. Above all we believe that a more ambitious system is required as part of a new 
settlement between the press and society that reflects the needs of both in today’s 
world.  Significantly,  that  would  include  a  system  of  alternative  dispute  resolution 
that better serves complainants and publishers: strengthened protection for public 
interest  journalism  so  that  the  new  framework  encourages  the  best  in  journalism 
rather  than  merely  protecting  against  the  worst;  and  improvements  to  the  media 
plurality framework which is not a separate issue, but lies at the very heart of the 
culture, practice and ethics of the press.”

7.6 

Chris  Blackhurst,  editor  of  The  Independent,  said  that  he  was  broadly  supportive  of  Lord 
Black’s proposals, in particular in relation to the contractual basis for the relationship with 
the  regulator  and  the  regulator’s  investigative  and  fining  powers.137  However,  he  went  on 
to outline three key issues on which the group would need to see more detail before being 
able to commit to enter into the new system. First, that the system proposed might not be 
sufficiently compelling to persuade all publishers into it, and that:138

“…without the complete support of at least the major publishers, the new system 
may not have sufficient credibility in the eyes of the public and will be hamstrung 
from the outset.”

Second,  Mr Blackhurst  raised  a  question  about  the  appropriateness of  the  maximum  fine 
proposed  and  the  levels  at  which  fines  were  likely  to  be  levied,  and  finally,  he  expressed 
concern about whether the proposed budget of £2.25m was realistic and what the actual 
costs might be.139

7.7 

By contrast, Northern and Shell were clear that they were not yet willing to sign up to the 
scheme; they had specific concerns about the proposal. The editors of The Daily Star, The 
Daily Express, The Sunday Express and The Daily Star Sunday all expressed reservations about 
aspects of the proposals:140

“The Daily Star Newspaper is not ready or committed to sign up to the Proposals in 
their current form and in any event, this commitment can only be made at board 
level. 
Certainly any decision to sign up to a contact under which there is the potential for 
incurring fines of up to £1,000,000 is a decision which would be taken by the board 
of the Company.

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoFIn addition, I personally have concerns in respect of who will be selected to run the 
new  regulatory  body,  how  the  decision  will  be  made  as  to  who  runs  it,  and  how 
decisions are made more generally in terms of how the body will be funded.”

And:141

“At  present,  and  with  the  Proposals  in  their  current  form,  I  would  not  be  able  to 
recommend  to  the  Board  that  The  Daily  Star  Sunday  sign  up  to  these  contractual 
obligations contained in the Proposal for, among others, the following reasons: 
The proposals appear to take a ‘one size fits all’ approach to the contractual obligations 
to which we would be expected to adhere. I do not think that this would be in the best 
interests of the Group titles, other national and regional newspaper titles and the 
public. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that I consider the proposals as drafted do 
not appear to represent equally the interests of those in the industry; 
The proposed contract and its associated penalties are too draconian. The contract 
could damage the commercial prospects and the very future of many titles that are 
bound by it. For example there is no redress if a publisher believes the regulator is 
behaving ill an inappropriate manner. 
The Proposals do not appear to address any potential wrong doing for which there is 
not a ready adequate protection in place under the law;
The  proposals  includes(sic)  provision  for  the  regulator  to  decide  to  carry  out  an 
investigation and impose a sanction even after civil and/or criminal proceedings have 
taken place, irrespective of whether any such proceedings result in the Newspaper 
being found liable and/or guilty.
This list is illustrative of my concerns and is not to be considered exhaustive.”

7.8 

Similarly, Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, which is not currently a member of the PCC, said:142

“Private  Eye  is  not  “at  present  fully  ready  and  committed”  to  enter  into  these 
contractual obligations.”

He  explained  that,  whilst  he  did  regard  the  proposal  as  a  “significant  improvement”  on 
the PCC, his concerns with the proposal centred around the importance of independence 
and impartiality of any panel or committee involved in decisions on complaints. He further 
identified that none of the incentives proposed by Lord Black for membership of the new 
regulatory body would, in fact, provide any incentive to Private Eye.143

Views from the Scottish, Welsh and regional press

7.9  Moving away from the UK national titles there is clearly much more work to be done before 
publishers are ready to sign up to the scheme. None of the Scottish, Irish, Welsh or regional 
titles who gave evidence to the Inquiry said that they were ready to sign up to the PressBoF 
proposal in its current form, though they all supported the broad principles upon which it is 
based. For example, Ian Stewart, editor of the Scotsman, said:144

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK“I agree with the general thrust of Lord Black’s proposal, though I have reservations 
with regard to its likely cost and the bureaucratic burden it could impose. Nevertheless, 
bearing in mind JP’s commitment to the PCC and its Code, I am confident that the 
company will continue to support the principle of self regulation, though whether it 
will support all aspects of Lord Black’s proposals I do not know.”

7.10  A number of regional titles raised concerns about the cost, bureaucracy and other details of 
Lord Black’s proposals, generally pointing out that there was a need for more clarity and more 
negotiation. For example, Anne Pickles, Associate Editor of Cumbrian News said:145

“so  far  as  I  am  able  to  do  so,  I’d  suggest  CN  would  not  immediately  be  ready  to 
commit to all the specifics of Lord Black’s proposals for self-regulation. That’s not to 
say they are dismissed as wholly inappropriate or unworkable. But they do beg more 
time for careful consideration and perhaps some amendment.”

Jonathan Russell, editor of the Glasgow Herald, was very supportive in principle but raised a 
number of concerns that would need to be resolved:146

“As  an  editor,  I  believe  the  publications  for  which  I  have  responsibility  are  ready 
and  committed  in  principle  to  entering  into  these  contractual  obligations,  subject 
to clarification of certain detail and any conclusions the Leveson Inquiry itself may 
reach. I also believe my view broadly reflects the attitude of Newsquest Media Group 
as a whole.”

And:147

“However, I do not see the system as fully developed in Lord Black’s proposals and I 
do think there will be the need for some mechanical adjustments here and there. On 
my reading of it, the framework leaves the Regulator to decide whether and what 
changes should be made, and then the Industry Funding Body has to approve them. 
It puts the publishers, locked into the endless contract, at the Regulator’s mercy if 
the system does not work smoothly from day one. In reality, I expect the Regulator 
will be sensitive to concerns of this kind and will listen to us. But I have to note the 
lack of an express provision for the members themselves to propose changes without 
actually having to terminate or threaten to terminate the contract: a safety-valve, if 
you like. There is also a concern over the extra workload which may be placed on the 
senior member of staff tasked with dealing with PCC issues. This cannot become more 
onerous than it currently is. On the other hand, I appreciate that the public need to 
see a strong Regulator in place, serving a set of established principles and who is not 
at the beck and call of the members. I think editors like myself have to accept that this 
is a leap of faith we have to make in order to win back the trust of the public.”

7.11  Lord Black did not seek to consult with those blogs currently outside of the PCC so it is no 
surprise that Paul Staines (Guido Fawkes) and Camilla Wright (Popbitch) indicated that they 
were  not  ready  to  join  the  system.  Nonetheless,  Ms  Wright’s  assessment  of  the  proposal 
offers some relevant insights into whether such a system would be likely to be welcomed by 
the new internet providers such as Popbitch:148

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF“The  proposal  set  out  by  Lord  Black  is  undoubtedly  a  well-meaning  attempt  to 
provide a basis under which the major newspaper publishers, who have seemingly 
on occasions ignored the already established PCC code when it suited (thus creating 
the culture, practices and ethics for which this Inquiry was established to investigate), 
might be persuaded to follow their own code.
As such, the proposal appears to be written by and for the vested interests of the 
newspaper business. It appears to have almost no relevance to editors of independent 
web publishers such as myself.
Being asked, as an obvious outsider to the national newspaper industry, to sign up to 
a contract whose architects and principal beneficiaries were the same media bosses 
in this gentleman’s club, undoubtedly has limited appeal. The composition of the trust 
board and complaints committee would appear to be drawn from, and relevant to, 
national newspapers rather than digital media.” 

What difference would these proposals make?

7.12  The  Inquiry  also  sought  the  views  of  editors  on  what  specific  differences  membership  of 
a system of the kind set out by Lord Black, underpinned by contractual obligations, would 
make to the culture, practices and ethics of their publications. The responses are informative. 
Among the national titles, only James Harding149 and John Witherow150 from The Times and 
The Sunday Times, Chris Blackhurst151 from The Independent and Lloyd Embley152 from Trinity 
Mirror, indicated that procedural changes would be required. Not a single editor indicated 
that the changes would have the effect of raising standards in respect of their own publication 
and most said that there would be no practical effect whatsoever: 

“In my first witness statement, I explained the basis upon which The Daily Express 
operates. In light of those matters, I do not think that joining a system such as that 
described in the Proposals would make any significant difference to how The Daily 
Express is run.” 153
“I would not expect that membership of a system based on contractual obligations 
would have a material impact on the running of the Daily Star newspaper.” 154
“As the editor of The Daily Telegraph, while there will be new requirements placed 
upon us, I do not envisage that the existence of a new self-regulatory system will have 
much practical impact upon the publication.” 155
“I would anticipate generally that there would be a continuation of the changes to 
the culture, practices and ethics that have been occurring at newspapers over the 
past five to six years.” 156

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKConsequently, we do not consider that the culture, practice and ethics of our journalism 
would be significantly altered by membership of the kind of system proposed by Lord 
Black.” 157
“We do not foresee membership of this system altering our approach to any great 
extent, That said, we would work with the new regulator to ensure that our approach 
is entirely aligned with their standards and processes” 158
“Lord  Black’s  proposals  complement  new  governance  that  News  International  has 
already introduced.” 159
“I  do  not  therefore  believe  that  Lord  Black’s  proposals,  if  implemented,  will  have 
any effect whatsoever on the quality of the FT’s journalism or the culture of the FT’s 
newsroom.” 160

7.13  The  message  was  essentially  the  same  from  the  editors  of  the  non-national  press  and 

magazines who provided evidence on this question:

“If JP were to agree to Lord Black’s proposals, I am confident that compliance with 
them would make little practical difference to the way my staff and I operate.” 161
“Membership of a system of the kind set out by Lord Black, underpinned by contractual 
obligations, would do little - if anything - to alter the culture, practices and ethics of 
Cumbrian Newspapers.” 162
“If it were to be implemented, we do not consider that the system envisaged by Lord 
Black will have any effect at all on the current culture, practices and ethics of our 
respective newspapers.” 163
“In terms of the stories we carry and the way we go about our work, Lord Black’s 
proposals would make little difference to us…..” 164
“Notwithstanding the reservations I have in respect of the Proposals as they currently 
stand, I do not think that ’there would be any particular differences in the way OK! 
Magazine is run if such a system were to be introduced.” 165

7.14  Having said that, some responses did emphasise that changed processes would be required:

“One clear area of change would be within our administration. All correspondence 
with statutory bodies, members of the public and the courts concerning complaints 
are carefully filed. However in honesty our systems for recording the route of decision 
making over particular stories would have to be improved in order to satisfy the the 
(sic) demands of an annual audit, I do not think this would take much.” 166

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF“Therefore,  I  believe  that  any  specific  difference  would  be  more  about  further 
strengthening the current practices at my publications, and the checks that are already 
in place (such as the need to verify any potentially contentious stories with at least 
two independent sources and to seek advice from the legal team as necessary). It is 
also likely to make the journalists more aware of the consequences of not complying, 
I believe that any such changes will only make a publication stronger.” 167
“Insofar  as  PressBofs  submission  may  though  require  us  to  collect  and  store 
information  on  stories  that  we  might  be  asked  to  justify  at  a  later  date,  whereas 
currently  we  may  have  discussions  about  these  types  of  stories,  under  PressBofs 
proposals we would likely have to note conversations and decisions made regarding 
these types of stories.” 168
“None,  other  than  in  terms  of  the  additional  paperwork  required  under  the  new 
regime, for example, in terms of annual returns to the regulator. The bureaucratic 
burden would not be an insuperable objection to participation in a new scheme. The 
underlying culture, practices and ethics would, most likely, remain the same.” 169

7.15  The only response that suggested that any substantive change would be required was that 

from Paul Staines, who runs the Guido Fawkes blog, who said:170

“It would bog us down in bureaucracy by opening a channel for politically motivated 
nuisance  complainants.  Every  single  article  we  write  that  voices  an  opinion  is 
challenged  by  our  readers  in  the  comments,  on  Twitter  and  via  email.  If  we  were 
obliged  to  respond  to  complainants  we  would  be  overwhelmed.  It  is  ridiculously 
impractical given the volume of specious complaints.” 

Not all blogs took the same line. Camilla Wright, editor of Popbitch, said that “it would be 
unlikely to have much effect.” 171

7.16 

It is difficult, in the light of these comments, to conclude that the press themselves believe 
that the system proposed by Lord Black would drive up standards. It is true that, in all cases, 
it is said that there would be no impact from the proposals because the relevant title already 
respects the PCC standards. However, in the light of the practices that have been identified by 
the Inquiry this view, at least in some parts of the press, must display a degree of complacency 
that argues against the prospect of real change under the proposed system.

8.	 Summary	and	conclusions
8.1 

The proposal put forward by Lord Black does represent a significant improvement on the PCC 
as currently constituted and I recognise and appreciate the efforts that he and others have 
gone to in order to be able to present this proposal in such detail to the Inquiry. However, this 
proposal does not, in its current form, meet any of the criteria that I set out in May.

8.8 

I have repeatedly made it clear that in order to be considered effective a new regulatory 
regime  would  have  to  work  for  the  public  as  well  as  for  the  industry.  That  means  that, 
besides promoting the highest professional standards of journalism and the importance in a 
democratic society of free speech and freedom of expression, a new regulatory regime must 
cover all significant publishers; it must also be capable of raising standards while at the same 
time protecting both the public interest and the rights of individuals. This proposal fails to 
meet the requirement for effectiveness on two of those points. 

First,  the  proposed  contractual  basis  has  some  benefit  in  keeping  publishers  within  the 
system for a period of time once they have signed up. However, it does nothing to require 
them to sign up and the evidence before the Inquiry makes it clear that there is a substantial 
distance to go before all significant publishers could be persuaded to join the system. In those 
circumstances it is not possible to say with any confidence that this proposal would have 
sufficient coverage within the industry. Furthermore, I realistically have to identify that the 
main incentive to any publisher to sign up to this system is the threat that the Inquiry will 
recommend some form of regulation that is less to their taste. Once this Report has been 
published, that power to bring publishers to the table will no longer exist, so to the extent 
that publishers have not yet signed contracts there can be no reliance on them ever doing so.

Even  if  all  significant  publishers  were  to  join  this  proposed  contractual  system  there  is 
no  guarantee  that  the  system  would  continue  to  operate,  or  to  operate  at  the  standards 
currently proposed, beyond the first five year period. In addition, titles may leave the system 
if  ownership  is  transferred  to  a  non-member.  This  does  not  provide  sufficient  long  term 
stability or durability.

A  number  of  incentives  have  been  proposed  to  entice  publishers  into  the  system  and  to 
keep them there. Unfortunately those incentives are very weak and it is difficult to see them 
having any impact on a publisher who does not in any case consider membership to be in his 
interest.

Second,  the  proposal  is  structured  entirely  around  the  interests  and  rights  of  the  press, 
with no explicit recognition of the rights of individuals. The system gives no rights at all to 
complainants  and  the  regulator  is  set  up  without  any  remit  to  protect  the  rights  of  third 
parties.  At  its  heart,  an  effective  regulator  should  have  the  interests  of  those  likely  to  be 
affected, alongside the interests of freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.

A new system must have an independent process for setting fair and objective standards. 
In my opinion, this proposal fails to meet that test by leaving the setting of standards in the 
hands of the industry, albeit with a check by the Trust Board. A relatively small change to the 
proposal, making it clear that the Code Committee is advisory and that the Trust Board is 
responsible for establishing and altering the code, would go a considerable way to deal with 
this concern.

A  new  system  must  have  an  independent  enforcement  and  compliance  mechanism.  This 
proposal  makes  real  advances  under  this  heading.  I  welcome  the  emphasis  on  improving 
internal  governance  within  publishers.  I  support  the  proposal  that  complaints  should  be 
dealt with in the first instance by publishers. I endorse both the requirement for an annual 
return on compliance to the regulatory body and a named senior individual within each title 
with responsibility for compliance and standards. These are real innovations and are very 
welcome. However, the proposal still has serving editors on the body making decisions on 
complaints and this does not provide the required degree of independence of enforcement. 

1649

KChapter 3 | Analysis of the Model Proposed by the PCC and PressBoF8.9 

I welcome the proposal for a standards and compliance arm, with both its ongoing monitoring 
role and its ability to carry out investigations. Again, these are both real innovations and are 
much needed. However, there are substantive concerns about the ability of this part of the 
organisation to function effectively given the procedural arrangements proposed. I am sure 
that this could be resolved by addressing the procedural issues, but they are not insignificant 
and it would be important to have an independent review of the operation of the standards 
arm after a short period, say a year, to ensure that they had been addressed effectively and 
to consider the possibility of making further procedural changes if they were needed.

8.10  Overall, however, I have serious reservations about the independence of the appointment 
process for the Chair of the Trust, and about the role of the Industry Funding Body throughout 
this model. I believe that sufficient independence cannot be achieved while the industry has 
a veto on the appointment of the Chair, has the right to define the standards and has the right 
to define the sanctions available. All these concerns could be remedied by reducing the IFB’s 
role in the operation of the proposal.

8.11  A new system must have the ability to offer meaningful remedies of correction and apology 
to  those  who  have  been  harmed  and  to  apply  effective  sanctions  to  those  who  continue 
to  breach  standards  (or  fail  to  comply  with  directions  as  to  correction  and  apology).  The 
remedies offered to individuals under the proposed system are exactly the same as those 
currently offered by the PCC, albeit with some potential improvements in transparency. This 
does not seem to me to be sufficient. The regulator should have the power to determine the 
prominence and  placing  of an apology, correction or adjudication  and  all  breaches of the 
code should be identified and recorded as such, even where the publisher cooperates with a 
mediated settlement. 

8.12  As has been made clear earlier, the creation of the investigations process is to be welcomed, 
and both the investigatory powers and the range of the sanctions available do look to be 
potentially effective if publishers cooperate. I repeat, however, that this process cannot be 
effective if it is prevented from operating by oppressive procedures; changes therefore need 
to be made to ensure that this does not arise, even where a publisher might try to frustrate 
the process.

8.13  An effective regulatory system must be adequately financed and have sufficient independence 
from its funding body to operate independently. I have significant concerns on both those 
fronts in relation to this proposal. First, the sums proposed both for core funding and for the 
enforcement fund look tight. This is particularly the case in relation to the enforcement fund 
which could easily be used up on investigations into a recalcitrant publisher. Second, the role 
of the Industry Funding Body throughout the proposal and the fact that the funding will not 
be settled in advance for the full contract period, give far too much influence to the IFB. It 
is welcome that the industry is keen to fund this regulatory regime itself without input from 
the taxpayer or from complainants; however, the extent to which the largest players must 
shoulder the bulk of the burden of the cost for the good of the industry as a whole, along with 
the extent to which the funding mechanism should be open and transparent, are also issues 
which would have to be addressed.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKChapter 4

inquiry

1.	
1.1 

Introduction
Chapter 2 above described the proposal that has been put to the Inquiry by Lord Black, as 
Chairman of PressBof, on behalf of the industry. There have been some 45 other proposals for 
complete or partial regulatory regimes submitted to the Inquiry and many more submissions 
with ideas and comments on the way forward. I am very grateful to all those who have taken 
the  time  and  gone  to  considerable  trouble  to  offer  their  assistance  to  the  Inquiry  in  this 
way. Whilst some of these proposals are complete in themselves, I intend to consider all the 
elements of a regulatory regime that have been put forward, rather than to describe each 
model as presented. All of the submissions are part of the evidential record of the Inquiry and 
can be seen in their entirety on the website. Rather than looking at each individual proposal 
for an entire answer it is more useful to look at the range of proposals made each of the issues 
covered, by way of building up a complete picture of the ideas that have been submitted.

2.  a new regulatory body
2.1 

All the proposals submitted have made two basic assumptions. First, that the Press Complaints 
Commission  (PCC)  as  currently  constituted  is  not  delivering  adequate  regulation  of  press 
standards and, second, that some form of new regulatory body is required. The first of those 
assumptions is important only in that it reinforces the conclusion I have already reached1 that 
leaving the current system unchanged is not a credible option.

2.2 

The second assumption, that a new press regulatory body is required, is more interesting 
and requires some examination. All those submitting proposals for the future envisage the 
establishment of a new body with responsibilities for press standards. These proposed bodies 
obviously differ significantly in their scope, authority and powers, but no one has suggested 
that press standards could be supported adequately though changes to the general law or 
through strengthening law enforcement. Neither has anyone suggested that improvements 
in internal governance in the press would, of themselves, be sufficient guarantee of adequate 
standards.

2.3 

This  does  not  mean  that  the  creation  of  a  new  press  standards  body  is  the  only  possible 
answer to the problems with press standards identified in this Report. It does, however, mean 
that I have not received evidence on potential alternative approaches.

3.	 Functions	and	structures
3.1 

A  variety  of  functions  for  a  new  press  standards  body  to  cover  have  been  put  forward. 
Essentially they fall into the categories below.

1 Part K, Chapter 2

1651

K3.2 

3.3 

3.4 

Setting standards
By ‘setting standards’ I broadly mean the establishment of a code of practice that sets the 
minimum  standards  to  which  relevant  organisations  are  expected  to  adhere  and  against 
which  their  conduct  should  be  judged.  Three  different  approaches  have  been  adopted  to 
standards setting. The first is that contained in the industry proposal, namely that the setting 
of standards should be essentially a matter for the industry, albeit with some lay input, and 
that it should sit outside of any body with responsibility for enforcing the standards. This 
position is put forward by Lord Black and supported by all publishers or editors who have 
commented on the issue. It is also the position supported by Lord Prescott’s working group.2

The second proposition is that standards setting should be the responsibility of an independent 
regulatory body that is also responsible for enforcement of the standards. This is the position 
put forward by the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom (CPBF),3 the Co-ordinating 
Committee on Media Reform,4 Ofcom,5 the Media Regulation Round Table6 and Professor Roy 
Greenslade.7

The third proposition, only explicitly put forward by Max Mosley,8 is that there should be 
separate independent bodies which set the standards and enforce them. This would allow 
for statutory enforcement of press standards without the standards themselves being set by 
a statutory body. A joint submission on behalf of the Core Participant Victims (CPVs) argues 
for separate mechanisms for rule making, adjudication and investigations, but is not specific 
in terms of whether this means separate bodies.9

Promotion and enforcement of standards

3.5  Where the issue is addressed specifically, all the proposals submitted envisage a new press 
standards body having a broad regulatory role involving the promotion and enforcement of 
standards. This is often described as requiring investigative powers.

3.6 

Complaints handling
All the proposals submitted envisage that some part of their proposed regulatory structure 
would have the responsibility to hear complaints about breaches of a press standards code. 
In most cases the proposals are not specific about the degree of relationship between the 
more general standards enforcement role and the complaints handling role. In the case of the 
industry proposal, it is quite clear that it is envisaged that both are done by the same body, 
albeit by different parts of that body. The British and Irish Ombudsman Association was clear

set the standards and the body that enforced standards more generally (although they made 
no comments on whether those two roles should be separate).10

Championing freedom of expression
Some  proposals  explicitly  recommend  a  role  for  the  press  standards  body  in  acting  as  a 
champion for freedom of expression or the freedom of the press.11 The National Union of 
Journalists  (NUJ)  says  that  the  primary  duty  of  a  new  press  standards  body  should  be  to 
ensure the freedom of the press from both the state and editors and owners.12 The Media 
Regulation  Roundtable  sets  out  two  objectives  for  their  proposed  new  Media  Standards 
Authority, one of which is:13

“To  promote  and  protect  the  right  of  the  media  to  publish  information  on  public 
interest matters and the right of the public to receive it by promoting and protecting 
public  interest  journalism  in  all  its  forms  and  by  protecting  and  encouraging  high 
standards of ethical and responsible journalism.”

Adjudication of civil claims
Adjudication of civil claims is considered as essential in a number of proposals. Specifically, 
Early Resolution, the Alternative Libel Project and Max Mosley build their proposals around  
the  provision  of  dispute  resolution  procedures.  The  Early  Resolution  proposal  suggests  a  
statutory basis for the regulator and the adjudication process, ensuring that all relevant claims 
are dealt with though this means.14 Similarly, Mr Mosley proposes a structure based around  
a  statutory  tribunal  with  authority  over  all  printed  press,  its  agencies  and  the  internet.15 
By  contrast  the  Alternative  Libel  Project  and  the  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  suggest 
that access to a cheap, fast and fair way of resolving defamation claims would be a strong 
incentive to publishers to join a voluntary regulation system.16 The CPVs argue that the regime 
should oversee issues covering libel, privacy and harassment (as well as broader standards 
concerning accuracy, publishing and information gathering) but do not present any specific 
proposals as to how that should be done.17

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry K3.9 

Pre-publication functions
Few of the proposals address the question of whether the press standards body should have 
any functions prior to publication. Early Resolution recommends that the issue of advisory 
‘desist notices’, to deter actual or threatened media misconduct, is an important function.18 
The Media Regulation Roundtable proposes a specific role for the media standards body of 
providing pre-publication advice, including being able to request a publisher to demonstrate 
evidence  of  an  appropriate  public  interest  prior  to  publication  of  material  that  invades 
an  individual’s  privacy.19  This  approach  was  strongly  criticised  by  Sir  Charles  Gray  of  Early 
Resolution,20 who argued that involvement of a standards body prior to publication in that 
way would constitute an interference with the freedom of the press.

Roles for other bodies

3.10  George  Eustice  MP,  in  his  proposal,  suggested  additional  roles  for  bodies  other  than  the 
proposed press standards body. Specifically, he suggests that Ofcom should have a role in 
ensuring adequate governance within press organisations. He does not suggest that Ofcom 
should have any role in dealing with disputes about individual news stories,21 but does suggest 
a right of appeal to the Information Commissioner in respect of privacy cases. He proposes 
that this right to appeal should apply in respect of all media, irrespective of whether they 
were participants in any system of voluntary regulation.22 This is perhaps best considered in 
relation to the suggestions for reform of the Data Protection Act elsewhere in the Report.23

3.11  A  different  approach  was  put  forward  by  the  Media  Standards  Trust  (MST)  and  the 
communications  consultant  Tim  Suter.  Both  proposed  a  system  based  around  a  statutory 
oversight  body  that  would  have  the  role  of  approving  self-regulatory  bodies.  Under  this 
approach the focus is not on the functions of the self-regulatory body itself, but the minimum 
requirements that such a self-regulatory body should have to meet. Under the MST model 
the oversight body would only approve bodies that meet:

(a)  minimum commitments within a code of practice;
(b)  basic requirements of a contract of membership, including sanctions;
(c) 
(d) 

adequate independence; and
adequate  governance  arrangements  with  regard  to  proportionality,  accountability, 
consistence, transparency and targeting.24

3.12  Under Mr Suter’s proposal the oversight body (which in his case is the Ofcom Content Board) 

would have to satisfy themselves as to:25

governance  arrangements  guaranteeing  independence  from  both  Government  and 
industry;
adequate regulatory scope, industry coverage and powers; and
adequate operational and funding arrangements.

3.13  The oversight body would establish basic rules around independence and effectiveness but 
the rest would be for the self-regulatory body, which would have at least the standards setting 
and complaints roles otherwise described.

3.14  Under  this  approach  the  oversight  body  would  have  significant  powers  to  determine  the 
regulatory framework, but no regulatory powers over press organisations themselves. The 
effect of an oversight body withholding its approval from a self-regulatory body, or of a press 
organisation  refusing  to  join  an  approved  self-regulatory  body,  is  a  key  point  under  these 
proposals and is considered later in this chapter.

4.  should coverage be voluntary or mandatory?
4.1 

The proposals submitted to the Inquiry are split on whether compliance with press standards 
that go beyond the existing criminal and civil law should be voluntary or mandatory. Those 
arguing that regulation or adherence to standards should be voluntary offer four reasons as 
to why. First, there is an argument that any form of mandatory regulation of press standards 
is an infringement of the freedom of the press. Lord Prescott warns that a mandatory system 
risks turning into, or being perceived as, a state licensing system.26 Paul Dacre said that he 
feared any Parliamentary involvement would be the ‘thin end of the wedge’.27 Similarly, Lord 
Hunt has expressed strong reservations about the risks to freedom of the press should any 
measure relating to regulation of the press come before Parliament.28 Lord Black argues that 
any form of statutory intervention would inevitably undermine the “constitutional principle” 
of independence.29 Ed Richards was clear that a licensing regime, such as that which Ofcom 
operates  in  respect  of  broadcasting,  would  not  be  an  appropriate  model  for  the  press 
because:30

“freedom of expression works in a different way, and a more unqualified way, for the 
press.”

The Media Regulation Roundtable asserts that compulsory regulation would have to be 
backed by compulsory registration and that this might be difficult to justify under Article 
10(2) of the ECHR.31 Hugh Tomlinson QC said that regulation of the print media could, in 
some circumstances be compatible with the ECHR, particularly if limited, for example, to a 
set of mandatory standards for publications with a large circulation, but that general regula-

tion which might amount to a licensing regime would not.32

Second, it is argued that the effectiveness of a standards regime depends on the active support 
of the participants, that a mandatory scheme would not have the support of those compelled 
to comply and consequently would not be as effective as a voluntary system could be.33 Mr 
Richards  pointed  out  that  for  self-regulation  to  be  effective  it  requires  ‘genuinely  willing 
participants’ in the enterprise. The point was also made by Ofcom that self-regulation is most 
likely to be effective where there is a strong alignment between the industry interest and the 
public interest,34 leading to the conclusion that active support could best be secured by the 
right range of incentives within a self-regulatory system. The Media Regulation Roundtable 
argued that a voluntary system would be designed to obtain the fullest cooperation of the 
media; as a result, it would be more likely to command support and be effective in practice.35

Third,  it  is  argued  that  there  are  numerous  practical  difficulties  with  making  a  system 
mandatory. Any mandatory system would require some form of legislation; it is argued that 
this would make the resultant system inflexible and unable to move to react to changes in 
the market or in technology.36 As an example, Lord Black points out that the broadcasting 
complaints regime is governed by the Communications Act 2003, which doesn’t even mention 
the internet.37

Finally, issues have been raised about for whom any such regulation or standards would be 
mandatory. Specifically there are concerns about the ability of legislation to identify relevant 
online  providers  in  a  world  where  anyone  might  contribute  to  news  and  current  affairs 
discussion online, via Twitter or blogs, alongside big news providers (including newspaper 
websites).38 There are obvious difficulties about seeking to apply regulation to providers of 
internet services that are not based in the UK.39 Equally there might be a risk of any providers 
moving out of the UK in order to avoid mandatory standards regulation.40

Generally, even where there is strong support for a voluntary system, those proposing such 
systems are keen for all news providers, particularly all national newspapers, to be part of 
the system. Lord Hunt said that the industry’s proposed voluntary scheme would be ‘fatally 
undermined’ if a big fish, such as Northern and Shell, were to escape the net.41 Accordingly, 
all of the proposals that rely on voluntary membership of a press standards body also stress

the  need  for  appropriate  incentives  to  ensure  universal  membership  of  relevant  news 
organisations. The range of incentives proposed is considered in more detail in below.42

By contrast, those arguing for a mandatory standards regime simply point to the failure of 
the voluntary self-regulatory approach over the last century and, in particular, the difficulty of 
ensuring that all relevant publications comply with any voluntary regime. Separate issues are 
also raised about the ability to require both claimants and defendants to use an alternative 
dispute  resolution  mechanism.  However,  whilst  the  rationale  for  making  some  form  of 
standards regulation compulsory is common to a number of proposals, the concept of what 
might be made compulsory differs widely between them. Whether some form of mandatory 
standards regulation amounts to a form of licensing will depend heavily on the consequences 
of non-compliance. The following paragraphs briefly outline both the mandatory elements of 
proposals and the proposed consequences of non-compliance.

The  CPVs  argue  that  all  newspapers  and  magazines  should  fall  within  the  jurisdiction  of 
the  regulatory  regime  and  comply  with  the  requirements  of  adverse  adjudications  or 
investigations.43  This  appears  to  be  an  argument  for  compulsory  coverage  by  implication, 
rather than specifically stated as such.

Sir  Louis  Blom-Cooper  QC  recommends  mandatory  coverage  for  a  Standards  Commission 
that would adjudicate on complaints as well as having investigatory powers and a role to 
promote freedom of expression. However, the only sanction underpinning the mandatory 
standards would be its own publication of its critical verdicts.44 This is a proposal that enhances 
transparency around the standards applied by the press but would not be regulation in any 
usual sense.

The Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom (CPBF) outlines proposals for a body that 
would have the power to adjudicate on breaches of its code of ethics and order the wording 
and  placement  of  publication  of  apologies  and  retractions.  This  would  be  enforceable  by 
a court and the CPBF suggest that, where a publication is outside of UK jurisdiction, then 
distribution  could  be  suspended  until  ‘the  matter  is  resolved’.45  This  approach  limits  the 
mandatory nature of regulation to the publication of apologies and retractions, but is silent 
on what might happen if a publication refused to comply with a direction or a court order 
enforcing it. In a submission on behalf of the Labour Party, Harriet Harman QC MP makes 
a similar suggestion, emphasising that the important element is the ability of the body to 
enforce its decisions across all newspapers. In Ms Harman’s model the courts would be able 
to fine the newspapers if they failed to comply with an order of the body.46

4.10  Mr Eustice challenges the idea that statutory regulation of any sort would have a chilling effect 
on freedom of expression, pointing to the substantial statutory regulation of broadcasting, 
whilst underlining that broadcasting is home to ‘some of the best investigative journalism in 
Britain’.47 The statutory provision he envisages is a role for Ofcom in overseeing governance 
standards  in  the  press,  with  no  involvement  in  day  to  day  disputes  on  individual  stories,

to  breaches  of  privacy.  He  does  not  set  out  what  the  consequences  might  be  for  a  press 
organisation which refused to comply with either element of statutory regulation.48

4.11  Early  Resolution  propose  a  system  of  mandatory  regulation  that  requires  media  disputes 
that would otherwise have gone to the courts to be subject to a statutory dispute resolution 
scheme.49  Although  not  spelt  out,  the  decisions  of  the  dispute  resolution  body  would  be 
enforceable  by  the  courts.  Mr  Mosley  proposes  a  similar  scheme,  but  with  the  proposed 
tribunal having powers to investigate and adjudicate on any breach of the rules established 
by  an  independent  Press  Commission.  The  decisions  of  the  tribunal  would  be  able  to  be 
appealed  to  the  High  Court  and  decisions  of  the  tribunal  would  be  enforced  by  the  High 
Court.50

4.12  The  NUJ  proposes  a  statutory  regulatory  body  with  jurisdiction  over  all  publications  of  a 
certain size and their associated websites. Various options are suggested for the size trigger. 
The regulatory body would have the power to impose fines for breaches of standards as well 
as to order the publication of corrections and apologies in respect of the publications over 
which it had jurisdiction.51 The NUJ does not elaborate on the consequences of failure to 
comply with an order of the body.

4.13  Professor Greenslade concludes that there has to be some form of compulsion for the larger 
publishers but he would rely on a system of incentives for smaller and online publications.52 
The body would adjudicate on complaints and be able to order publication of an adjudication.53 
Professor Greenslade does not elaborate on what the consequences would be of a larger 
publisher failing to comply with an order from the body.

4.14  As already mentioned, Mr Suter and the MST each propose a statutory requirement that media 
organisations should belong to an approved self-regulatory body. Under the MST proposal 
the statute would apply only to big media companies, and would require internal governance 
standards in individual companies and membership of an approved self regulatory body.54 
Failure to do either could result in a fine enforced, if necessary, by the courts.55 The powers of 
the self-regulatory body in respect of breaches of standards would be a matter for the body 
itself; this would be by agreement with its members, as long as it could satisfy the backstop 
regulator that it was sufficiently robust.

4.15  Under  Mr  Suter’s  proposal  there  would  be  a  general  authorisation  regime,  which  would 
allow anyone to publish but would require them to do so in a way which met any regulatory 
requirements set down. Ofcom would define the characteristics of media services that should 
be regulated, including with reference to the size of the undertaking. Those services falling 
with the definition would have to join an approved self-regulatory body. The Ofcom Content 
Board  would  then  be  responsible  for  approving  self-regulatory  bodies,  in  line  with  the

would be free to define their own codes and sanctions, but would need to satisfy the Content 
Board  that  they  had  adequate  governance  arrangements,  scope,  coverage  and  powers  in 
order to be approved. Any organisation falling within the characteristics defined by Ofcom 
but refusing to join a relevant self-regulatory body would be regulated directly by Ofcom, 
using the self-regulatory code considered by the Content Board to be most appropriate.57 Mr 
Suter does not say so in terms, but the ultimate sanction in a general authorisation regime is 
withdrawal of authorisation to carry out the regulated activity.

Incentives	for	membership
As  described  above,58  where  compliance  with  press  standards  is  proposed  as  a  voluntary 
matter there is considerable desire to craft incentives that would encourage publishers to join 
a voluntary standards organisation. A number of potential incentives have been set out in the 
proposals submitted to the Inquiry and they are considered here.

Kitemarking
Kitemarking is the most straightforward of the incentives proposed. The issuing of a kitemark 
would rest solely with the regulatory body and no cooperation from outside the industry 
is required. A kitemark would stand as a symbol of the quality of a publication in terms of 
its adherence to the professional and ethical standards set out in the code of practice. The 
commercial value of the kitemark would be wholly dependent on the extent to which the 
purchasing  or  reading  public  were  aware  of  its  existence,  and  of  what  it  meant,  and  the 
extent to which that affected purchasing decisions. Essentially a kitemark has no value unless 
a product carrying it succeeds better in the market than a competing product without it.

5.3  Mr Dacre suggested that a kitemark would be effective. It would signal to the public which 
publications had signed up to self regulation and as such would provide an incentive not only 
to newspapers but also to internet news providers to join the system.59 The Media Regulation 
Roundtable suggested that a kitemark might be of particular value to smaller publishers and 
bloggers.60 Lord Hunt told the Inquiry that he thought publishers would carry a kitemark with 
pride. He accepted that there would always be some publications which might take equal 
pride in not carrying the badge and signalling themselves as outside the system, but he felt 
that it was important to make adherence to the new regime more visible.61

5.4 

I suspect that, while a kitemark might be seen as a benefit by some publishers, it is unlikely to 
have a significant impact in persuading publishers who do not otherwise want to join a self-
regulatory standards regime to do so.

VAT zero-rating
An idea which was much discussed during the early months of the Inquiry was the possibility 
of removing the VAT zero-rating for publications that were not members of a self-regulatory 
scheme.  Given  the  currency  this  idea  gained,  it  has  been  considered  in  depth  and  it  is 
important that that the issues are set out. The essential background is that printed material 
is zero-rated for VAT purposes, that is to say, no VAT is charged or payable. It is an important 
point that this is not an exemption from VAT. The proposition is that a newspaper that is not 
signed up to a self-regulatory standards regime should, instead, have VAT levied on it at the 
standard rate (currently 20% in the UK).

John Evans, Deputy Director in the Solicitor’s Office at HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC), 
with responsibility for advising on legal issues relating to VAT, has provided the Inquiry with 
expert evidence relating to this proposal.62 He explains that VAT is a European tax, and that 
one of the intentions of the EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EC is to ensure that the application 
of VAT does not distort competition, whether at national or community level.63 VAT is a tax 
on the final consumer, not the business. The effect of standard rating newspapers supplied 
by publishers outside the self-regulatory system would, in fact, be an increase in price for 
the consumers, or a squeeze on profit margins for the publishers, depending on how the 
publisher chose to manage his pricing.64 Either would have an impact on competition; indeed, 
that would be the point of the proposals, since the aim is to provide a strong commercial 
incentive on the publisher to join the self-regulatory regime.

The UK does not generally have the ability to determine which products are subject to VAT and 
which are not. There is no general discretion available to Member States to apply or dis-apply 
VAT to a particular product or service. Under the Directive, and pending full harmonisation 
of VAT, Member States have been permitted to, amongst other things, maintain some zero-
rates.65  The  zero-rate  applied  to  printed  matter  (including  newspapers  and  magazines)  is 
one of those. The UK does have discretion to remove those zero-rates and apply VAT at the 
standard rate to those products or services.66 However, once a zero-rate has been withdrawn 
it cannot be reinstated.67

All  UK  application  of  VAT  must  be  consistent  with  the  principle  of  fiscal  neutrality,  which 
precludes  treating  similar  goods  differently  for  VAT  purposes.68  It  follows  that  in  order  to 
implement the proposal described above, one would have to be confident that a newspaper 
published by a publisher within the self-regulatory regime and a newspaper published by a 
publisher outside the self-regulatory regime were not ‘similar goods’.69 Mr Evans drew the 
attention of the Inquiry to a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)70 
in which the court had been very clear that different legal regimes or different systems for 
control  and  regulation  were  of  no  relevance  when  assessing  whether  or  not  supplies  of 
products  or  services  were  similar.71  Mr  Evans  also  drew  the  attention  of  the  Inquiry  to  a

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKfurther decision72 in which the CJEU had concluded that similar services could not be treated 
differently for VAT purposes simply because one was lawful and the other was not.73

5.9  Mr Evans told the Inquiry that, in the view of HMRC, the supply of newspapers was likely 
to be similar whether supplied by a member or by a non member of a self-regulating body. 
HMRC therefore considered that a challenge against the proposed change, either through the 
UK courts or by the EU commission, would be highly likely to be successful.74

5.10 

It is worth bearing in mind the provision noted at above,75 that once a zero-rate has been 
removed from a product or service the UK has no discretion to reinstate it. It follows that if 
the zero-rating were to be removed from newspapers outside of the self-regulatory regime, 
and that distinction was found by the CJEU to be a breach of fiscal neutrality, the UK would 
be unable to reinstate zero-rating for those newspapers outside the self-regulatory regime 
and would therefore be required to withdraw the zero-rating from all newspapers in order to 
preserve fiscal neutrality.76

5.11  Mr Evans made a number of other points about the proposal. If the proposal were successfully 
adopted, the decision over whether or not VAT were charged on a newspaper would effectively 
reside with the self-regulatory body. However, ultimately HMRC must be able to reach its 
own view on whether those decisions were being reached in a fair way, and HMRC and the 
Government could become involved in a legal challenge to a decision of the regulatory body. 
This  would  effectively give the Government a significant backstop role in decisions  of the 
regulator over who could join or remain a member of the system.77

5.12  There is also a risk that differential VAT treatment of newspapers inside the self-regulatory 
system could be considered to be a state aid. Unless such aid had been cleared in advance 
by  the  European  Commission  (and  the  likelihood  of  getting  such  clearance  would  require 
detailed consideration) the aid, in the form of the difference between the levels of VAT, would 
have to be paid back to HMRC by the newspaper publishers who had benefited from it.78 
Mr Evans also drew the attention of the Inquiry to potential risks that the proposal could 
constitute  a  barrier  to  freedom  of  establishment  under  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of 
the European Union,79 and that it could constitute an infringement of the right to freedom 
of expression under the ECHR.80 Finally Mr Evans noted that there would be a potentially 
significant compliance cost for small businesses who sell newspapers, some of whom may 
have  to  register  for  VAT  where  they  were  not  already  so  registered,  and  in  being  able  to 
correctly identify which publications were subject to VAT and which were not.81

5.13 

It is noticeable that very few witnesses have supported this proposal during Module Four 
of the Inquiry. Professor Greenslade82 and Ofcom83 float it as an idea in their submissions,

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Kbut without any detailed explanations of how it might be possible. Ms Harman,84 and the 
Media Regulation Roundtable85 explicitly recognise that there may be insuperable barriers 
to this in European law. The MST looks at the issue in considerable detail and identifies that 
the current zero-rating of newspapers for VAT is worth nearly £400m collectively to national 
newspaper titles86 but recognises that, although the removal of VAT zero-rating as an incentive 
to join a self-regulator scheme is possible in theory, it would require considerable political 
will and would likely take some years to come into practice.87 I see this as a considerable 
understatement. The political will and the time required to overturn the principle of fiscal 
neutrality are, in my opinion, incalculable. Put simply, this is not a credible option.

Journalistic accreditation

5.14  Mr Dacre first raised the possibility that the provision of press cards to journalists could be 
restricted only to journalists working for publishers subscribing to the new regulatory body.88 
This proposal is one of the four potential incentives to membership of the industry proposal 
put forward by Lord Black, and is explained in basic terms in Chapter 3 above. The proposal 
has now been rejected by the UK Press Card Authority (UKPCA).

Access to industry services

5.15  There are a number of services, where the newspaper publishing industry works together, 
which, it has been suggested, could be withheld from those who do not join a self-regulatory 
press standards body. The first is access to Press Association (PA) copy. The PA is a private 
company,  with  27  shareholders,  most  of  whom  are  national  and  regional  newspaper 
publishers.89  It  is  the  main  multimedia  news  agency  in  the  UK  and  Ireland,  providing 
newspapers with access to its news content, as well as images, listings, sport and weather 
information.90 The proposal is that access to PA copy might be denied, or at least supplied on 
differential terms, to publishers who refuse to comply with a code of practice.91

5.16  Newspapers, both regionally and nationally rely heavily on PA wire copy for content. It is a 
fundamental resource, particularly with current business models, and a newspaper denied 
access  to  PA  services  would  have  to  find  an  alternative  source  for  such  material,  such  as 
producing its own foreign and national news content, or do without such information.92 Mr 
Dacre argues that denying access to news publishers to the PA service would be a ‘crushing 
blow’.93 The MST agrees that this would have a significant impact on publishers outside the 
system,  but  argues  that  restricting  it  would  be  undesirable  because  of  its  impact  on  the 
market.94

5.17  The second industry service it has been suggested could be denied to those outside a self-
regulatory system is coverage within the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC) and the National

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKReadership Survey. At present, ABC provides a vast range of media organisations, advertisers, 
academics and public members with data on circulation and web traffic. The data provided 
is used by the media owners and advertisers to calculate the value of advertising space. The 
ABC Board consists of members nominated by the trade bodies of both media owners (the 
NPA, the PPA, NS) and the advertising industry (Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) 
and  the  Incorporated  Society  of  British  Advertisers  (ISBA)).95  Whilst  ABC  is  the  dominant 
provider of this data, it is open to publishers to find other sources. The National Readership 
Survey is governed by the IPA, the NPA and the PPA and provides data for the size and nature 
of the audience reached in relation to over 250 newspapers and magazines.96

5.18  Professor  Greenslade  suggests  that  this  would  deny  such  publishers  the  ‘currency’  that 
advertisers use to buy space,97 thus having a potentially significant economic impact on them. 
The MST says that, whilst denial of access to both ABC and NRS figures would be likely to add 
to the costs of a publication, it seems unlikely to represent an overriding economic incentive 
for membership of a new regulatory system that may apply further costs to news publishers.98

5.19  The  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  notes  that  membership  of  collective  commercial 
partnerships such as participation in industry standards could offer a commercial incentive to 
join a self-regulatory standards body,99 but goes on to comment that, whilst incentives of this 
kind could be of some commercial value to publishers, they would not be strong enough to 
guarantee participation.100

5.20  The MST further argues that application of these incentives would be undesirable for two 
reasons. First, that it would concentrate power within the industry, and second that it would 
provide direct commercial benefits to publishers through their ability to restrict the business 
practices  of  existing  or  potential  rivals  and  could  thus  be  viewed  as  anticompetitive.101 
The  question  of  whether  these  incentives  might  give  rise  to  competition  law  problems  is 
considered above.102 I agree that this combination of incentives has the potential to make it 
very inconvenient for a major publisher to sit outside the self-regulatory regime. However, I 
also agree with the MST that this is essentially an economic calculation and that the extent to 
which they could actually encourage membership of the regime will depend on the costs of the 
impact of not being able to access these services together with the costs of compliance with 
the regime. Quite apart from the legal question of whether incentives such as these might be 
in breach of competition law, I  would also have some concerns about the potential impact on 
small businesses and bloggers for whom the costs of compliance might be disproportionate. 
It would also be essential that membership of the self-regulatory regime should be available 
on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to all who want to join if there are to be real 
commercial effects from being outside the regime.

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry KAssistance from the advertising industry

5.21  Lord Black suggests that there may be ways in which the advertising industry can help with 
building  incentives  for  membership  of  a  self-regulatory  standards  system.103  Ms  Harman 
suggests two specific ways in which this might be done, first by requiring publishers who 
are not members of the system to pay a levy on adverts carried and secondly by advertisers 
agreeing  to  withhold  advertising  from  publications  that  are  not  members.104  The  latter  is 
also hinted at by Mr Dacre.105 The levy concept has not been the subject of elaboration in 
evidence by anyone and, as such, is difficult to consider here. The concept that advertisers 
might withhold advertisements from non-member publications would require high levels of 
commitment from advertisers who, themselves, have nothing to gain from higher standards 
in the newspaper industry. The Inquiry has not been presented with any evidence to suggest 
that advertisers are ready to engage, or even contemplating engaging, in discussions around 
this. Furthermore, it is difficult to see what incentive there would be for the advertiser whose 
concern is to ensure that its product or the subject of its advertisements reaches the widest 
possible audience. Although this might be a powerful incentive if it could be put in place, I 
have seen nothing to suggest that it has any prospect of being adopted and see no reason 
why it should be.

Access to a dispute resolution mechanism

5.22  Many of the proposals present access to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism as an 
incentive to membership of a self-regulatory press standards system. Dispute resolution more 
generally is covered below. At this stage I am only concerned with its value as an incentive for, 
if it is to be seen as such, it must be something that is not available to non-members.

5.23  The  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  proposal  largely  centres  on  its  proposals  for  dispute 
resolution. Under this model, any complaint against a member organisation would go first 
to mediation by the regulatory body. If a complainant wished to start court proceedings in 
the case of a complaint of a legal wrong, then the court would stay the proceedings pending 
adjudication from the regulatory body’s tribunal. If mediation was unsuccessful then, where 
the complaint relates to a legal wrong, it would go to an adjudication process. This would 
provide a compulsory alternative dispute resolution mechanism that would have to be used 
by all complainants against members of the body, and all members of the body. If either party 
was unhappy with the result of the adjudication process they could, by agreement, go to the 
body’s Dispute Resolution Tribunal which would reach a conclusion binding on both parties. 
If the complainant was not happy with the result of the adjudication process it would still be 
open to him to pursue his complaint in court.106

5.24  This  would  serve  as  an  incentive  for  publishers  to  join  the  self-regulatory  standards  body 
because it would ensure that all legal challenges against them would go, in the first instance, 
through a fast, fair and cheap adjudication process, thus hopefully reducing their exposure to 
expensive and slow court proceedings. As set out, this proposal would not prevent individuals 
from exercising their right to have a court consider their case; however, they would have to

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKgo through an adjudication process first, and the court would be likely to take the result of 
the adjudication process into account when considering their case.

5.25  Sir Charles Gray (a retired High Court judge whose expertise is in media law) told the Inquiry 
about Early Resolution, a voluntary service providing dispute resolution in media matters. 
He made it clear that Early Resolution had not been as effective as they had hoped because, 
whilst it was very popular with publishers, it was meeting with resistance from claimants, 
possibly because of the incentives acting on those advising claimants.107 For this reason, Sir 
Charles had reached the conclusion that a voluntary ADR scheme would not be able to act as 
an incentive; it would have to be mandatory, and mandatory for everyone, thus excluding the 
possibility of using such a system as an incentive for membership.108

5.26  The Coordinating Committee for Media Reform (CCMR) proposed an approach under which 
complaints, including enforcement of civil rights, relating to those publishers that have signed 
up to the scheme would be dealt with through the fast track tribunal system.109 Angela Philips 
accepted that it would be unfair to citizens who would get treated differently depending on 
who has traduced them, but said it was a necessary price for a significant incentive.110

5.27  Lord Hunt raised the question of why the industry would agree voluntarily to subject itself 
to a cheap system of arbitration which would potentially open them up to claims brought 
by members of the public who could not afford to pursue legal redress. He also asked why 
wealthy  people  would  submit  voluntarily  to  arbitration  if  they  felt  they  might  be  able  to 
intimidate a publisher with threats of a full court hearing.111

5.28  Taking  a  different  view  to  Lord  Hunt  in  relation  to  the  industry,  Mr  Dacre  suggested  that 
access to swift and cheap resolution of defamation and privacy cases would be a major boon 
for both the industry and the public, and that it would be a huge incentive for a cost conscious 
publisher to sign up to a new regulatory system. Mr Dacre did not explain what he had in 
mind in any more detail but acknowledged that legislation would be required to deliver it.112 
Ms Harman suggests that damages might be capped for member organisations or be higher 
for non-member organisations, but goes on to recognise that it might not be acceptable for a 
victim to receive less compensation because they were libelled by an organisation belonging 
to a regulatory regime.

5.29 

I agree with Ms Harman on this latter point. I do not believe that damages should be assessed 
at different levels or that the press should be given additional legal protection if they are 
members of a regulatory system, because any injury suffered by a claimant is no less simply 
because the title has signed up to a regulatory regime to which it then does not adhere. But 
it may be that the title would be able to rely on its membership of a regulatory regime as 
demonstrating adherence to standards of behaviour, on the basis that a title that is not a 
member would have the rather more difficult burden of proving that it adhered to appropriate

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Kstandards. The Irish model has this type of provision and they believe that proof would be 
difficult  to  achieve.113  In  order  to  establish  the  incentive,  it  is  also  necessary  to  examine 
whether and, if so, how, claimants could be mandated or encouraged to use the ADR process.

Benefits in legal proceedings

5.30  A  number  of  the  proposals  put  before  the  Inquiry  suggest  that  a  publisher  should  be 
able  to  benefit  from  some  form  of  preferential  treatment  in  libel  proceedings  as  a  result 
of membership of a self-regulatory forum. In this context, the Irish Defamation Act and its 
provisions for recognition of the Press Council and Ombudsman are sometimes offered as 
an example.114 Dealing here only with the proposals that have been made for aspects of the 
scheme to be adopted in the UK, this section looks at the potential for the courts to treat 
defendants favourably because of voluntary participation in some form of regulation and the 
extent to which this would form an incentive to membership.

5.31  The  Alternative  Libel  Project  suggests  that  membership  of  a  self-regulatory  scheme  could 
be incentivised by costs orders made by the courts but offers no detail as to how that might 
work.115 Ofcom also refers to this suggestion, but goes further and suggests that the level of 
damages  might  also  be  affected  by  whether  a  self-regulatory  complaints  handling  system 
has  been  used.116  The  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  suggests  specifically  that  additional 
damages might be awarded against those who are not members of a self-regulatory system 
and  who  publish  defamatory  material  in  contravention  of  the  code  of  practice.  No  such 
additional  damages  could  be  awarded  against  a  member  of  the  system  even  where  they 
were in contravention of the code.117 The Media Regulation Roundtable also proposes a form 
of  statutory  support  for  those  wishing  to  bring  proceedings  against  publishers  outside  of 
the self-regulatory system, by allowing such proceedings to be brought with conditional fee 
arrangements.  In  addition,  costs  would  not  normally  be  recoverable  against  unsuccessful 
claimants.118

5.32 

It is possible to envisage a process by which costs might not be awarded even to a successful 
defendant where they were not a member of a credible self-regulatory system that offered 
access to ADR. With appropriate discretion in the court, that could potentially be extended to 
make the defendant responsible for all costs. It could also potentially extend to consideration 
of the costs implications of a claimant pursuing a title through the courts when there was a 
cheaper, faster ADR mechanism available because the publication was in a self-regulatory 
system which provided such access. Such an approach might be expected to encourage any 
publisher who felt they were at risk of defamation or privacy actions from those with very 
deep pockets to be a part of the self-regulatory system.

5.33 

It  is  less  clear  that  any  differentiation  could  (or  even  should)  be  applied  to  the  level  of 
damages. As identified above, I find it difficult to understand why it could ever be appropriate 
for the remedy offered by the courts to a victim of defamation or invasion of privacy to be 
affected  by  the  defendant’s  membership  or  otherwise  of  an  industry  body.  By  definition, 
having  succeeded  in  a  claim  for  damages,  the  relevant  publisher  will  have  failed  to  meet

mechanism might show disregard for standards (potentially justifying aggravated or exemplary 
damages) is another matter but I do not see how the compensatory award could be affected.

5.34  Lord  Prescott119  and  Ofcom120  go  further  than  considering  damages  and  refer  in  their 
submissions to the suggestion that access to certain defences in libel or defamation might be 
available to those who were part of a self-regulatory system. The essence of the proposal is 
that a defendant would be able to rely on compliance with a self-regulatory system and code 
of practice as evidence of responsible journalism and that this would constitute a defence. 
Professor Greenslade goes slightly further and suggests that a publisher standing outside of 
a self-regulatory system would be regarded as ‘failing to favour responsible journalism’.121

5.35  The  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  makes  specific  proposals  for  a  defence  of  ‘regulated 
publication,’ which would allow a defendant to rely on the fact that they had complied with 
directions or requirements of the self-regulatory authority in relation to the relevant published 
material. Similarly, it would be a sufficient defence in a privacy claim to demonstrate that the 
public interest requirements of the code had been complied with.122 In relation to the latter, 
however, it is again difficult to see why, as a matter of legal fairness, such a defence should 
not also be available to a non-regulated entity that claims to have equal or higher standards 
with which it complied (even though, in the absence of membership, that fact might be more 
difficult to prove).

New legal rights and remedies against non participants

5.36  The  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  proposes  the  introduction  of  a  statutory  right  of  reply 
or  correction,  with  appropriate  prominence.  These  would  be  available  only  in  respect  of 
publishers  who  were  not  members  of  the  self-regulatory  body.123  These  rights  would  be 
enforced by the courts. The effectiveness of the right to reply or correction as an incentive 
to membership of the self-regulatory body would depend on the relationship between the 
statutory right and the equivalent provisions in the self-regulatory code. If the statutory right 
is less onerous than the code provisions then it is unlikely to offer much of an incentive. If, on 
the other hand, the statutory provision were to be stronger than, or the same as, the code 
provision there might be some question as to the benefits to the public of the self-regulatory 
system. It is not entirely straightforward to see why publishers should effectively be able to 
opt out of a statutory obligation by joining a trade body that does not give equivalent public 
protection.

5.37  That is not the only problem with this idea. The critical features of a right of reply are its 
immediacy and its ready availability. It is difficult to see how providing a mechanism through 
the courts will achieve either of these objectives.

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry KExemption from ATVOD

5.38  One final incentive, suggested by the Media Regulation Roundtable,124 is that a press self-
regulatory body could take on the statutory responsibilities under the Audio Visual Media 
Services (AVMS) Directive for regulation of audio visual content published by its members. 
This would ensure that newspaper websites would be regulated by the self-regulatory body, 
rather than ATVOD as would now be the case if any of them were to fall to be regulated under 
the AVMS Directive. This would also be in line with the proposal from Jeremy Hunt MP, then 
the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport,125 in which he hypothesises a converged 
news regulator that would both provide self-regulation of the press and take on the statutory 
role required by the AVMS Directive, to ensure that the minimum standards laid down by the 
Directive are met.

5.39 

Effectiveness of incentives overall
In  any  voluntary  system  of  regulation  it  would  be  necessary  to  accept  that  some  of  the 
organisations  who  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  regulator  might  choose  to  sit  outside  the 
regulatory  regime.  If  staying  outside  the  regime  is  not  a  legal  possibility,  then  it  is  not  a 
voluntary  system.  It  is  common  ground  that,  in  order  to  be  effective,  any  new  system  of 
press standards should cover all the national newspapers and at least the main magazines 
and regional and local newspapers. If publishers are not to be compelled to join then there 
must be a reason why they would wish to do so. The question that needs to be addressed is 
whether a sufficient package of incentives can be crafted that makes it strongly in the interest 
of all publishers to be a part of a voluntary standards system, without actually compelling 
them to do so. In the absence of a sufficiently strong package of incentives, one must either 
accept a voluntary standards system that some publishers chose not to be a part of, or find a 
way of compelling, rather than incentivising, membership.

5.40  The possible incentives examined above are a comprehensive list of those that have been 
put to the Inquiry in evidence. There may well be others, but if there are I have not had them 
brought to my attention. I am satisfied that in kind, if not necessarily in detail, the list above 
includes all the obvious possible approaches to incentivisation (and some that are not so 
obvious).

5.41  Of  those  proposed,  I  can  see  merit  in  kitemarking.  There  are  clear  benefits  to  providing 
consumers  with  information,  though  no  evidence  has  been  presented  on  whether  a 
kitemark would have any effect on readers’ buying habits. Some publishers might be keen to 
demonstrate that they operate to the highest standards. On the other hand, no evidence has 
been presented to suggest that kitemarking would be anything other than a minor incentive 
and those least likely to want to join a voluntary press standards body are likely to be the least 
concerned to demonstrate their adherence to standards.

5.42  The  concept  of  a  package  of  commercial  benefits  from  membership  would  bear  further 
investigation. Any specific proposal would need to be tested against competition law. Even 
where limiting a commercial benefit to members of a voluntary standards body would be 
possible legally, it is not axiomatic that it would also be desirable. Any of these proposals 
would need to be looked at and evaluated in detail; this has not been possible because they 
have only been presented to the Inquiry in the most general of terms.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.43  The  benefits  to  publishers  of  an  ADR  regime  seem  obvious,  and  if  individuals  could  be 
compelled  to  use  such  a  regime  that  would  be  a  powerful  incentive.  However,  it  is  not 
possible to deprive individuals of their right to pursue or defend their rights in court and, on 
its own, any voluntary ADR mechanism is in my view unlikely to prove significantly compelling 
to publishers. I do not accept that it would be appropriate for differential damages to be 
awarded depending on the regulatory status of the defendant. However, there does seem to 
be real potential in constructing a costs regime in relation to privacy and libel cases that would 
make membership of a voluntary system a significant benefit to any publisher likely to face 
such challenges. Whether the benefit would be significant enough to encourage all national 
publishers into a voluntary system is impossible to forecast at this stage. Furthermore, if it 
is to be fully recognised within the costs regime operated by the courts, it would be highly 
desirable,  if  not  essential,  that  the  regulator  providing  the  ADR  mechanism  be  formally 
recognised and, thus, validated.

5.44 

I am satisfied that there is no realistic prospect of using the VAT zero-rating, or any other 
method of discrimination based on tax, as an incentive for membership of a press standards 
body. I conclude that restricting journalistic accreditation to members of a press standards 
body would be difficult and runs the risk of being a real threat to freedom of expression.

5.45  Ultimately, the one incentive that we have heard about that has been demonstrated to be 
effective is the realistic threat of press standards legislation if an adequate voluntary body 
with full coverage is not forthcoming. Professor John Horgan, the Irish Press Ombudsman, 
told the Inquiry that the creation of the Irish Press Council had been under consideration for 
decades before eventually significant political pressure for statutory regulation of the press 
made the industry focus:126

“Then in the middle 90s, after the collapse of a big newspaper group, the government 
set up a commission on the newspaper industry, of which I was a member, and which 
all major newspaper interests were also represented.

The report of that body recommended the establishment of a Press Ombudsman in 
1996. But nothing really happened after that. Nobody took ownership of it, and it 
wasn’t developed in any sense. Then after the 2002 general election, the then minister 
for justice, Michael McDowell, set up an expert group to make recommendations to 
him. And that expert group reported in 2003, recommending a statutory system of 
regulation for the press. I think it’s fair to say that that lit the fire under the topic 
in a way that it hadn’t been lit before, and the press industry realised that if this 
eventuality was to be avoided, they would have to come up with something that was 
credible, authoritative, independent and on all these fronts sufficiently acceptable to 
government, so the government would not proceed with its plans.

They  then  set  up  the  Press  Industry  Steering  Committee,  which  negotiated  and 
deliberated for some four years.”

And in a subsequent exchange he said: 127

“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But behind it all, do I gather from what you were saying 
somewhat earlier, was the threat of statutory regulation?
A. Absolutely.

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry KLORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So in other words, it behoved the press interests to come up 
with a solution that was less than the club that was being held over them?
A. That is absolutely the case. And in fact my membership, or our membership of the 
Alliance of Independent Press Councils of Europe indicates that in quite a few countries 
this  threat  has  been  the  engine  which  has  generated  or  promoted  the  successful 
establishment of press councils of the same kind in many European countries.
So  even  though  before  this  threat  was  made,  there  had  been  moves  towards  the 
establishment  of  something  like  this,  the  1996  report  of  the  commission,  which 
wasn’t under such a threat, recommended the establishment of an ombudsman. As 
I said, it was the real and present danger of that that created the situation in which 
we found ourselves.”

5.46  Similarly, Lara Fielden, in her comparative study of international press councils published by 

the Reuters’ Institute, says:128

“While..., the Press Councils considered here adopt many highly distinct approaches 
to  their  functions,  frameworks,  and  powers,  and  while  each  has  been  established 
against a very different historical, political, and cultural backdrop, a common theme 
emerges in the form of the galvanising effect of the threat of statutory intervention. 
A recognition of the importance of ethics and accountability, and debates between 
publishers  and journalists, may be significant. However the decisive trigger to the 
establishing,  or  reform,  of  a  Press  Council  is  commonly  a  proposal  for  statutory 
regulation  that  is  held  to  threaten  press  freedom  and  results  in  a  determined, 
pragmatic alternative response from the industry.”

5.47  This has also been broadly the case in the UK, as demonstrated in Part D, Chapter 1, where 
I note that there has been a pattern of the press undertaking to make changes when faced 
with  a  threat  of  legislation.  The  fact  that  these  promises  have  often  not  been  followed 
through with meaningful action may demonstrate that, in order to be effective in securing 
real industry action, the threat must be exceptionally credible; to date, that has not generally 
been the case in the UK.

5.48  Such a threat could be perceived to exist now and I have no doubt that the proposals put 
before me by Lord Black spring solely from the fear that I might recommend a legislative 
regulatory solution and that such a recommendation might be accepted by the Government. 
Indeed, Lord Black described the process of arriving at his proposals as a substantial one, 
leading to something completely different from anything that has gone before,129 going on to 
say:130

“That has only come about, I think, because of the opportunity that this Inquiry has 
given us to be able to analyse the things that have gone on in the past and see how 
we can try and rectify them for the future.”

5.49  Whilst it is no doubt true that the mere existence of this Inquiry has focussed minds, I do 
not think it is possible to rely on any perceived threat from the Inquiry itself to encourage 
publishers to join a self-regulatory system. Any such threat would have to be provided by the 
Government of the day and credibly represent a real intention to legislate quickly should an

effect was merely to postpone the issue until other more pressing political concerns took 
their place.

6.	 Statutory	recognition
6.1 

Even in an entirely voluntary self-regulatory system it might be considered desirable to have 
some form of statutory recognition for the purpose of encouraging or rewarding membership 
of,  and  compliance  with  the  standards  set  by,  the  voluntary  body.  This  is  perhaps  best 
illustrated by reference to the Irish Press Council, which is fully independent of Government 
and membership of which is entirely voluntary. An Irish Press Council could exist in any form, 
with  any  structure,  but  the  Defamation  Act  2009  in  Ireland  provides  for  a  defence  of  fair 
and reasonable publication,131 with the courts taking into account the extent to which the 
publisher has adhered to the standards set by the Press Council or, if the publisher is not a 
member of the Press Council, equivalent standards.132

6.2 

6.3 

Recognition of this sort would require the voluntary body to have some statutory existence. 
In  the  Irish  case,  the  Defamation  Act  includes  substantial  detail  on  the  composition 
and  appointment  of  the  Press  Council  and  the  appointment  and  procedures  of  the  Press 
Ombudsman,  but  only  a  few  overarching  points  about  the  existence  and  coverage  of  the 
standards  code.133  It  also  sets  out  the  process  for  recognition  of  the  Press  Council  by  the 
Parliament, once the Minister has satisfied himself that it meets the criteria set out in the 
Act.134

Lord Black’s proposed solution did not include any incentives that would require statutory 
recognition,  but  did  include  the  potential  to  include  an  ‘arbitral  arm’.  He  recognised  that 
the creation of an arbitration system of that sort would require changes to statute but was 
unclear precisely what sort of changes would be required.135 Lord Black was emphatic that 
he did not consider that any other area of statutory relationship was necessary or desirable 
in order to implement his proposal.136 Mr Dacre said that although the introduction of an 
arbitral arm would require changes to libel legislation it deserved the fullest support.137

6.4 

Lord Black was strongly of the view that any statutory involvement in press regulation would 
give rise to concerns about freedom of the press:138

“I’ve never seen a model of statute proposed which would not in some way invite the 
state into the regulation of editorial content.”

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry K6.5 

Other  proposals  generally  did  not  deal  with  this  issue  of  statutory  recognition  explicitly. 
Lord Prescott states that “some incentives will need statutory support.”139 Ofcom sets out a 
number of potential statutory incentives, including costs in legal cases and a new defence 
for  defamation.140  The  MediaWise  Trust,141  through  positive  reference  to  the  Irish  model, 
implicitly accepts the need for a statutory basis for such incentives but makes no comment on 
the desirability or otherwise of it. Similarly, the CCMR142 and Professor Greenslade143 implicitly 
accept a role for the state by promoting the application of VAT zero-rating as an incentive for 
membership, but do not explicitly comment on the implications of such statutory recognition. 
The Alternative Libel Project argues for voluntary ADR which is supported by new rules on 
costs and more consistent and robust case management.144 They are not precise on whether 
this would require legislative changes.

6.6 

Professor Greenslade explicitly accepts that some legislation might be required to construct 
‘sanctions’ for non compliance, without being specific on what that might be. He is clear, 
though, that this is to be an arms length relationship with statute:145

“I would therefore urge that the state’s role is restricted to creating a framework at 
arm’s length in order to create a regulator that is both independent of the industry 
and independent of the state.”

6.7 

He also argues that the judiciary should take into account whether a publisher has signed up 
to a regulatory system,146 but does not propose any statutory basis for that:

“just sticking to the press regulator itself, in my view it is quite clear that you are not 
going to keep everyone on board, not going to be able to levy sanctions against them, 
unless there’s a method of compulsion. I have tried to devise a way in which this is as 
far away from state intervention as it can be.” 147

6.8 

6.9 

Lord Soley suggests that a regulatory body should have the power to take a case to court if 
necessary.148 It is not clear whether he means in relation to existing criminal or civil law or 
with respect to any new rules on standards.

Generally, it would appear that there is a divide between those, exemplified by Lord Black, 
who  have  concerns  that  any  reference  in  statute  to  press  standards  regulation  would  be 
a potential risk to freedom of expression and those who see no immediate problem with 
legislation that recognises a voluntary self-regulatory regime. It is not, however, clear that

into detail about the scope, governance and processes of that self-regulator have been fully 
considered by all of the witnesses.

7.	 Statutory	provision

Statutory underpinning

7.1  Many of the proposals submitted to the Inquiry go beyond statutory recognition and advocate 
some form of statutory underpinning for regulation of press standards. There are a number of 
different statutory models proposed which I briefly set out and consider here individually. The 
level of statutory underpinning differs from proposal to proposal. At one end of the spectrum 
are those that simply use statute to define the characteristics of an otherwise independent 
and voluntary body. At the other end are models that also use statute to compel compliance. 
This difference was set out clearly by Mr Suter:149

“What’s the difference between statutory underpinning and state control? By state 
control  I  think  everybody  has  set  up  this  dangerous  notion  that  the  state  would 
dictate what the press could do, would dictate the standards by which the press had 
to operate and would form judgments as to what was or was not acceptable. I see 
statutory underpinning as being further removed from that, or setting a framework 
within which the regulation happens, but where the regulation itself is carried out by 
independent bodies dealing directly with the press and the regulated entities.”

I have essentially used this distinction in considering the models that have been presented to 
the Inquiry. Models that put the definition and enforcement of standards in the hands of a 
statutory body are considered below as statutory regulation.150

The industry position

7.2 

It is worth starting by considering the industry position on statutory underpinning. Lord Black 
makes it very clear in his submission that the industry rejects, as a matter of principle, any 
form of statutory involvement in, or underpinning of, press standards regulation.151 This is 
not an argument about the strength of regulation but rather about the freedom of the press 
from state control:152

“I have always believed – and I believe it is a view across the bulk of the industry 
– that self-regulation is the guarantor of press freedom and interference (sic) from 
state control.”

7.3 

Lord  Black  argued  that  self-regulation  could  be  tougher  than  a  statutory  system  and  that 
this meant that statutory control was not needed.153 He further argued that, as a matter of 

149 p48, lines 14-25, Tim Suter, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-Morning-

153 p11-12, ibid

1673

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Kprinciple, it was essential that press regulation should be free of statutory intervention.154 He 
raised three specific reasons why a statutory basis for regulation would be inappropriate. The 
first was speed. He argued that no form of statute could keep pace with a fast moving industry 
in the way that self-regulation could.155 I accept the point that the regulations themselves 
need to be capable of relatively swift amendment, but I am at a loss to see why the overall 
structure of regulation would need to be affected by change in this way. It is entirely possible 
to imagine a statutory framework, at a very high level, that would simply require some form of 
regulation to exist and define the accountability structures, leaving all the material regulation 
to a separate, possibly self-regulatory, process. This does not seem to me to be a compelling 
argument in relation to establishing a regulator, still less providing for the recognition of a 
self-regulatory body, in legislation. I note in passing that other industries also operate in a 
fast moving environment – for example, broadcasting and telecommunications – where the 
speed of technological and market change is no less then in the press and media industry, and 
nonetheless manage to exist perfectly well with statutory regulation frameworks.

The second reason advanced for avoiding statute was the risk of ‘losing coverage from the 
system’.156 The argument here is that if publishers did not want to comply with the statutory 
regulation they might relocate their operations outside the UK in order to place themselves 
outside of the jurisdiction of the statute. I can accept that this is potentially a valid argument 
in relation to the economic effect of any compulsory regulation. Clearly, if regulation is to 
be compulsory then some people may seek to evade it. This may be a simple step for those 
whose business is primarily online, although I am less convinced that it is a realistic prospect 
in relation to a printed product which would need to be imported to the UK and distributed 
on a daily basis. In any event, I cannot see how that is relevant to the impact on the ‘coverage 
of the system’. A publisher wanting to avoid a compulsory system would have to take steps to 
do so and may or may not be able to achieve that. A publisher wanting to avoid a voluntary 
self-regulatory system would simply have to put themselves outside it. It is not at all clear 
how this would achieve greater coverage.

7.4 

7.5 

The third reason advanced was that a statutory system would be subject to constant legal 
challenge.157  This  gets  to  the  heart  of  the  industry’s  position  on  any  form  of  statutory 
underpinning for regulation, or indeed, any proposal other than their own, which is that they 
will render it ineffective by whatever means possible. This was articulated quite clearly by 
Lord Black: 158

“A statutory system which would be forced on a majority of unwilling publishers is 
likely to become a target to be aimed at rather than something – a framework within 
which to be worked for the benefit of both the public and the public interest.”

This is not the attitude of an industry committed to raising standards and acting in the public 
interest and must be seen as what it is likely to be: an attempt to use the economic and politi-
cal power of the press to defend their own interests.

7.6 

It is worth reflecting a little on the evidence that Lord Black gave in respect of his objections 
to any statutory involvement. Robert Jay QC pointed out that a statute could do exactly what 
the proposed contract does, both in terms of giving powers to the regulator and by way of

1674

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKimposing limits on what the regulator could do. Lord Black did not dissent but expressed a 
‘philosophical objection’:159

“I – there is a fundamental objection that I have and I believe that the bulk of the 
industry  has  in  allowing  the  state  to  write  the  rules  of  a  regulator  that  governs 
editorial content. It’s not just writing the rules, but presumably producing the style of 
the system and the type of the system that will be there to enforce it. It’s not a circle, 
I think, that can be squared. It is a fundamental philosophical objection to the role of 
the state in the content of newspapers and magazines.”

7.7 

In a subsequent exchange he emphasised the point:160

“LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Well, that means there may be a statute which does not 
create a difference between what the statute could do and what the contract could 
do.
A. The fundamental philosophical objection to it would remain!”

and again, later:161

“Q.  We’ve  defined  our  terms  according  to  your  lexicon,  although,  looking  at  Dr 
Moore’s evidence, he would define the statutory underpin system as equally one of 
self-regulation because there would still be a significant press component or press 
representation within such a system. Do you accept that?
A. No, I don’t – I don’t – I don’t believe that – statutory underpinning is simply a term 
of art for a form of statutory control. I don’t believe there is a halfway house between 
them.”

7.9 

It  is  not  clear,  though,  that  Lord  Black  is  entirely  consistent  in  his  opposition  to  statutory 
involvement. His proposal envisages the possibility of an arbitral arm as part of the regulatory 
body.  This,  he  acknowledges,  would  require  some  form  of  statute  in  order  to  make  it 
compliant with Article 6 ECHR.162 Whilst Lord Black was clear that he has no precise proposal 
for legislation on this issue at present, he was equally clear that his principled objection to 
statutory control did not apply in this context:163

“I have no idea exactly how we would manage that, which piece of legislation we 
could do it in. All I know is it’s not immediately on offer. The point of highlighting this 
here is that the structure of the system would allow it, if at some point Parliament 
saw fit in order to – saw fit to institute it.”

Lord Black was not able to articulate why this from of statutory recognition or underpinning 
for a form of press regulation was acceptable to the industry whilst any other form of statutory 
recognition  or  underpinning,  no  matter  what  its  form  or  content,  could  not  be.  The  only 
conclusion I can draw is that statute providing for an arbitral system would be in the interests 
of the press whereas, in their perception at least, statute providing the framework for robust 
independent regulation would not be.

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry K7.10  Lord  Hunt  clearly  shares  Lord  Black’s  principled  objection  to  a  high  degree.  However,  it 
is perhaps not so clear cut. He told  the Inquiry that recognition  of a code, as in  the Irish 
Defamation Act, would not constitute a statutory regulatory system.164

View of others

7.11  The MST put forward an approach which would place statutory obligations on large news 
publishers  to  regulate  themselves  by  providing  internal  complaints  and  compliance 
mechanisms  and  by  joining  an  external  self-regulatory  body.165  The  statute  would  then 
establish a ‘Backstop Independent Auditor’ (BIA) which would oversee compliance with those 
obligations. The self-regulatory bodies would be responsible for setting their own standards, 
governance  arrangements  and  funding  but  the  BIA  would  have  to  approve  them,  having 
regard to a set of issues already set out in para 3.2 above.166 The BIA would have the power 
to fine a large news organisation that failed to comply with required governance standards167 
or to join an approved self-regulatory body.168 Where a self-regulatory body is found to be in 
breach of required standards, the BIA would have the power to report publicly on the failure, 
hold public hearings, impose fines and, in extremis, remove the recognition.169

7.12  One specific concern about this proposal is the risk that a body such as the BIA, whether 
an individual or a corporate entity but one with no track record, limited powers and limited 
duties, would simply not have the strength and credibility to stand up to the press industry 
should  the  need  arise.  As  has  been  seen  throughout  the  Inquiry,  the  press  is  very  active 
and very able when it comes to lobbying for their interests. I have identified in Part H how 
successive Information Commissioners have been persuaded that they should not concern 
themselves with the activities of the press. It is only to be expected that the press, if faced with 
a new regulatory system over which they do not have complete control, will seek to mitigate 
its impact by whatever means are open to them. Given that this includes the potential use 
of their megaphone to criticise heavily any organisation, and the individuals who run it, it 
follows that a high degree of resilience and strength would be required by any organisation 
required to take on the role.

7.13  Mr  Suter’s  proposal  shares  a  number  of  features  with  the  MST  but  is  closer  to  statutory 
regulation, as I have defined it here, than statutory underpinning. In Mr Suter’s model, Ofcom 
would have a statutory duty to establish a set of regulatory outcomes, which would define 
what activities or media services must be subject to regulation; these could be determined 
by a number of factors including the size of the organisation and the nature of the services it 
provides, and could define the outcomes expected as a result.170 These outcomes would be 
rooted in four principles:171

“– respect for privacy;
–  respect for the truth and fair dealing in reporting;

–  providing information to allow vulnerable audiences to make informed choices.”

7.14  Under  Mr  Suter’s  proposal  those  services  identified  by  Ofcom  would  be  required  to  join 
an authorised self-regulatory body. The authorisation process, and regular auditing, would 
be  carried  out  by  a  re-structured  Ofcom  Content  Board.172  The  requirements  to  obtain 
authorisation a self-regulatory body are set out at para 3.3 above and relate to independent 
governance,  scope,  powers  and  funding.173  If  an  organisation  falls  to  be  regulated  under 
Ofcom’s  framework,  but  declines  to  join  an  authorised  body,  then  it  would  fall  to  Ofcom 
to regulate that organisation against the authorised code considered most appropriate by 
the Ofcom Content Board.174 Where Ofcom has deemed that regulation is required and no 
authorised industry body yet exists to define a code of its own, the Content Board would 
draw  up  a  relevant  code  itself.175  It  is  this  final  element  of  the  proposal  that  makes  Mr 
Suter’s approach potentially cross the boundary from statutory underpinning (requiring self-
regulation) to statutory regulation where the regulator both sets the standards and enforces 
them.

7.15  Ms Harman considers an approach which would use statute to provide for the independence 
of a standards body and to give it jurisdiction to enforce its decisions across all newspapers. 
In this model online news outlets would be able, but not required, to join the system.176

7.16  Mr  Eustice  recommends  giving  Ofcom  powers  to  require  adequate  governance  from 

newspapers to ensure that they are:177

“organised in such a way that allows them to comply with both the Editors’ Code and 
the law.”

This would not give Ofcom any jurisdiction over standards.178 He also advocates giving a right 
of appeal to the Information Commissioners’ Office in relation to privacy complaints. This 
would apply to all media, including the internet, and the ICO would be enforcing existing 
laws.179

7.17  Ofcom suggests that statute might be necessary in order to set out the governance standards for 
a voluntary regulator, including appointment processes, independence and accountability.180

7.18  Sir Charles Gray, on behalf of Early Resolution, argues for the establishment of a statutory 
independent media regulator and compulsory ADR.181 Sir Charles does not specify in detail 
what the role of the statutory regulator would be or how much should be laid down in statute 
but his primary concern is that compliance with standards should be statutory, as an essential

standards should be set.182

7.19  The NUJ put forward a proposal for a statute setting up a new regulator which would be able 
to take complaints, enforce penalties, carry out investigations and monitor performance. The 
legislation would define the membership and jurisdiction of the body and how the body was 
to be funded.183 The regulator would have a role in, but not control of, drawing up a code of 
practice.184 The regulator would have statutory jurisdiction over all publications of a certain 
size and their associated websites,185 as well as statutory power to fine for breaches and to 
insist on the size and placement of a correction or apology.186 Membership would draw on 
journalists, the public, newspaper owners and editors and pressure groups.187

7.20  Mr Mosley proposes an independent but non-statutory standards setting body that would 
have much in common with the current PCC but with a more independent appointments 
process and a greater proportion of independent membership. The standards body (rather 
than serving editors as now) would be responsible for setting the standards.188 There would 
also  be  a  statutory  tribunal  with  the  power  to  enforce  those  standards,  with  compulsory 
jurisdiction over all of the press, agencies of the press and the internet (where not subject 
to Ofcom).189 The Tribunal would have statutory powers inter alia to deal with complaints, 
to require disclosure of information, to award damages, to levy fines, to order a correction 
(specifying content, location and prominence), prevent publication of a story and order an 
item  to  be  removed  from  the  internet.  The  statute  would  also  provide  a  statutory  public 
interest test in relation to privacy matters, impose a prior notification requirement in relation 
to publication of private matters and provide that such prior notice is confidential.

Statutory regulation

7.21  There are some proposals that go beyond a call for statutory underpinning to self-regulation 
and suggest statutory regulation which is not based around industry ownership of standards 
or process.

7.22  Sir  Louis  Blom-Cooper  QC  proposed  the  establishment  of  a  statutory  Commission  on  the 
Media.190 Members of the Commission would be appointed by an appointments commission 
established for the purpose by Parliament. The functions of the Commission would be:191

(a) 
(b) 

to receive and adjudicate on readers’ complaints of breaches of the code of ethics; and
to carry out public inquiries, with power to subpoena witnesses and require disclosure 
of evidence, into press activity that has aroused public concern.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKSir Louis does not elaborate on what powers of remedy, redress or sanction this statutory 
body should have.

7.23  The  Campaign  for  Broadcasting  and  Press  Freedom  recommend  the  establishment  of  a 
statutory Media Standards and Freedom Council.192 In the first instance the Council would 
be appointed by an appointments commission set up by the Ministers. The Council would be 
made up in the following proportions:

(a)  media owners and editors – 20%
(b)  media trade unions – 20%
(c)  members of the public nominated by civil society organisations – 50%
(d)  members of the public selected by a process of application – 10%.

7.24  The  Council  would  produce  a  code  of  ethical  standards,  adjudicate  on  complaints  about 
compliance with that code, administer a public right to redress and keep and publish records 
relating to compliance. The Council would also issue guidance and advice to the media and 
report annually to Parliament. Where the Council found that standards had been breached it 
would be able to require a printed clarification, retraction or apology in a corrections page in 
the publication. The Council would be able to apply to the courts for an order to enforce its 
ruling where necessary.

7.25  The Media Regulation Roundtable proposes a largely statutory, but voluntary, approach. Mr 

Tomlinson QC explained that in his view self-regulation was not an appropriate tool:193

“Well, by “self-regulation” I understand that ultimately, whatever the industry or the 
body is, it’s regulating itself. And it seemed to us that actually there are two interests 
at  play.  There’s  the  interests  of  the  media  and  there’s  the  interests  of  the  public. 
And unless the regulation is independent of both, you’re not going to have true and 
effective regulation. So I don’t myself agree that an independent self-regulation, if 
that is a meaningful phrase at all, is the proper way to proceed.”

7.26  Under the Media Regulation Roundtable proposal, a Media Standards Authority would be 
established  by  statute,  with  its  governance  arrangements  set  down  in  legislation.194  The 
statute would also impose a duty to uphold the freedom and independence of the press.195 
The Authority would have statutory duties to establish a Code Committee (with a minority 
of working editors and journalists) to prepare a code of practice. The Authority would also 
have  to  establish  a  system  of  regulation,  including  pre  publication  advice  and  complaints 
handling, and to set up dispute resolution tribunals. The Authority would, however, only have 
jurisdiction over those who chose to join it.196

7.27 

Summary
It is clear from the descriptions above that there are many different possible approaches to 
the use of statute in relation to securing the highest press standards. These approaches range

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Kfrom establishing in statute the characteristics of a self-regulatory body that would have some 
standing in civil law, through the statutory establishment of a body that would recognise one 
or more self-regulatory bodies, to the statutory establishment of a body that would define 
a set of standards to be adhered. Any of these approaches could, but need not be, coupled 
with a statutory requirement for compliance with a set of standards. There are a different 
set of questions about the use of statute in relation to improving the handling of civil cases; 
those are considered in section 13 below. Strong cases have been advanced for each of these 
different approaches and it seems to me that any of them might have merit. The essential 
point is that a balance must be struck between the use of statute to deliver independence 
from industry and the risk that the use of statute might introduce some element of state 
control of the press which is clearly unacceptable.

7.28 

I  do  not  accept  that  there  is  any  issue  of  principle  preventing,  in  any  circumstance  or 
howsoever framed, the use of legislation in respect of press standards. The question whether 
any particular statutory provision might give rise to any potential infringement of freedom of 
expression or the freedom of the press, or even the remotest risk of such an infringement, 
can  only  be  looked  at  in  the  context  of  the  specific  provision  and  any  statutory  or  other 
protections that could be built in.

8.  the Code
8.1 

Each of the models for standards regulation put before the Inquiry includes the existence of 
a code of standards that those within the regulatory system should comply with. The Inquiry 
considered a range of evidence in relation to two specific issues: who should be responsible 
for drawing up the code; and what should be contained within it. I deal with those two issues 
separately.

8.2 

8.3 

Who should be responsible for drawing up a standards code?
Four different options have been put forward as to who should be responsible for drawing 
up the code. The first is that proposed by Lord Black, and endorsed by Lord Hunt and Mr 
Dacre, that the code should be developed by a committee comprised of a majority of serving 
editors with some lay membership. The second, advanced by, among others, the MST and 
Lord Prescott, is that the code should be drawn up by the industry, possibly in conformity 
with very broad standards set out either in regulation or by an independent body. In these 
models a code that did not meet relevant standards would not be acceptable. In the third 
model the code would be drawn up by an independent body with representation from both 
industry and the public. In the final model the code would be developed by an independent 
regulator.

I  will  look  first  at  the  situation  where  a  code  is  to  be  devised  by  a  set  of  serving  editors, 
albeit  with  some  support  from  lay  members.  Professor  Greenslade  argues  that  there  has 
been little if any controversy about the code and little or no criticism of the changes made by 
the editors’ committee.197 He therefore concludes that editors should remain in the majority 
on the code committee, but that they should be joined by a new Press Ombudsman, public 
representatives  and  some  representatives  from  the  NUJ.198  The  Carnegie  Trust  urges  that 
industry representatives, including editors and journalists, should continue to play a significant

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKrole in overseeing the standards required of the industry, but they do emphasise the need for 
citizens and members of civil society to be given a more prominent role in the process. It is 
suggested that this might be achieved by adding lay members to a code committee but that 
this could be strengthened by an ongoing programme of research into the standards to which 
citizens feel the press should adhere.199

8.4 

The  advantages  of  having  standards  set  by  serving  editors  are  reasonably  self  evident. 
Current editors will be best placed to understand the industry, its practices and the impact of 
technology and competition, in order to take a view on what is practical to deliver. Similarly, 
as  the  Carnegie  Trust  points  out,  the  involvement  of  industry  in  drawing  up  the  code  of 
practice should ensure buy-in in terms of adhering to the standards set out in it.200 Professor 
Greenslade took the view that the performance of the Code Committee to date was proof 
that the system was effective:201

“the Code Committee is a very, very straightforward matter, not problematic in my 
view, and working editors on it makes sense. It’s not as if they’ve designed the code 
in private to favour themselves. The code has, in fact, constrained them, and so – you 
pointed out that it’s largely very negative in that sense. So I would have thought the 
code is an example of the editors having behaved rather well.”

8.5 

However, the disadvantages also seem to me to be clear and are persuasive. Mr Richards 
was extremely clear that, from an Ofcom perspective, it would be entirely inappropriate for 
serving editors, or others currently active in the industry, to have any part in approving the 
standards to which the industry should conform. He said: 202

“I think we would draw a very very strong and clear distinction between advice which 
I  think  it  is  very  important  to  take  from  those  with  experience  and  ideally  recent 
experience  of  the  relevant  industry  in  which  we  do  our  sales,  and  the  precedents 
on decision-making or determinative functions of the regulator of participants and 
active – people actively involved in the industry at present. I think that is quite the 
wrong  thing  to  do  and  makes  effective  and  reliable  independent  decision-making 
extremely difficult, and to be honest in our context is unimaginable.
The idea that we would have and we could stand up in public and defend decisions 
we made if we had serving broadcasters on our decision-making bodies or on our 
code-setting bodies, I think is –
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Even on the code-setting body?
MR RICHARDS: Yes.
DR BOWE: Yes.
MR RICHARDS: Yes, absolutely. And I will say in terms of code setting, in terms of 
sanctions,  in  terms  of  corrections  or  anything  of  that  kind  and  in  terms  of  policy 
making overall, you need to have a bright line separation between those who are 
regulating and making decisions and those who are regulated, and I think any breach 
of that in my view, in our experience, means that you will immediately undermine the 
perception and indeed in all reality the actuality of your independence.”

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry K8.6 

That is a general matter of good regulatory practice, but it seems to me that there is also 
an industry specific point to consider here. In most models of self-regulation where serving 
professionals are involved in any way in the process of regulation, the pool from which those 
serving professionals can be drawn will be many thousands of people. In terms of editors of 
national newspapers, however, the pool is limited to no more than 20 or so. It is in this context 
that editors have been described as ‘marking their own homework’. Indeed, when it comes 
to the role of serving editors on the code committee, it might just as aptly be seen as editors 
setting their own homework. It is clear that there are a number of very powerful individuals 
within the industry who have, or are perceived to have, a strong influence on others in the 
industry. This means that, if serving editors are in the majority on a code committee, there is 
the risk of power being located in the hands of one or two people who have the most to gain 
from setting standards that they are prepared to live with, rather than standards that are set 
with the best interests of the public in mind. None of this is to argue that serving editors do 
not have an important role to play in advising on the standards to be set. The issue here is 
simply about whether they should be responsible for taking the actual decisions as to what 
standards should apply.

8.7 

The second model I consider is one whereby the press (quite possibly, but not necessarily, 
including serving editors) draw up the code but the code then has to be approved or recognised 
by some independent body. Lord Prescott says that it makes sense for the industry to remain 
the primary drafting body for the code but:203

“that  in  order  to  maintain  credibility  in  the  eyes  of  the  public  the  code  should  be 
reviewed  and  endorsed  by  ‘a  body  with  the  interests  of  the  public,  not  the  press, 
at  heart,  which  could  be  the  regulator,  Parliament  of  another  body  appointed  by 
Parliament.”

8.8 

8.9 

This  model  is  also  adopted  by  the  MST  and  Mr  Suter,  who  both  put  the  need  for  self-
regulatory  industry  bodies,  setting  their  own  standards,  at  the  heart  of  their  models.  In 
the MST model, the Backstop Independent Auditor would provide written guidance on the 
minimum commitments that it expected to be contained within a code of practice and would 
then look for those minimum commitments to be met when considering approval of a self-
regulatory body.204 In Mr Suter’s model, Ofcom would set out high level regulatory outcomes 
to be achieved and the Ofcom Content Board would look to see that the self-regulatory body 
had  given  itself  appropriate  scope  and  powers  to  deliver  those  outcomes  in  considering 
authorisation.205 In both models the detail of the standards code, and the process of arriving 
at that detail, would be a matter solely for the relevant self-regulatory body.

The third model I look at is that of an independent body with a mix of industry and public 
representation.  Mr  Mosley  proposes  replacing  the  PCC  with  a  Press  Commission  with  an 
independently  appointed  chairman  but  membership  otherwise  largely  unchanged.  His 
approach involves this body being solely responsible for making and amending the code of 
practice.206 This Press Commission is not a regulator as it has no powers of enforcement and 
simply sets the standards.

8.10  Finally I come to the model which has standards setting simply in the hands of the independent 
regulator.  The  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  makes the drawing  up  of  a code  the ‘central

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKfunction’  of  their  proposed  Media  Standards  Authority.  In  order  to  do  this  they  would 
establish a broadly representative committee, including serving editors, as well as journalists 
and  independent  figures.207  The  Campaign  for  Broadcasting  Standards  and  Press  Freedom 
proposes  that  a  statutory  Media  Standards  and  Freedom  Council  should  be  responsible 
for producing a code of ethical standards “in consultation with the media industry and the 
general public.”208 Sir Louis Blom-Cooper advocates that a statutory independent regulatory 
body would be responsible for a code of ethics.209 The CCMR would give full responsibility 
for  establishing  and  updating  standards  to  its  statutory,  but  voluntary,  News  Publishing 
Commission. The Commission would include editors, journalists and members of the public.210

8.11  A number of the proposals leave the matter of ownership of the code somewhat obscure. 
The MediaWise Trust talks of a new code211 but does not say who is to be responsible for 
drawing it up. The NUJ says that “the new regulator should have a role in drawing up a code of 
practice”212 but stops short of saying who should have the ultimate responsibility for deciding 
on the contents of the code.

8.12 

In many ways this issue of who is responsible for setting the standards goes to the very heart 
of a new regime. It is important to balance the current industry expertise inherent in serving 
editors  and  journalists  with  the  need  for  independence  in  setting  standards.  It  seems  to 
me that the appropriate balance is provided by some form of system that draws heavily on 
current editorial expertise via an advisory body, but leaves the ultimate approval of the code 
to a more independent regulatory body which has the primary duty of serving the public 
interest in respect both of the freedom of the press and the rights of individuals.

8.13 

Contents of the code
I turn now to the content of the code. It has been said by many witnesses to the Inquiry that 
the current Editors’ Code of Practice is a good code. There certainly seems to me to be a 
substantial consensus that the existing code captures much good practice. Ms Harman, for 
example, sees no need for changes to the code:213

“It is widely acknowledged by editors, journalists, campaigners, and academics that 
the current Editors’ Code of Practice is broadly fit for purpose – the key issue is its 
enforceability. The Code – which covers fairness, accuracy, the differences between 
reporting and comment – could continue to be used.”

However,  there  have  also  been  reservations  expressed  in  relation  to  some  aspects  of  the 
code.214 This chapter reflects any proposals made for changes to the content of the code and 
does not attempt to be an assessment of the value of the current code.

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry K8.14  The Inquiry heard evidence from a number of academics with specific expertise in ethical 
issues who felt that the code could benefit from revision. Professor Chris Megone described 
the code as:215

“a code that has been developed primarily from the point of view of things that can 
go wrong in media practice. It has a view of ethics as something to be turned on in 
order to stop people behaving badly, rather than of ethics as being concerned more 
broadly with good judgement and a positive contribution to society.”

He goes on to point out that the code is largely a series of prohibitions  but that it is not 
very  precise  in  terms  of  what  is  an  absolute  prohibition  and  where  there  is  a  prohibition 
that can be overridden. He says that ‘this imprecision is likely to lead to a certain laxity of 
interpretation’.216 His conclusion is that the code needs to be set more in the context of the 
specific  critical  contribution  that  a  free  press  can  make  to  the  public  interest,  and  that  it 
should be developed in terms of the duties to the key parties with whom the relevant press 
interact in different ways.217

8.15  Dr Rowan Croft suggested that there would be merit in the code requiring proprietors, editors 
and  journalists  to  declare  their  financial  and  political  interests  to  their  readers.  Similarly, 
there could be a requirement for declaration to readers of any payment made or received 
for information relating to the publication of a story.218 This would help to give readers the 
information that they need in order to be able to accurately assess what they are being told 
in the newspaper.

8.16  A number of the proposals suggest that more thought needs to be given to the meaning of 
‘public interest’ in the context of the code. The Media Regulation Roundtable suggests that 
some guidance on how the code should approach the public interest should be set out in 
statute.219 Lord  Prescott  said  that, though  much  of  the code  needs no  amendment, there 
needs to be a wider debate on the definition of the public interest, in particular if it is to gain 
enhanced status as a defence in the courts.220 The Carnegie Trust agrees that understanding 
the  public  interest  in  the  context  of  the  code  requires  more  thought  and  recommends 
ongoing research to understand citizens’ views on the matter.221 Lord Soley also raises issues 
of concern around both the definition of the public interest in the code and its application.222 
This question of what is the public interest in the various different contexts in which it is used 
in relation to the press is, of course, a central one and is dealt with in detail at the start of this 
Report.223

8.17  Dr Neil Manson queries the effectiveness of the code provisions on accuracy:224

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK“It is good that the Code places “The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, 
misleading or distorted information, including pictures” to the fore. But, unfortunately, 
there is no account given of what constitutes accuracy, or distortion or misleading. 
This  is,  of  course,  problematic  for  it  leaves  considerable  interpretative  leeway  in 
deciding what constitutes acceptable communication.”

8.18  Separately, Professor Manson queries the inclusion of the ‘public’s right to know’. The scope 
of the right is undefined, the nature of the right (a positive right to know or a negative right 
not  to  be  prevented  from  knowing)  is  unclear  and  neither  is  practical.  Professor  Manson 
concludes that:225

“In any replacement code of practice there should be no mention at all of “the right to 
know” unless some decent argument can be given to show how it denotes a coherent 
right.”

8.19  Another  issue  that  has  been  raised  in  relation  to  the  code  is  the  separation  of  fact  and 
comment. Mr Eustice urges that the Code should be redrafted to strengthen the requirement 
to separate comment and fact. His specific proposals are:226

“A greater emphasis on this principle might be achieved by setting out in the code a 
presumption against using conjecture or opinion in a news story headline. It could also 
state far more clearly a presumption that opinion must appear in a separate editorial 
article and that, where practical, the basis for any conjecture should be sourced.”

8.20  A  final  point  worth  considering  here  is  that  the  code  itself,  although  important,  can  only 
achieve  any  improvement  in  standards  if  it  is  followed.  The  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from 
many editors and journalists who claimed that the current code was the touchstone of their 
every decision. Doubtless in many (if not most) cases it is but, in the context of the extensive 
evidence the Inquiry has been given of behaviour in clear contravention of the code, this 
assertion can be taken too far and there is clearly room for improvement. The Inquiry has also 
been told many times that there is nothing wrong with the code, only with the enforcement 
of the code. Similarly, many industry witnesses told the inquiry that the problem was not 
with the self-regulation of the industry but with the enforcement of the law, as though the 
code did not prohibit illegal activity. In order to achieve anything the code needs not only to 
be well drafted, it must also be lived by the individuals and organisations to whom it applies.

8.21  Professor  Baroness  O’Neill  reflected  that  professional  codes  on  their  own  have  a  limited 
efficacy, particularly where ‘professions’ lack powers or willingness to discipline their errant 
members. This, she says, sets limits to the effectiveness of any ethical codes adopted by parts 
of the media and means that ethical codes, while important, are not enough.227 She goes on 
to say:228

“traditionally ethical codes worked because they were embedded in cultural and social 
norms that were widely respected and adhered to, making shame and exclusion the 
principal sanctions for violations. Adherence to these ethical norms standards cannot 
be achieved in a scattered workforce, without entry requirements, agreed standards 
of practice, benchmarks of progression or ways of barring inadequate practitioners.”

1685

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry K8.22  Professor Megone suggested that:229

“to make a code a lived code, media organisations need to attend to the critical factors 
that can bring about an ethical organisation, or promote integrity in an organisation. 
These factors include tone from the top (or leadership), an open and honest culture, 
and so on.”

8.23  Dr Manson noted that:230

“where ethically problematic ‘cultures’ or sets of practices are entrenched, there may 
be no plausible ‘quick fix’……..However, it is a fallacy to argue from the fact that a 
quick fix is unavailable to the conclusion that nothing can be, or ought to be, done.”

9.	 Complaint	handling
9.1 

Complaint handling forms by far the largest part of the work of the PCC and a consistent and 
effective approach will be required in any new regulatory system. Two specific issues have 
arisen here. The first is by whom complaints should be resolved. The second is from whom 
complaints should be accepted. I look at the two in turn.

Who should adjudicate on complaints?

Internal complaint handling

9.2 

The first point to address in this context is how complaints are handled internally by publishers 
and what has been described as the ‘outsourcing’ of complaints to the PCC. It seems clear 
that, under the existing PCC regime, few national publishers have effective mechanisms in 
place to deal with complaints from readers or others with concerns about their content; I 
have not taken sufficient evidence in relation to the regional and local press to know whether 
this  holds  true for  them as  well.  There are beacons  of  good  practice, and  The  Guardian’s 
‘Readers’ Editor’ is the most developed that has been evidenced before the Inquiry. At one 
of the Inquiry’s opening seminars, Mr Dacre announced the creation of a corrections column 
in the Daily Mail231 and there have been suggestions that others might follow suit. However, 
as a general rule it appears that national publishers have been content for complainants to 
go directly to the PCC and are content for the PCC then to attempt to mediate the matter. 
Certainly  the  PCC  protocols  do  not  include  encouraging  bilateral  resolution  between  the 
publisher and the complainant.

9.3 

This has two significant consequences. First, the PCC has a large workload of minor complaints 
that can be easily resolved by mediation and that could possibly be resolved more quickly, 
more easily and more cheaply on a bilateral basis. The provision of a central clearing house 
for this type of complaint makes little obvious sense. Second, there is a risk that editors may 
outsource the judgment over whether material they publish is compliant with the code, or its 
use is ethical, at the same time as they outsource the process of handling the complaint. Lord 
Black accepts that complaints should, in the main, be dealt with directly by the editor of the

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKpublication concerned, as that is likely to be the fastest way to resolve a dispute; the dispute 
should only then become a matter for the regulator when bilateral resolution is not possible. 
He argues that the changes to internal compliance systems inherent in his proposal should 
ensure that this would happen more often than it does now.232

9.4 

The  MediaWise  Trust  proposes  that  publishers  should  take  a  number  of  measures  to 
strengthen  in-house  handling  of  complaints  as  part  of  a  wider  set  of  recommendations 
around re-building trust in the media:233

•  “An in-house but independent Reader’s Editor on every publication above an 

agreed circulation/ratings threshold;

•  a regular Corrections column or programme, which might include review of 

the company’s own journalism; and

•  a commitment to give suitable prominence to upheld complaints (and to offer 

compensation if appropriate).”

9.5 

9.6 

9.7 

9.8 

Lord Prescott made this point in his submission, commenting that complaints currently seem 
to be ‘outsourced’ to the PCC, making them seem distant from the ongoing operations of the 
newspaper in question. He goes on to suggest that the new system should look to see more 
complaints being resolved via the organisation’s internal mechanisms.234

I certainly agree that publishers should take more responsibility for their own compliance 
with standards and that having an effective and independent mechanism for dealing with 
complaints in-house is an important part of this.

Complaint handling by a regulatory body

All  of  the  proposals  submitted  to  the  Inquiry  envisage  complaints  handling  to  be  one  of 
the key functions of their proposed regulatory body. Relatively few go into any detail about 
how, or by whom, those complaints should be handled. Lord Black’s proposal on behalf of 
the industry envisages a Complaints Committee comprising some serving editors and a lay 
majority. Although it is clear that, on the PCC, serving editors absent themselves from the 
process in relation to any decision on their newspaper, it is impossible to ignore the potential 
influence of a small number of extremely powerful individuals on the whole process.

In section 8 above I set out the exchange that I had with Mr Richards of Ofcom about the 
propriety of including serving editors at any decision making level in a regulatory regime. 
His view, that allowing members of the regulated population any part in regulatory decision 
making is entirely inappropriate, applies at least as much in relation to complaint adjudication 
as  it  does  to  standard  setting.  The  CPVs  urge  that  adjudicators  must  be  independent  of 
Government, Parliament and the press, and that serving editors should have no role in the 
adjudicating or investigating bodies.235 Professor Greenslade said that retired editors would 
have ‘baggage’ and that they would not have up-to-date knowledge of the industry. He also

productive.236

9.9 

By contrast Mr Mosley proposes a statutory independent Tribunal to decide on all complaints, 
with each being decided by an individual  adjudicator.237 Mr Mosley does not indicate any 
requirement for the adjudicator to have any, let alone current, media experience. Similarly 
the MST proposes a statutory regulatory body with the power to adjudicate over disputes, 
although only in relation to those publishers who choose to join the regime.238

An ombudsman approach?

9.10  A  significant  number  of  the  proposals  put  to  the  Inquiry  suggest  what  is  described  as  an 
‘ombudsman’  to  handle  complaints.  The  British  and  Irish  Ombudsman  Association  (BIOA) 
sets out a number of criteria for ombudsman schemes. These cover independence, fairness, 
effectiveness,  openness  and  transparency,  and  accountability.  It  is  clear  that  none  of  the 
proposals  submitted  to  the  Inquiry  actually  envisage  a  body  with  the  independence  that 
would  be  required  for  it  to  be  recognised  as  an  ombudsman  by  BIOA,  as  they  generally 
draw  their  authority  from  a  self-regulatory  industry  body  without  an  obvious  guarantee 
of independence. It should, perhaps, be noted here that, although many of the proposals 
draw on the Irish Press Ombudsman as an analogy, the BIOA does not recognise the Irish 
Press  Ombudsman  as  fulfilling  their  definition  of  an  ombudsman  because  there  is  not  a 
clear separation between the ombudsman and the Press Council in terms of appointment, 
reporting  and  appeal;  the  BIOA  consider  that  regime  to  be  a  complaint  handling  scheme 
only.239 The main thing that distinguishes these proposals from that of Lord Black is that they 
envisage adjudications being made by a single person, not a committee, and do not rely on 
current media experience.

9.11  Lord  Prescott  advocates  the  establishment  of  an  ombudsman.  Complaints  could  only  be 
taken  to  the  ombudsman  once  the  company’s  internal  mechanisms  had  been  exhausted; 
the ombudsman would then encourage a quick and mutually agreed solution but should be 
able  to  adjudicate  on  the  complaint  where  necessary.240  The  ombudsman  could  be  asked 
to look at matters which might otherwise be the subject of civil litigation. There would be 
no requirement on complainants to use the ombudsman, but courts might take a decision 
to  side-step  this  option  into  account  when  considering  a  case.  Similarly,  the  courts  could 
consider  the  decision  of  the  ombudsman  if  this  channel  was  used.241  The  Carnegie  Trust 
suggests  the  appointment  of  an  ombudsman  to  investigate  and  adjudicate  on  complaints 
because of the perceived benefits of independence, public profile, trust and effectiveness.242 
Similarly,  the  MediaWise  Trust  recommends  the  creation  of  an  ombudsman.  As  in  other 
models, the complaint would first have had to be considered bilaterally with the publisher.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKThe ombudsman would seek to resolve the matter swiftly and to the satisfaction of all parties, 
and could arrange oral hearings or conciliation meetings if appropriate.243

9.12  The  BIOA  concluded  that  there  is  a  role  for  a  press  ombudsman  scheme  as  part  of  a 
proportionate system of checks and balances and provided its own set of proposals as to how 
a genuinely independent press ombudsman scheme might work. The BIOA notes that there is 
no current ombudsman scheme appropriate to take on the role, so a new scheme would be 
required. Specifically, and among other things, it recommends:244

“the name ‘ombudsman’ should not be used unless the body complies fully with the 
BIOA criteria for ombudsmen;
any  ombudsman  scheme  should  be  constituted  as  an  independent  body  entirely 
separate from any regulatory body;
any ombudsman scheme should have an independent board of directors, appointed 
on terms that secure their independent from those appointing them;
Board members should not be appointed by a body which has more than minority 
representation from the industry, and not more than a minority of the board members 
should be from the industry;
the independent board should appoint the ombudsmen, on terms that secure their 
independence from those appointing them;
the scope and powers of any ombudsman scheme should be set independently, in the 
public interest, and not set by ‘negotiation’ with the industry;
any  ombudsman  should  be  operationally  independent,  so  that  no  regulator  or 
industry body has any influence on its approach and decisions;
the  funding  arrangements  should  ensure  sufficient  resources  for  the  workload, 
and  not  provide  any  lever  for  the  industry  to  try  and  exert  any  influence  over  the 
ombudsman’s approach.”

Who can make a complaint?

9.13  The position with respect to who can make a complaint to the PCC is set out earlier in this 
Report.245 Very few of the proposals submitted to the Inquiry deal explicitly with this issue. The 
Carnegie Trust recommends that the ombudsman should be able to take complaints from any 
concerned citizen, not merely from those directly affected by the article in question.246 The 
CPVs argue that complaints should be able to be brought by the subject (or intended subject) 
of the publication or by third parties.247 The NUJ urges that those impacted collectively should 
be able to complain and seek a right of redress.248

1689

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry K9.14  Mr Dacre expresses concern at the idea, set out in the Inquiry’s published draft criteria for an 
effective regulatory regime, that third party complaints might result in ‘credible remedies’. He 
argued that this could:249

“open a Pandora’s box of problems with every lobby and fringe pressure group in 
Britain  (and  abroad)  deluging  the  regulator  with  complaints  which  may  often  be 
politically  or  ideologically  motivated  and  aimed  at  forcing  newspapers  to  report 
events in a way that furthers the group’s objectives.”

His proposal is that the standards body should be able to take third party complaints, at their 
discretion, but only with a view to formulating a judgment that could result in changes to the 
code.250

9.15  The  BIOA  raise  a  concern  that  the  wider  complainant  eligibility  is  drawn,  the  greater  the 
burden  on  business  and  any  ombudsman  scheme,  and  the  greater  the  chance  that  some 
cases might be brought for ‘campaigning’ rather than redress reasons. The solution proposed 
by the BOIA is that it might be open to representative groups to bring a complaint, but that 
should be subject to some requirement for ‘permission’.251 The same type of hurdle (whatever 
the scheme) might avoid the problems which concerned Mr Dacre.

Standards: investigatory powers

9.16  The  purpose  of  a  complaints  handling  mechanism  is  to  deal  with  issues  as  they  affect  an 
individual:  it  could  be  considered  as  loosely  analogous  to  the  remedies  available  through 
the  civil  law,  where  the  point  at  issue  is  the  impact  on  the  individual.  A  regulatory  body, 
as  opposed  to  a  complaints  handler,  would  also  have  an  interest  in  the  maintenance  of 
standards for their own sake: this could be considered as loosely analogous to the criminal 
law, where the focus is on the maintenance of minimum standards and the determination of 
an appropriate sanction if that standard is not met.

9.17  So it is not enough that the regulatory body should have the power to deal with complaints; it 
also needs to have the power to consider compliance with standards and to take action where 
standards are systemically or significantly breached, irrespective of whether a complaint has 
been made in respect of the breach. The PCC has been widely described as a good complaints 
handler but not a regulator. The key to the ability of the regulator to take action in relation to 
systemic or significant breaches is the power to investigate potential incidents.

9.18  The failure of the PCC to use any investigatory powers that it might have had in relation to 
phone hacking has led a number of witnesses to emphasise the need for a new system to 
include investigatory powers. Lord Black’s proposal on behalf of the industry sets out details 
for a standards and investigatory arm that would have the power to carry out investigations 
in respect of significant, systemic breaches. This proposal is described and analysed earlier in 
the Report252 but is worth noting when considering the other proposals that have been made 
with regard to investigatory powers.

9.19  Where  the  issue  is  addressed  explicitly  by  proposals,  there  is  unanimous  support  for  a 
regulatory  body  having  investigatory  powers.  Lord  Prescott  advocates  that  the  regulatory

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKbody should have the power to appoint a suitably skilled investigator, at the regulated firms’ 
expense,  to  address  questions  that  the  regulator  may  have.253  Sir  Louis  Blom-Cooper  QC 
argues for a statutory power for a regulatory body to hold public inquiries into ‘any press 
activity  that  has  aroused,  or  is  likely  to  arouse,  public  concern’.254  Mr  Suter  says  that  the 
self-regulatory bodies must have ‘adequate powers’ including at a minimum the power to 
investigate broader or systemic problems.255 Professor Greenslade proposes giving a power 
to  investigate  to  a  media  ombudsman  who  could  investigate  where  there  is  evidence  of 
systemic breaches of the code.256 The Media Regulation Roundtable says: 257

“In  addition,  the  MSA  would  have  the  power  to  investigate  apparent  breaches  of 
the MSA Code by participants without a specific complaint having been made by a 
member of the public.”

9.20  Ofcom supports the introduction of a power to investigate but warns:258

“Ensuring  powers  of  investigation  are  only  available  post  publication  would  be 
consistent with preserving the independence of the press and rights of free expression.”

9.21 

It seems to me entirely right that any press standards body should have both a duty to maintain 
standards and the power to initiate its own investigations, in particular in respect of concerns 
relating to systemic or significant standards breaches. It is entirely conceivable, especially in 
privacy cases, that the subject of a story may not wish to draw more fire upon his head from 
an offending publication by making a formal complaint. This should not prevent a standards 
body  from  carrying  out  whatever  investigation  is  necessary  to  identify  whether  there  has 
been a breach of standards and, if so, applying the appropriate sanction. One approach might 
be to give the standards body the power (in appropriately serious cases) to bring a complaint 
in relation to a specific article, albeit allowing the complaint handling process to take account 
of the failure of the affected party to complain.

9.22  Further, in relation to complaints by groups, although I have recognised the concern expressed 
by Mr Dacre and would endorse a filter system to remove complaints that are ideologically 
motivated only to further the group’s objectives, I do not otherwise accept the argument. 
As I have pointed out earlier259 the current Editor’s Code outlaws prejudicial or pejorative 
reference to an individual’s race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any physical 
or mental illness or disability, but does not provide similar protection in respect of groups. It 
is difficult to understand why there should not be some mechanism for representative groups 
to engage in challenges similarly based on the standards set out in the code.

9.23 

In addition, I see no reason why representative organisations should not be entitled to raise 
a complaint in relation both to accuracy and prejudice where articles are discriminatory in 
respect of a group. Where such articles are found to have breached the relevant standards

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Kto the level that can trigger a standards investigation, it should be possible for the standards 
body to impose whatever sanctions or redress they would normally impose in respect of a 
breach of standards.

9.24  A number of proposals mention that individuals should be able to have complaints dealt with 
without incurring costs. This is an important point, and nobody has suggested otherwise. I 
entirely agree and applaud the fact that this has been one of the high points of the way in 
which the PCC has operated.

10.	 Remedies	and	redress
10.1  For this purpose I draw a distinction between ‘remedies’ or ‘redress’, the primary purpose of 
which is to make good, or compensate for, the harm done to another party and ‘sanctions’, 
the  primary  purpose  of  which  I  take  to  be  punishment  for  breach  and  should  impact 
primarily on the wrongdoer. For example, in a system with a regulator and an independent 
ombudsman, the ombudsman would be interested in redress and might require a company 
to  pay  compensation  to  an  individual  who  has  suffered  at  a  level  that  reflects  their  loss, 
whilst the regulator might, in respect of the same breach, impose a fine, the level of which is 
designed to demonstrate the severity of the breach. The proposals considered in this section 
refer to redress and remedies that might be awarded by a regulatory complaints body for 
breach  of  a  code  of  standards,  not  to  any  redress  or  remedies  that  might  be  awarded  in 
respect of breach of civil rights. That is dealt with in the section below on dispute resolution.

10.2  The only remedy currently open to the PCC is to require a correction to be published, and 
the only redress is the publication of an apology, both with the placing and prominence to 
be agreed between the publisher and the PCC. Under the proposals submitted by Lord Black, 
this position on remedy and redress for those who have been harmed by press misconduct 
would  remain  unchanged.  The  Campaign  for  Broadcasting  and  Press  Freedom  takes  a 
similar approach to redress but advocates a dedicated section on the editorial page to carry 
corrections, clarifications and apologies.260

10.3  A  substantially  wider  range  of  remedies  and  redress  have  been  put  to  the  Inquiry  in  the 
proposals for the future. The CPVs argue that the press adjudicator should have the power 
to make compensatory awards, to require the publication of corrections, and to determine 
the prominence given to such corrections.261 Most, but not all, of the CPVs also consider that 
an adjudicator should have the power to prevent publication similar to an injunction.262 Mr 
Mosley specifically advocates all of those powers as well as proposing that the Tribunal should 
have the power to order newspapers and photographers to leave a complainant alone, ban 
the use of photographs, and order an item to be removed from the internet.263

10.4  Lord Prescott proposes that a press ombudsman should have the powers to:264

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK“obtain[..] prompt equal-prominence corrections to quickly limit harm and/or redress 
the damage inflicted on the individual;
award[…]  damages,  which  are  significantly  material  to  genuinely  recognise  the 
distress and suffering caused to the complainant;”

10.5  Similarly, the Carnegie Trust says that a press ombudsman should have the power to require 
news providers to issue prompt and prominent corrections and apologies for factual errors 
or misleading articles, and award compensation if appropriate.265 The BIOA considers that 
any ombudsman should be able to award redress (up to a specified monetary limit) and/or 
require the business to take specified steps in relation to the business. The decisions of the 
ombudsman should be binding on the business.266

10.6  Ms Harman considers that the regulator should have the power to order the prominence 
and wording of an apology,267 as does the NUJ,268 while Mr Eustice says they should be able 
to  dictate  the  size  and  prominence  of  corrections.269  Ofcom  suggests  that  a  strengthened 
self-regulatory system might have strong rules in relation to equal prominence of apologies 
and  corrections,  with  determination  by  the  regulator  rather  than  as  part  of  a  process  of 
negotiation with editors.270

10.7  The MediaWise Trust says that:

“breaches of the new code should be dealt with like any other violation of professional 
standards or human rights – with appropriate sanctions, including compensation for 
the victims.” 271

In addition they argue that the costs of successful complainants should be met, within a mod-
est cap.272 The Campaign for Media Reform also advocates the regulator having the power to 
award compensation,273 as does the Media Reform Roundtable.274

10.8  Sir Louis Blom-Cooper acknowledges some concerns around giving a regulator the right to 
dictate the wording and/or placement and size of a correction or apology, on the grounds 
that this might constitute an infringement of the right to freedom of expression. By way of 
authority he refers to the Supreme Court of the United States in Miami Herald v Tomillo,275 
which held that a statutory right to reply to a newspaper article was an interference with 
editorial freedom and hence contrary to freedom of the press under the First Amendment 
to  the  US  Constitution.  By  way  of  contrast,  however,  he  also  pointed  to  the  decision  of 
the  European  Human  Rights  Commission  in  Ediciones  Tiempo  v  Spain,276  which  rejected  a

plenty of opportunity to publish his own version of events so that the marketplace of ideas 
was enhanced, not contracted.277

10.9 

It seems to me that there is no rationale for allowing the publisher to have some kind of 
veto over the wording, placement or prominence of a correction or apology made as a result 
of  a  code  breach.  These  are  matters  which  a  regulatory  body  should  have  the  power  to 
dictate. Whether or not it is appropriate for the regulatory body to have powers to award 
compensation to complainants might depend on the relationship between the regulator and 
any dispute resolution system.278

11.	 Sanctions
11.1  Sanctions  are  a  vital  part  of  any  effective  standards  regime.  Sanctions  must  obviously  be 
proportionate, but a regime will have limited impact if the sanction for breach is not sufficient 
to incentivise compliance. Ofcom refers to the important of effective powers of enforcement 
and sanction as:279

 “a genuine deterrent both to the party being punished and as a warning to other 
regulated parties.”

Negative comment

11.2  The  only  sanction  available  to  the  PCC  currently  is  to  reach  an  adverse  adjudication  and 
require its publication.280 The proposal by Lord Black on behalf of the industry would continue 
to restrict the complaints body to adverse adjudication, and the publication of a correction 
or apology, in respect of individual complaints. He also proposes that the standards body be 
given the power to investigate in a way that could result in the imposition of fines in relation 
to serious or systemic breaches.

11.3  Sir Louis Blom-Cooper proposes a system entirely based around the publication of report on 
specific topics and outcomes from public inquiries into media malpractices. This, he argues, 
would inform the public and wield influence, rather than power.281

Fines

11.4  Despite the apparent general acceptance by the industry of the need for a self-regulatory 
standards body to have the power to levy fines, this is not accepted without question by 
everybody. Sir Louis is worried that too high a fine might impact on the ability of a journalist, 
editor  or  publisher  to  continue  to  practice,  and  thus  impinge  on  the  right  to  freedom  of 
expression.282

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK11.5  Lord Prescott argues that the regulatory body must have financial penalties as a tool at its 
disposal. He recognises that in a voluntary body it might be difficult to secure agreement 
on the power to levy fines, but nonetheless (as noted above) takes the view that the body 
should have the power to award damages.283

11.6  On the other side of the argument, the CPVs,284 Ms Harman,285 Mr Eustice,286 the Carnegie 
Trust,287 the MediaWise Trust,288 the NUJ,289 the Campaign for Media Reform,290 Max Mosley,291 
Professor  Greenslade,292  Ofcom,293  and  the  Media  Regulation  Roundtable294  are  clear  that 
the regulator should have the power to levy fines. The MediaWise Trust is severe about the 
efficacy of the power of adverse adjudication, saying:295

“the new system will need genuine sanctions rather than the current fiction that peer 
pressure alone maintains standards. Breaches of the Code should be treated serious 
and  persistent  breaches  should  be  dealt  with  severely.  Editors  whose  newspapers 
have been found in breach of their own Code have in the past, remained in post or 
been ‘promoted’ or even remain on the PCC or the Editors’ Code Committee. It is not 
surprising that such a system is viewed with contempt.”

11.7 

I am inclined to agree. It is important that any new press standards regulatory body should 
have  sufficiently  strong  sanctions  to  provide  an  incentive  to  press  to  comply  with  agreed 
standards. I do not find it credible that the power of negative adjudication on its own provides 
that and it seems sensible that the regulator should have the power to levy proportionate 
fines. Given Lord Black’s proposals in this area I do not expect this to be a very controversial 
conclusion.

11.8  The Carnegie Trust notes that in a voluntary system the ultimate sanction is expulsion from 
the system, with whatever benefits might have accrued from being in the system.296 This is, 
of course, only a sanction of any significance if membership of the system carries significant 
benefits and is inappropriate for a system whose strength is intended to be its inclusivity of 
all.

11.9  Mr Eustice proposes a higher level of sanction, arguing that Ofcom should be given the power 
to ensure that the internal governance systems of newspapers are such as to allow them to

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Kcomply with the code and the law.297 Mr Eustice does not specifically say that Ofcom should 
be able to fine newspapers for failure to comply but, given the nature of Ofcom’s current 
regulatory powers, that must be the logical inference; in truth, there is no other ultimate 
sanction.

12.	 Dispute	resolution
12.1  The sections above dealt with breaches of a standards code. This section deals with breaches 
of civil rights by media organisations. It is a fact that many, but by no means all, complaints 
relating to a breach of a press standards code will be in respect of breaches that potentially give 
rise to an action in tort. The question must therefore arise as to whether such issues should 
be  considered  as  code  breaches,  breaches  of  civil  rights  or  both.  The  PCC  has  historically 
taken the view that it will not consider a complaint that is the subject of legal action, and 
that any complaint will be suspended pending the outcome of legal action should action be 
commenced after a complaint has been made. Complainants can, and sometimes do, take 
legal action following resolution of a case by the PCC. The PCC complaints system is free and 
can by relatively quick. Taking action through the courts, by contrast, is both extremely slow 
and can be extremely expensive.

12.2  Many of those proposing ways forward on standards to the Inquiry have, either as a part of 
their proposed solution or as the foundation of it, proposed the creation of an alternative 
to the courts to settle civil cases involving the media. The establishment of an alternative 
dispute resolution mechanism is straightforward enough. There is nothing now to stop that 
happening:  indeed,  the  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from  Sir  Charles  Gray  in  relation  to  Early 
Resolution, which has done just that, although as noted earlier it has not proved popular so 
far with claimants.

12.3  The issue is not how to ensure that such systems exist, but how to make them sufficiently 
attractive to the press so as to encourage them to be part of a regime that provides access to 
them, and equally attractive to those who wish to commence proceedings against the press. 
The issues around civil litigation are examined in detail elsewhere in the Report298 and I do 
not propose to revisit them here. In this section I will simply consider the proposals that have 
been put forward to deal with them.

12.4  Lord Black suggests the possibility of establishing an ‘arbitral arm’ as a part of the model he 
proposes on behalf of the industry. However, this proposition is not worked up in any detail. 
It is clear that the value to the industry from this proposal would come principally from the 
ability to require complainants to use it.

12.5  The  Alternative  Libel  Project  submitted  a  proposal  based  around  a  new  press  regulator 

offering a voluntary arbitration service. The key elements of their proposal are: 299

(a) “increased use of mediation and arbitration;
(b) the introduction of Early Neutral Evalation;

1696

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK(c)  Costs  penalties  for  failing  to  use  these  three  forms  of  alternative  dispute 

resolution

(d) the  introduction  of  a  hearing  to  determine  the  meaning  of  an  alleged 

defamatory statement, with fixed limits on evidence, argument and costs;

(e) more robust case management;
(f)  a change in costs rules to protect a party from having to pay the other side’s 

costs in the event of losing, and the introduction of an overall costs cap.”

12.6  Under  this  model  the  regulator  could  offer  a  mediation  service,  with  any  unsettled  cases 
going on to court, an adjudication service, or an arbitration service where the findings would 
be final.300 The Alternative Libel Project supports voluntary ADR as part of a self-regulatory 
scheme which should be incentivised by costs orders made by the courts.301 They take this line 
because compelling people to use ADR would involve some form of statutory underpinning, 
which is opposed by Index on Censorship and English Pen as a form of statutory regulation.302

12.7  By contrast Sir Charles Gray and Early Resolution submitted to the Inquiry a proposal founded 
on a statutory adjudication scheme which both claimants and defendants are required to 
use. Early Resolution (ER) is a not-for-profit company set up in 2011 for the specific purpose 
of helping those engaged in expensive and complex libel or privacy litigation.303 The Objective 
of  ER  is  to  bring  about  a  fair,  rapid  and  cost-effective  resolution  of  disputes  involving  the 
media.304 Where both parties agree to arbitration, ER can resolve issues including, in relation 
to  defamation  the  meaning  of  the  publication  complained  of,  whether  the  words  are 
statement of fact or comment and the quantum of any damages. In relation to libel, ER can 
determine whether the defendant had infringed the claimant’s right to privacy, and, if so, to 
what extent, whether the defendant had a defence of public interest and any damages.305 The 
benefits of this scheme are described as its speed, privacy and cost effectiveness.306

12.8  Sir Charles’ proposal would be for a statutory regulator operating mediation for breaches of its 
code and statutory adjudication for disputes involving a claim for compensation.307 Under this 
system both claimants and defendants would be compelled to participate in the adjudication 
process.308

12.9  Hugh  Tomlinson  QC’s  proposal  on  behalf  of  the  Media  Regulation  Roundtable  postulated 
a  fully  integrated  regulatory  and  ADR  regime.  Under  this  scheme,  like  the  ER  proposal, 
all complaints against scheme members would go to the regulator in the first instance. A 
complaint in relation to a breach of the code would be the subject of mediation and could 
then go to a dispute resolution tribunal if the claimant was not satisfied. A complaint of a 
legal wrong would also start with mediation but, if that was unsuccessful, would then go 
to  a  compulsory  adjudication  process.  Any  attempt  to  bypass  the  adjudication  system  by 
going straight to court would result in the court action being stayed. The adjudicators would 
operate  a  stringent  filter  to  prevent  vexatious  or  hopeless  cases  being  brought.  The  case 
would be ruled on within 28 days and could be dealt with on the papers or after an oral

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Khearing. The adjudicator’s ruling would not be final or binding and could be challenged in the 
courts.309

12.10  Mr Mosley’s proposal would establish a Press Tribunal which would have jurisdiction in parallel 
with the High Court in respect of media cases. The Tribunal would operate by hearings in 
front of a single adjudicator, at very short notice if necessary. Lawyers would not be involved 
unless the complainant appointed one. The adjudicator would have no power to make orders 
for costs other than for wasted costs, but would have the power to award damages. Because 
the Tribunal would be operating as a regulator as well as an adjudicator it would also have 
regulatory sanctions and remedies available to it.310

12.11  There  is  much  to  be  said  for  an  effective  alternative  dispute  resolution  mechanism  that 
must be used by both complainants and defendants. I am struck by Sir Charles’ experience 
that complainants at present are not incentivised to use an ADR mechanism. That may well 
change with changes to the conditional fee agreements (CFAs). But making it more difficult 
for complainants to use CFAs will put the balance of power firmly back with the newspapers 
when it comes to court action, making an alternative route to justice of critical importance 
for ordinary individuals.

13.	 The	role	of	the	courts
13.1  Many of the proposals presented to the Inquiry envisage a role for the courts in some way. For 
the most part, this is related to the extent to which the courts could take into consideration 
any membership of a self-regulatory body when considering defamation and privacy cases, 
and the relationship between the courts and any ADR mechanism. I have considered both of 
these issues thoroughly in sections 5 and 12 respectively of this Chapter and I do not propose 
to revisit them here.

13.2  A few of the proposals envisage the courts having a role in enforcing the decisions of the 
regulatory body. Lord Black’s proposal on behalf of the industry relies on contacts between 
the  regulator  and  the  regulated  for  enforcement  of  any  regulatory  decisions.  The  only 
mechanism for enforcement in that situation is to seek an order from the courts for specific 
performance. Similarly the Media Regulation Roundtable proposal suggests that the power 
to apply sanctions would sit in a contract between the regulator and those regulated,311 and 
the regulator would therefore similarly have to rely on the courts to enforce a sanction if 
the  other  party  refused  to  comply  voluntarily.  The  Campaign  for  Broadcasting  and  Press 
freedom suggests that its proposed regulator should be able to apply to the courts for an 
order to enforce a ruling about publication of a correction or apology.312 Similarly Ms Harman 
envisages the courts enforcing fines for failure of a newspaper to comply with a ruling by 
a new regulatory body.313 In practice, there would be a potential enforcement role for the 
courts in relation to any statutory provision. In addition, the decisions and actions of any

mechanism was specifically provided for in the statute.

14.	 Costs	and	funding
14.1  Any  new  regulatory  regime  will  have  costs  and  those  costs  will  have  to  be  met  from 
somewhere.  This  gives  rise  to  three  separate  questions.  The  first  is  simply  affordability. 
How much will it cost, can adequate resources be found and, from where? The second is 
about adequacy. Any regulator can only be as effective as its resources allow it to be, so how 
can a new system ensure that the regulatory body has sufficient funding to act effectively, 
particularly recognising that all private and public sector budgets are under pressure in the 
current economic circumstances? Third, how can the regulator maintain genuine operational 
independence from its funding body or bodies? This encompasses the obvious point that a 
regulator should not be put under financial pressure in relation to any individual decision or 
decisions, but also that a funding body should not be able to influence the regulator’s overall 
approach in terms of how it organises its activities, sets its priorities or approaches its duties. 
This section is concerned only with the costs of a regulatory function (including complaint 
handling)  and  does  not  include  any  consideration  of  litigation  costs  in  relation  to  dispute 
resolution.

How much will it cost?

14.2  The only proposal presented to the Inquiry with any estimate of the cost was that of Lord 
Black. He estimated that the industry proposal would cost £2.25m per annum, together with 
(un-estimated) one-off transitional costs.314 Lord Black made it clear in oral evidence that this 
was  an  estimate  and  that  clarity  over  costs  remained  an  important  issue  for  the  industry. 
However, he said:315

“As always with the industry, if there is a case that is made out that more funding is 
needed, then the industry has always met it in the past. I think that we would need to 
sit down with the new regulator when that’s in place, when we have further costings, 
and look at these elements and how much they’re going to cost, but I have no doubt 
that sufficient funding will be made available to the regulator to fulfil its function.”

14.3  The MST helpfully calculates that the cost of the PCC and Pressbof in 2011 (just over £2m) 
amounted  to  approximately  0.05%  of  copy  sales  revenue  for  nationals  and  0.13%  for 
regionals.316 The MST also helpfully provides information on the costs of other self or co-
regulators in the UK and other press councils around the world, but I fear that this information 
is limited in value unless there is a clear comparison between the models.

14.4 

I have dealt above317 with suggestions that the PCC was unable to be effective because it was 
not sufficiently funded. Without being able to give a view myself on what level of funding 
would be appropriate for any particular model put forward I certainly would make that point 
that any system must be adequately funded to carry out all of its functions.

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry KWho should pay?

14.5  The first point to make is that none of the proposals presented to the Inquiry suggest that 
complainants should directly bear any part of the cost of a new regulatory regime. The NUJ 
expresses the point explicitly:318

“The body needs to be free for users at point of access so that there is no financial 
impediment to complaints about standards. The one small bit of praise for the PCC 
that is constantly and justly repeated is that it is fast and free. These are attributes 
that need to remain in a successor regulator…...”

The MediaWise Trust points out that, whilst there is no fee to access the PCC’s services at 
present, it cannot be considered to be ‘free’ to do so because the costs of, for example, se-
curing professional advice, or obtaining transcripts of inquests or court cases, can be signifi-
cant.319 Mr Mosley argues that it is essential that a tribunal should be available to both public 
and media free of charge.320

14.6  Lord Black makes it clear that his proposal would be fully funded by the industry. Indeed, he 

goes further and says that:321

“It would be inappropriate in a system of self regulation for the taxpayer to make 
any  contribution  through  state  funding,  and  the  industry  is  –  to  the  best  of  my 
understanding – wholly opposed to that.”

14.7  Others agree that the industry should be responsible for the full cost of a new regulatory 
system. Ms Harman considers a circulation based levy on publications.322 Mr Mosley, who 
also proposes the establishment of a statutory tribunal, proposes that it should be funded by 
a combination of fines levied on companies and:323

  “A  levy  of  ‘less  than  1p  (possibly  as  little  as  0.1p)  for  every  copy  distributed  of 
any  publication  with  a  circulation  exceeding  30,000.”324  The  Campaign  for  Press 
and Broadcasting Freedom argue for a levy on advertising revenues generated by 
the activities of the relevant groups. The levy would take into account the varying 
capacities of organisations to pay as well as overarching principles of fairness.

14.8  Mr  Mosley  asserts  that  a  1p  levy  on  newspaper  distribution  would  raise  about  £47.5m 
annually. Professor Greenslade says that publishers who sign up to the system will provide 
funds proportionate to the size of their circulations.325 The MST proposes a levy on all large 
news publishing organisations of 0.05% of revenues in order to fund its proposed Backstop

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKIndependent  Auditor.326  The  self-regulatory  bodies  would  be  (transparently)  funded  by 
members’ subscriptions.327

14.9  There is a significant body of opinion that state funding of some sort should be provided. This 
is particularly the case where the proposals envisage some form of statutory authority or 
powers for the new regulatory body. This ranges from those who would like to see a mix of 
public and industry funding to those who advocate a fully state funded solution.

14.10  The Carnegie Trust anticipates that the new regulatory regime is likely to be significantly more 

costly than the current regime and that the full cost should not be met by the industry:328

“Given  the  challenging  economic  and  market  conditions  facing  the  newspaper 
industry  at  present  this  could  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  sustainability  of  a 
number of news outlets – and this is not in the interests of citizens.”

The Trust therefore suggests that the industry should pay some of the increased cost of a new 
system but that there should also be additional public funding to support the activities of the 
new regulator.329 Similarly, the MediaWise Trust advocates a mix of public funds and contribu-
tions from the print and broadcasting companies, saying:330

“Just  because  public  money  is  involved  doesn’t  mean  that  control  transfers  to 
politicians.”

14.11  The NUJ tends towards the view that state funding may be the easiest way to ensure true 
independence, but also canvasses the idea of charging the companies complained of a case 
fee, with surcharges where complaints are upheld,331 although agreeing that one would have 
to be very careful about frivolous complaints. In giving oral evidence to the Inquiry Professor 
Frost said:332

“it’s certainly a possibility that if the new body became concerned that newspapers 
were wilfully ignoring complaints that had come to them first, that they could charge 
a fee, but I have to say it’s not my favoured option. I don’t think we would want to 
push that. It would be much more sensible for the new body to be funded either from 
the industry or from state funds or a mix of the two.”

14.12  The  CCMR,  having  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  statutory  tribunal,  suggests  that 

funding of the Tribunal should be through the courts and tribunals system.333

14.13  The Media Regulation Roundtable expects most funding to come from subscriptions from 
publishers joining their voluntary scheme. They also advocate the ‘polluter pays’ principle, 
suggesting  that  those  who  breached  the  code  would  be  expected  to  make  enhanced 
contributions.  Finally,  they  note  that  it  is  likely  that  an  element  of  state  funding  will  also 
be  required,  in  particular  to  cover  start  up  and  transition  costs.334  Sir  Louis  Blom-Cooper

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry Kenvisages that ‘substantial public funding’335 would be required for his vision of a statutory 
independent Press Commission.

14.14  It seems to me that a pragmatic solution is probably called for. It is important that the funding 
for any new system of press standards regulation should be sufficient to enable the job to be 
done properly. The press currently makes a contribution of just over £2m a year to fund the 
PCC and I can certainly see no reason why they should be called up on to pay any less towards 
a new system. I do, however, recognise that some parts of the industry are facing significant 
economic and market challenges and it is important to keep the burden on companies to a 
realistic and appropriate minimum. I see no objection in principle to public funds being used 
to help establish or run any system of regulation that depends on statute, although equally 
there is no reason why the industry should not meet the costs of any statutory regulation in 
this sector as they do in many others. Ultimately this must be a matter of judgment for the 
Government, having regard both to what is fair and to the ability of the industry and the 
public finances to contribute.

Adequacy and independence

14.15  Ofcom argues that:336

“Ensuring reasonable operational independence and appropriate scope could be best 
achieved through the application of fixed term funding settlements.”

Elaborating on this point in oral evidence Mr Richards made the point that a regulatory body 
requires financial security in order to be truly independent of its funding body:337

“If  you  have  established  to  public  satisfaction,  as  it  were,  all  of  the  things  that 
Colette  was  talking  about  a  few  moments  ago,  in  other  words  your  governance 
and independence framework, that in reality is not going to go very far if actually 
someone is controlling the purse strings on a regular basis and in effect can infer or 
imply that resourcing or money may be withheld or changed in one form or another 
should decisions be made which are not the ones that may be preferred, and I think 
this is extremely important. I think a very important dimension of independence and 
effectiveness is financial security. You can’t have an in perpetuity arrangement, and 
I think we suggest a multi-year period, I think we might mention somewhere three 
or four years, such that there is a moment when a proper exercise takes place which 
asks  what  is  the  necessary  funding  for  the  body?  And  that’s  about  efficiency  and 
value for money. But after that, there should not be interference with that budget, to 
ensure that the operational daily decision-making is not subject to any risk, any risk 
of threat or intimidation or anything of that kind.”

14.16  The difficulty of ensuring independence of the regulator from the body funding it was made 

by Professor Greenslade:338

“If you just take funding, for a start. Funding is not a sort of joke thing. If you pull that 
lever, you constrain that lever, you control. And so I would be really worried about the

reborn, and I think that’s a problem. I thought his phrase about independently led 
self-regulation was beautifully put. It’s actually in his submission too. But what we’re 
really aiming for, are we not, is independently led independent regulation.”

14.17  Mr Suter proposes a model in which regulation is carried out by approved self-regulatory 
organisations.  In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  maintaining  the  independence  of  the 
regulator from its funding body, he suggests that one of the three essential criteria against 
which a self-regulatory body should be assessed should be that the operational and funding 
arrangements are sufficient to fulfil their role.339

14.18  I agree with Mr Richards and Professor Greenslade on this point. It is essential that any new 
regulatory body should have both security and independence of funding. I agree that this will 
mean that fixed term funding agreements should be reached to enable the regulatory body 
to manage its affairs as it sees fit without undue pressure or interference from the funding 
body, whether the funding comes from the industry or from Government, or both.

15.	 Protection	and	promotion	of	freedom	of	expression
15.1  A number of the submissions put to the Inquiry suggest that any new regulatory regime should 
include a positive role in relation to protection and promotion of freedom of expression or 
freedom of the press.

15.2  Ofcom starts from the position that there should be a clear statement of the public purposes 

of any regulatory system, and that the first of those purposes should be:340

“a requirement to protect the rights of the press in relation to freedom of expression.”

The Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom proposes that the aims of its proposed 
Media Standards and Freedom Council should include:341

“To  promote  both  the  free  dissemination  of  news  and  information  in  the  public 
interest, and professional and ethical standards.”

The CCMR proposes that the Board of its News Publishing Commission would have a respon-
sibility to monitor and champion press freedom.342 The MST identifies six key objectives for its 
proposed Backstop Independent Auditor, one of which is to protect and promote reporting 
in the public interest.343

15.3  Mr Tomlinson QC, on behalf of the Media Regulation Roundtable, proposes a ‘Media Freedom 
and Standards Act’, which would include a provision, modelled on s3 of the Constitutional 
Reform  Act 2005, which  would  place  a  duty  on  the  relevant  Secretary  of  State and  other

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry KMinisters of the Crown to uphold the freedom of the press and its independence from the 
executive.344 His suggestion is in these terms:

“GUARANTEE OF MEDIA FREEDOM
(1) The  Secretary  of  State  for  Culture,  Olympics,  Media  and  Sport  and  other 
Ministers of the Crown and all with responsibility for matters relating to the 
media must uphold the freedom of the press and its independence from the 
executive.

(2) The  Secretary  of  State  for  Culture,  Olympics,  Media  and  Sport  must  have 

regard to:
(a) the importance of the freedom and integrity of the media;
(b) the right of the media and the public to receive and impart information 

without interference by public authorities;

(c) the need to defend the independence of the media.

(3) Interference with the activities of the media shall be lawful only insofar as it 
is for a legitimate purpose and is necessary in a democratic society, having full 
regard to the importance of media freedom in a democracy.”

15.4  Mr Tomlinson explained the intension behind, and anticipated effect of, this proposal:345

“It’s partly intended as a statement of, as it were, quasi-constitutional principle. Like 
the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental constitutional principle, so the 
independence of the media should be as well. What that means in practice is that 
if  the  Secretary  of  State  of  is  making  decisions  which  will  impact  on  the  way  the 
media operates, the Secretary of State must be guided by this principle. And there 
are circumstances in which one could envisage situations where that would force the 
Secretary of State to go in one direction rather than another.”

15.5  Lord  Prescott  does  not  advocate  an  explicit  role  defending  freedom  of  expression  but  he 
argues that any new framework should expressly require any regulator to have regard to case 
law under the ECHR and the HRA.346

15.6  Ms  Harman  states  that  the  Labour  Party  believes  that  any  Bill  establishing  a  new  system 
should also include constitutional safeguards for the freedom of the press.347 She goes on to 
suggest that this might be done via the introduction of a statutory public interest defence. 
Ms Harman is not alone in arguing for a public interest defence, which is raised by the MST, 
Hacked Off, MediaWise, the Coordinating Committee for Media Reform, Max Mosley, Roy 
Greenslade and the Media Regulation Roundtable.

15.7 

I  have  dealt  earlier348  with  the  problems  associated  with  the  creation  of  statutory  public 
interest defences in criminal law and I will not revisit that here.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK16.	 Protection	of	journalists

Whistleblowing and a conscience clause

16.1  Lord Hunt suggested that a new regulatory structure should have a whistleblowing hotline349 
and the CCMR recommends that the new regulatory body should establish a whistleblower 
code.350

16.2  The NUJ makes a strong case that there should be some protection for journalists who are 
put  under  pressure  to  behave  unethically.  To  this  end,  it  recommends  that  all  journalists’ 
contracts should include a ‘Conscience Clause’ to prevent a journalist from being dismissed 
for a refusal to breach ethical standards:351

“A journalist has the right to refuse assignments or be identified as the creator of 
editorial  which  would  break the letter of  [sic] the spirit  of  the Code.  No journalist 
should be disciplined or suffer detriment to their career for asserting his/her rights to 
act according to the Code.”

16.3  Specifically  the  NUJ  recommends  that  a  new  standards  code  should  include  a  provision 
requiring  the  inclusion  of  such  a  clause  in  journalists’  contracts.  The  CCMR  argued  that  a 
news  standards  code  should  itself  include  a  conscience  clause  supporting  journalists  who 
refuse to work in ways that breach the code of practice.352 Similarly Professor Greenslade 
argues  for  the  inclusion  of  a  conscience  clause  within  the  code  and  for  the  protection  of 
journalists who act as whistleblowers or who invoke the conscience clause.353

16.4  When this was put to Rupert Murdoch as a suggestion he agreed that a conscience clause 

along those lines in employment contracts would be a good idea:354

“Q:  Are  you  aware  that  the  NUJ  has  for  a  long  time  been  seeking  the  insertion 
in  contracts  of  employment,  not  just  at  News  International  but  other  titles,  of  a 
conscience clause, that’s to say a provision by which it is forbidden to discipline a 
journalist  who  refuses  to  do  something  which  is  unethical  or  against  the  code  of 
practice?
A.  I have never heard of it.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Do you think it’s a good idea?
A.  Yes. I think – I wouldn’t do it through the NUJ, but I think for –
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: No, but the clause.
A.  For us to say as a condition of employment in a contract for a journalist they have 
the right to do that, I think that’s a good idea.”

16.5  Professor  Chris  Frost  raised  the  issue  of  the  position  of  journalists  in  relation  to  moral 
rights.  Essentially,  the  Berne  Convention  requires  recognition  of  two  inalienable  rights  of 
authors in literary and artistic works. The first is the right (even after transfer of copyright) 
to claim authorship of a work (‘the paternity right’) and the section is the right to object 
to  any  distortion,  mutilation  or  other  modification  of  a  work  which  would  be  prejudicial 
to the author’s honour or reputation (the ‘integrity right’).355 Under the Copyright Designs 
and  Patents  Act  1998  (CDPA),  these  rights  do  not  apply  in  relation  to  any  work  made  for 
the purpose of reporting current events or in relation to a literary work made available for 
publication  in  a  newspaper,  magazine  or  similar  periodical.356  Professor  Frost  argued  that 
these moral rights should be extended to cover journalistic work:357

“So I can prevent material being published under my byline if I disagree with it. In 
this instance, if I think it’s unethical. Equally, I could argue about material that I had 
written being changed to make it unethical. That doesn’t stop a newspaper publishing 
it  without  a  byline  or  with  what’s  known  as  a  cod-byline,  an  invented  byline  of  a 
fictional person, but it does mean that it wouldn’t be there under my byline and that’s 
quite important to a number of journalists who have become very upset – quite rightly 
so – when stories are changed or completely rewritten or a headline is put on the top 
of them which does not reflect what they wrote and what they know to be accurate 
and ethical.”

16.6  Given that this was a new issue that had not been raised before the Inquiry before, I invited 
press Core Participants to make submissions on the matter; two, the Telegraph Media Group 
(TMG) and News International (NI) did so. Both advanced similar arguments. The exemptions 
in  the  CDPA  had  been  inserted  into  the  Bill  that  subsequently  became  the  CDPA.  News 
International provided evidence that:358

“It  was  reported  to  the  House  of  Lords  in  the  course  of  the  debates  that  the 
government had received many representations about the dire effect of moral rights 
on  newspapers,  particularly,  it  seems,  from  the  editor  of  the  Economist,  who  had 
given  evidence  to  the  committee.  Lord  Lloyd  of  Hampstead  said  that:  “intolerable 
complications  would  be  created  if  it  were  applied  to  newspapers,  magazines  and 
composite works”. Lord McGregor, a Labour spokesman and former Chairman of the 
Royal Commission on the Press, concluded that “The exercise of moral rights in such 
circumstances would have posed a threat to an editor’s right to edit and would have 
emasculated his responsibility for the form and content of his newspaper.”
Lord Hemingford stated: “allowing a reporter the right to insist on being identified or 
not to suffer alteration to what he has written or possibly dictated over the telephone 
from notes would be unrealistic and impractical in a newspaper context.””

16.7  TMG argued that to require either the paternity right or the integrity right would delay the 
news and be wholly impractical for the newspapers to operate.359 TMG felt that it was not 
clear  whether  Professor  Frost  was  arguing  for  the  repeal  of  the  exemption  provisions  for

the context in which he raised the issue was that of integrity but that a combination of both 
rights, namely a right to assert authorship and a right to prevent ‘distortion, mutilation or 
other modification’ of a work, would indeed be problematic in a newspaper environment. 
It is less clear to me that allowing the integrity right on its own would cause the problems 
complained of by TMG and NI. If a journalist retained his integrity right but not his paternity 
right then, in any case where a publisher needed to make changes to a text and did not have 
time to seek the permission of the author, they could simply remove the attribution. I am 
not, however, clear that this would be a desirable outcome for journalists, who might find 
themselves systematically denied attribution as a precautionary measure where articles have 
been edited after submission.

16.8  NI also drew my attention to the 2009 consultation by the UK Intellectual Property Office, 
resulting in a policy statement that the Government does not propose to alter the UK’s moral 
rights regime. Whilst this consultation did indeed consider the position of moral rights in the 
UK, it did so only in the context of proposed changes in relation to orphan works and the 
possibility of introducing an exception in relation to parody.360 I do not, therefore, consider 
that  this  constitutes  a  recent  consideration  by  the  Government  of  the  issues  raised  by 
Professor Frost. NI further submitted that the Inquiry should not consider recommending the 
repeal of a statutory provision founded on a thorough debate without receiving full evidence 
on the implications of such a repeal. 361

16.9 

I recognise the real force of this point and I do not feel that I have heard enough evidence on 
the matter to reach a fixed conclusion. I do, however, think that this is an issue that is worth 
looking at further. I would, therefore, encourage the Government to find an early opportunity 
to consult on it, with a view to identifying whether removing the exemptions for reporting on 
current affairs and material provided for publication in a newspaper or journal in relation to 
either or both of paternity and integrity rights would improve protection of journalists and 
journalistic standards.

Chapter 4 | Other Proposals Submitted to the Inquiry KChapter 5 
InternatIonal Comparators

1.  the press Council of Ireland and the press 

ombudsman

1.1 

1.2 

History and background
The Irish Press Council and Ombudsman system was set up in 2007 as a direct response to 
the threat of legislation from the Irish Government. The Chair of the Press Council, Daithí 
O’Ceallaigh, described the agreement eventually reached between the Government and the 
industry as:1

“a win-win solution….[where] at least some of the changes in defamation law sought 
by the industry would be incorporated in a new Act and, in return, the industry would 
sponsor  an  independent  Press  Council  and  Press  Ombudsman  along  lines  broadly 
acceptable to government.”

In the mid 1990s the Irish Government set up a Commission on the newspaper industry; in 
1996, that body recommended the establishment of a Press Ombudsman, but no action was 
taken.2 Then in 2002, the Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, set up an expert advisory 
group which reported in 2003 with a recommendation for a statutory system of regulation for 
the press.3 The industry set up a steering committee to consider its response; this committee 
included  representatives  of  all  the  major  newspaper  groups  in  Ireland,  including  some  of 
those based in the UK, namely News International and Trinity Mirror.4 This group ultimately 
developed a model for the Press Council, which was to be independent of Government and, 
in its operations, independent of the industry; this was the model that was adopted for the 
new Council and Ombudsman in the summer of 2007. 

1.3 

Professor John Horgan, the Irish Press Ombudsman, explained to the Inquiry his understanding 
that the Press Council had been established with the quid pro quo that that Government 
would withdraw its proposals for the statutory regulation of the press.5 At the same time, 
the Government agreed to use the legislative opportunity provided by the Defamation Bill in 
2009 to offer some statutory underpinning for the new Council.6 

1.4 

Professor Horgan made it clear that the industry considered there to be a very real threat 
that the Government would legislate for press regulation in the absence of an adequate self-
regulatory solution:7 

 “LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But behind it all, do I gather from what you were saying 
somewhat earlier, was the threat of statutory regulation?

KA.  Absolutely.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So in other words, it behoved the press interests to come up 
with a solution that was less than the club that was being held over them?
A.  That is absolutely the case. And in fact my membership, or our membership of the 
Alliance of Independent Press Councils of Europe indicates that in quite a few countries 
this  threat  has  been  the  engine  which  has  generated  or  promoted  the  successful 
establishment of press councils of the same kind in many European countries.
So  even  though  before  this  threat  was  made,  there  had  been  moves  towards  the 
establishment of something like this, the 1996 report of the commission, which wasn't 
under such a threat, recommended the establishment of an ombudsman. As I said, it 
was the real and present danger of that that created the situation in which we found 
ourselves.”

1.5 

Legal recognition
In practice the Defamation Act 2009 set out some fairly detailed requirements for the structure, 
coverage and operation of a Press Council before it could be recognised under the legislation; 
this meant that, whilst the detail of both the code of practice and the complaints mechanism 
were left to the industry to set, the broad framework was dictated by the legislation if the 
industry wanted to take advantage of the protection offered by the Act. Professor Horgan 
told the Inquiry:

“without  the  benefit  of  knowledge  of  what  went  on  behind  closed  doors  in  the 
four years leading up to the creation of the Press Council, it might be thought that 
this legislation represents a framework imposed by the state on the private sector. 
Whereas in fact – and Professor Thomas Mitchell has briefed me extensively on this – 
by and large the provisions relating to the Press Council that found their place in the 
Defamation Act were those proposed by the Press Council itself to the government.”

There is  scope  within  the  Act for  the  industry  collectively  to  decide  not  to  create a  Press 
Council, and for any individual journal to decide not to participate. However, the Press Council 
of Ireland, as currently constituted, was established before the Act came into force and all 
significant publishers of newspapers in Ireland are members of the Council.8

1.6 

Benefits
The Act provides a defence of ‘fair and reasonable publication’ to a defamation action.9 In 
the case of a statement published in a periodical by a person who at the time of publication 
was a member of the Press Council, a court in considering whether publication was fair and 
reasonable may take into account the extent to which the person adhered to the code of 
standards of the Press Council and abided by determinations of both the Press Ombudsman 
and the Press Council.10 There was, as yet, no case law on this.11 Professor Horgan clarified 
that this did not mean that the defence was only available to those who had signed up to the 
system. The defence was also available, in theory, to other publications if they could satisfy

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsKthe court that they operated to standards and procedures in no way inferior to those of the 
Council. Similarly, this had not been tested in court and Professor Horgan said:12

“My  honest  view  it  that  it  would  be  quite  difficult  for  publications  that  are  not 
members of the Council to satisfy a court that they operate to such standards.”

1.7 

1.8 

In  order  to  enact  these  benefits,  the  Act  makes  provision  for  the  Minister,  by  order,  to 
recognise a body as “the Press Council” for the purposes of the Act. The requirements for 
recognition are specific and detailed and it is worth setting them out here to show the extent 
to which the Defamation Act establishes the objectives and the structural independence of 
the Press Council, the approach to dealing with complaints and the overarching coverage of 
the code of standards. 

Only  one  Press  Council  may  be  recognised  at  any  one  time.  Before  the  Press  Council  can 
be recognised the Minister must satisfy himself that it meets the specifications set out in 
Schedule 2 to the Act. He can revoke the recognition at any time he considers that the Press 
Council fails to meet the specifications in the Schedule.13 So far this power has been used 
once, in April 2010, to recognise the Press Council of Ireland as ‘the Press Council’.

1.9 

Schedule 2 of the Act requires that the Press Council should have the principle objectives of:14

“(a) ensuring the protection of freedom of expression of the press,
(b) protecting  the  public  interest  by  ensuring  ethical,  accurate  and  truthful 

reporting by the press,

(c)  maintaining certain minimum ethical and professional standards among the 

press,

(d) ensuring that the privacy and dignity of the individual is protected.”

Interestingly, Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that the primary purpose of the Press Council 
was:15

“to  maintain  the  rights  of  the  press  to  freedom  of  expression,  to  maintain  the 
independence  of  the  press  from  the  State  and  State  control  or  regulation  and  to 
decide on appeals against decisions or the Press Ombudsman on complaints.”

with the primary role of the Press Ombudsman being:16

“to  receive  and  adjudicate  on  complaints,  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  work 
of his Office and of the Council, and to encourage and promote the highest ethical 
standards of journalism in Ireland.”

Meanwhile, the website of the Press Council says that the objectives of the Press Council 
are:17

•  “To  provide  the  public  with  an  independent  forum  for  resolving  complaints 

about the press.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK•  To resolve all complaints quickly, fairly and free of charge. 
•  To  defend  the  freedom  of  the  press  and  the  freedom  of  the  public  to  be 

informed.”

1.10  Specific  provision  is  made  in  the  Act  about  the  structure  of  the  Council,  the  number  of 
members  and  how  many  of  those  members  should  independently  represent  the  public 
interest,  the  interests  of  owners  and  publishers,  and  of  journalists.18  The  Schedule  makes 
requirements about the independence of the appointments procedures; it requires that the 
Minister should be satisfied by the independence of the appointments procedure but gives 
him no role in establishing or operating it.19

1.11  Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that it was clear to the industry when they were formulating 

their proposals for the Council that:20

“one  critical  aspect  of  what  the  industry  proposed  to  establish,  without  which  no 
possible measure of Government acceptance or approval would have been available, 
was independence.”

1.12 

It is a requirement of the Act that the Press Council should be funded by subscribing journals 
and should receive no funding from other sources.21 

1.13  The Act requires that the Press Council should appoint a body (the Press Ombudsman) to 
resolve complaints about the conduct of its members. The Press Ombudsman is to have the 
power to require publication of its own decisions, corrections, retractions and “such other 
action as the Ombudsman may, in the circumstances, deem appropriate”. Decisions of the 
Ombudsman are to be appealable to the Press Council itself, which is to have similar powers 
in respect of requiring publication of decisions.22

1.14  The Press Council must have adopted a code of practice with which all members are required 

to comply; this includes:23

“(a) ethical standards and practices,
(b) rules  and  standards  intended  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of  reporting  where  a 

person’s reputation is likely to be affected, and

(c)  rules and standards intended to ensure that intimidation and harassment of 
persons does not occur and that the privacy, integrity and dignity of the person 
is respected.”

The Press Council 

1.15  The Council was created by the Press Industry Steering Committee, comprising the publishing 

trade associations and the NUJ, in accordance with the provisions set out in the Act.

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsKAppointments 

1.16  The Act requires the Press Council to comprise 13 members, of whom seven are independent 
members  representing  the  public  interest,  five  represent  the  interest  of  owners  and 
publishers and one represents the interest of journalists.24 The public interest members are 
appointed by an independent four-person Appointments Committee, on the basis of public 
advertisement and interview.25 The Chair of the Council is appointed from within the public 
interest members, although in practice external applications have also been invited.26 The 
industry and journalist members are nominated by the various organisations that took part in 
the steering committee and the Appointments Committee ratifies the nominations. Professor 
Horgan explained that there was not an automatic guarantee of appointment for those who 
were  nominated,  but  he  could  not  readily  foresee  a  situation  in  which  such  nominations 
would not be ratified.27

1.17  The first Appointments Committee was appointed by the Press Industry Steering Committee. 
Subsequent appointments to the Committee are made by the Press Council. The appointments 
are for three years; that first Committee was subsequently re-appointed for a second three 
year term by the Council in July 2010.28 As of August 2010, the Chair of the Council was also 
the Chair of the Appointments Committee.29

1.18  The  five  industry  members  of  the  Press  Council  are  current  senior  editorial  executives, 
although not usually editors. The only serving editor currently on the Council is the editor of 
a regional publication; he fills the slot effectively reserved for regional newspaper editors.30 
Professor Horgan suggested that the absence of serving editors has worked well for the Press 
Council,  particularly  because  he  thought  that  there  was  more  change  of  personnel  than 
might be expected if editors were to hold the seats. The appointments are for a three year 
term, and can be extended for a second term; however, some four and a half years into the 
Council’s existence, only one of the original industry representatives is still a member of the 
Council.31

1.19  Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that the public interest majority on the Council was essential 
to the public acceptance of the independence of the model.32 He also regarded the presence 
of a journalist member on the Council alongside the industry members as essential.33 

1.20 

Structures and Funding 
In line with the requirements of the Defamation Act, the Press Council is wholly funded by 
the press industry. The finances of both the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman are 
provided by the Administrative Committee of the Press Council; the Committee is chaired 
by an independent member of the Council but otherwise consists of representatives of the 
different  types  of  publications  covered,  together  with  the  NUJ.  Each  title  covered  by  the 
Council pays a levy based on circulation.34

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK1.21  Making a complaint is free to the complainant.35

The Code

1.22  The code was originally drawn up in 2007 by the Steering Committee. There is now a Code 
Committee, which is chaired by an independent retired journalist and comprises nominees of 
the industry bodies. Serving editors have the right to be on the Committee but, for the most 
part,  they  are  represented  by  deputies  or  senior  executives.  The  Ombudsman  sits  on  the 
committee in an ex-officio capacity.36 Any changes to the Code are made in consultation with 
the Council. The Council can also suggest changes to the Code Committee. There have not, 
in fact, been any significant changes since the code was originally drafted.37 It may be worth 
noting that the code would have been available to the Government to see when formulating 
the terms of the 2009 Defamation Act.

Coverage

1.23  All national newspapers, including all the UK papers that are published in Ireland, and over 
90% of regional newspapers, are members of the Press Council. Around 60%, by number, of 
periodicals are members of the Council, but this would account for considerably more than 
60% of circulation as the larger magazines are members.38 Since the creation of the Council no 
members have left, or threatened to leave, the system.39 Recently a news website has applied 
for membership and the Council is considering the appropriate criteria for membership of 
web media.40

Public awareness and satisfaction

1.24  Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that public awareness of the Press Council and Ombudsman 
was limited. A public awareness campaign had been launched in an attempt to make the 
services provided by the Ombudsman more widely known.41 

Impact of statute on freedom of speech and the public interest

1.25  Professor Horgan did not think that the statutory recognition afforded to the Press Council 
by the Defamation Act constituted a limitation on the freedom of expression because the 
limitations in the Act were, by and large, those proposed and endorsed by the industry itself 
as a necessary balancing of the right to publish against the rights of individuals.42 The belief 
of the Council in the importance of the freedom of the press is reasserted in the preamble to 
the Code.43

1.26 

In this context it is worth noting that all UK titles that publish in Ireland are members of the 
Council; they do not appear to allow any principled objections to statutory underpinning of 
press self-regulation to get in the way of constructive and willing participation in this system.

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsK1.27  The public interest is not defined in the code, and it is left up to the Council and the Ombudsman 

to interpret it on a case by case basis. The code does set out a general principle:44 

“that the public interest is invoked in relation to a matter capable of affecting the 
people at large so that they may legitimately be interested in receiving and the press 
legitimately interested in providing information about it.”

The Press Ombudsman 

1.28  The Press Ombudsman primarily receives and adjudicates on complaints. The Ombudsman 
is appointed by the Press Council and reports to the Council on a monthly basis in respect 
of administrative matters.45  The Ombudsman is independent of the Council in the execution 
of his functions of investigation and adjudication, but his decisions can be appealed to the 
Council by either the complainant or the newspaper if they are dissatisfied.46  Professor Horgan 
stressed that his contract guarantees his independence from the Council and that the Council 
had recently agreed to amend its articles of association to give him greater independence. In 
particular the Ombudsman now has discretion to make decisions on whether someone is a 
person directly affected, and to rule out vexatious and frivolous complaints.47

Complaints

1.29  Complaints can only be made in respect of publications that are members of the Press Council 
of Ireland. A complaint can relate to any article that breaches the Code of Practice or to the 
behaviour of a journalist that breaches the Code.48

1.30  Complainants are expected to go in the first instance to the publisher concerned, and the 
Ombudsman will only consider complaints if the complainant has not received a satisfactory 
reply within two weeks.49 Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that he had:

“got a very severe telling off, which I think in the circumstances was quite justified, 
from the editor of the newspaper concerned…..”

when he had, on one occasion taken a compliant directly at the request of the complainant 
who had been too fearful to confront the newspaper itself.50

1.31  Complainants are free to take their cases to court in advance of, alongside or after a case 
is  considered  by  the  Ombudsman.  The  Ombudsman  will  not  consider  a  case  while  it  is 
before a court, but will suspend consideration of the complaint until legal proceedings have 
concluded.51 Professor Horgan could only recall one example of a complainant having taken 
legal action in respect of a matter which had already been adjudicated by him.52

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKProcess

1.32  The  Ombudsman  will  generally  carry  out  conciliation  and  reach  conclusions  on  the  basis 
of documentation alone, although there is also provision for face-to-face mediation, which 
may be used more often in future.53 All decisions, whether by the Press Ombudsman or, on 
appeal, by the Press Council, are published to the interested parties and on the Press Council/
Ombudsman website.54 An annual report is published setting out the data and the approach 
taken to key issues. 

1.33 

Volume and results
In the four years of its operation the Irish Press Ombudsman has received on average between 
340-350 complaints per year. This is roughly analogous, in proportion to population, to the 
number received by the PCC. There is, however, one striking difference between the outcomes 
from the Irish Ombudsman and those from the PCC. The Irish Press Ombudsman has reached 
a decision on nearly 12% of the complaints brought to it over its four year lifetime, which 
compares to substantially less then 1% of complaints to reach adjudication with the PCC.55 In 
2010 and 2011 around two thirds of the decisions of the Press Ombudsman have included 
a finding that the code was breached, with sufficient remedial action already having been 
taken by the publisher in up to half of those cases.56 Comparatively few cases are conciliated, 
with only 19 (6% and 5.5% respectively) conciliated in each of 2010 and 2011.57 

Appeals 

1.34  Either party to a complaint can appeal the decision of the Press Ombudsman to the Press 
Council. Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that there were a substantial number of appeals in 
the early years but that only very few appeals were upheld by the Press Council.58 The figures 
provided to the Inquiry show that 53% of the decisions taken by the Press Ombudsman have 
been appealed to the Council over the four years. There was a substantial dip in the level of 
appeals in 2009, but otherwise the proportion of decisions appealed has been over 50% in 
every year of the Press Ombudsman’s operation. It is not obvious from the figures whether 
those appeals were by publishers or claimants and Professor Horgan told the Inquiry:59

“Initially  quite  a  substantial  number  of  my  decisions  would  have  been  appealed, 
either by newspapers or by complainants, on the grounds that, well, it was free and, 
you know, why not have a second bite at the cherry?”

Very few of these appeals are upheld, however, with only three appeals having been upheld 
in four years (although some 12 appeals are described as being still outstanding).60

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsKStandards

1.35  The Ombudsman deals with individual cases and has no remit to identify or respond to any 
systemic issues which might become apparent from cases that he considers. Professor Horgan 
told us this would be a matter for the Press Council, on the basis of its own assessment of the 
issues before the Ombudsman and the decisions being reached. However, the Press Council 
does not have the power to conduct own-initiative investigations, and has no specific remit to 
tackle serious or systemic problems. Some efforts have been made to address systemic issues 
by, for example, sponsoring seminars on relevant matters.61

Sanctions

1.36  The only sanction available to the Press Ombudsman is the requirement for the newspaper 
or magazine to publish a decision upholding a complaint.62 Professor Horgan told the Inquiry 
that all the major newspapers have been the subject of critical adverse findings in one form 
or  another.63  Decisions  of  the  Press  Ombudsman  also  frequently  include  a  correction  of 
inaccurate facts.64 Detailed guidelines have been adopted by the Council in relation to the 
publication of a decision by the Press Ombudsman. In relation to prominence of publication 
these guidelines say:65

“(3)  Those  sections  of  decisions  of  the  Press  Ombudsman  upholding  a  complaint 
should be published: (a) in full; (b) promptly; (c) on the same page as the original 
article, or further forward, subject to the exception at (6) below; (d) on the same day 
of the week as the original publication, (e) with similar prominence; (f) unedited; and 
(g) without editorial commentary by way of a headline or otherwise. In addition, each 
should carry, above the headline, a strap-line indicating that it is a decision of the 
Press Ombudsman.
[….]
(6)  Where  a  complaint  has  been  upheld  in  relation  to  an  article  published  on  the 
front page of a publication, the decision should be published with due prominence on 
one of the first four editorial pages.”

UK titles as members

1.37  Professor Horgan told the Inquiry that UK titles accounted for 30% of membership of the 
Council, but were responsible for around 22% of the complaints. These figures have to be 
viewed with caution, however, as they make no allowance for circulation figures or other 
differences between titles.66 In respect of the types of complaint that were received about UK 
titles and Irish titles, Professor Horgan said:67

“There’s absolutely no discernable differentiation between the basis of the complaints 
against indigenous publications and those against UK-based publications.”

any of the publications with the Ombudsman.68

2.	 Other	models	of	press	regulation:	Europe	and	beyond
In  this  section  I  consider  systems  of  press  regulation  operated  in  Europe  and  elsewhere; 
2.1 
whether they are comparable to conditions in the UK and whether there are lessons that 
might  be  learnt  and  applied.  It  is  important  to  start  by  noting  that,  while  there  may  be 
similarities between systems of press regulation, no two systems are the same and there are 
important differences.

2.2  While all of those countries in consideration here operate systems of self-regulation, they 
differ from the PCC in many ways. In some cases, notably Denmark, Sweden, Finland and 
Germany,  there  is  some  form  of  involvement  by  government,  either  through  statute  or 
because of financial support; in the case of France, the impact of legislation is very different 
to the model in the UK and has real impacts upon the functioning of the press in that country.

2.3  Most of the comparative European countries operate a form of self-regulation through a Press 
Council, but also in some cases a Press Ombudsman (notably in Sweden). Unsurprisingly, the 
majority of the Press Councils operating in Europe and internationally, have been established 
solely  with  the  printed  press  in  mind.  The  development  of  new  media,  such  as  online 
publications and micro-blogging sites, have created opportunities for Press Councils to review 
existing frameworks, in order to consider options for incorporating new media platforms into 
their regulatory structure. This has included consideration of how to encourage membership, 
as well as how to meet the expectations for new media platforms and additional sources of 
funding for the system of regulation.69 By way of example, Denmark operates a ‘polluter pays’ 
policy for online members who have joined the Press Council. However, this is regarded as a 
temporary measure, as no official funding mechanism has yet been developed.70 Online and 
the self-regulatory settlement with online publishers is considered as and where appropriate 
in this section. 

2.4 

This section will also look at the composition of the Press Council Boards, as well as sources of 
funding for the industry; both are important variables. The German Press Council for example 
is co-funded by the German Government. This system has not led to statutory regulation; 
neither  has  it  been  suggested  that  the  Government  exerts  a  deleterious  influence  simply 
because of the public funding. In her extremely well informed evidence to the Inquiry, Lara 
Fielden, a Visiting Fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, has suggested 
that, although many of the European Press Councils profess to focus on the embedding and 
maintenance of journalistic standards, in practice this role is limited and most Press Councils 
are reactive and complaints driven instead.71

2.5 

I  will  first  consider  the  Scandinavian  countries  and  thereafter  Germany,  France  and  the 
Netherlands. I will then pass on briefly to review the situation in both the United States and 
China.

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsK2.6 

2.7 

Denmark, Sweden and Finland
The press in the Scandinavian countries has been described as a collective press which has 
historically prided itself on the publication of information to high standards of accuracy, and 
within the boundaries set by a clear journalistic code. In each of the Scandinavian countries, 
the respective Press Council has powers to raise monetary contributions and, if an article 
is found to breach the code, to mandate the publication of the fact of a breach along with 
an apology. Furthermore, in Denmark, the Press Council additionally has the ability (rarely 
used) to fine or imprison an editor-in-chief who fails to comply with a publication of a Council 
adjudication.72 As to the relevance of rights of individuals, the Swedish Code of Standards 
includes the clause that journalists should:73 

“Refrain from publicity which could violate the privacy of individuals, unless the public 
interest obviously demands public scrutiny”. 

Ms  Fielden  explained  that  the  tabloid  press  in  the  Scandinavian  countries  had  become 
increasingly comfortable with reporting on the private lives of politicians and others.74 

Significantly, there are no press laws in place, nor specific legislation relating to the regulation 
of the printed press, in Denmark, Sweden or Finland. However, contrary to assertions made 
in evidence and in public over the course of this Inquiry, there are elements of governmental 
involvement  that  can  be  found  in  the  systems  of  press  self-regulation  operated  in  these 
Scandinavian countries. For example, and most notably, the Danish Press Council is established 
in statute, pursuant to the Danish Media Liability Act 1998, albeit that other elements of the 
system are self-regulatory particularly in terms of handling adjudications, the composition of 
the Press Council Board and the exercise of Council responsibilities. Under the terms of the 
Act, all publications which are in printed circulation more than twice a year, as well as holders 
of broadcast licences, are subject to regulation by the Danish Press Council. The Council also 
deals with complaints across all media platforms, including online media, provided (in the 
case of online publishers) that these organisations are registered with the Council. 

2.8  Ms Fielden has explained that registration in Scandinavia is the expectation and is not perceived 
as a form of licensing.75 Indeed, it is compulsory for any publisher seeking to participate in 
the self-regulatory system in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The procedure of registering an 
editor-in-chief responsible for the publication is representative of the Scandinavian approach 
to responsible and accurate journalism.

72  Lara Fielden notes that a prison sentence has never been passed, although in the 1990s, a number of fines were 
imposed
73  p80, lines 1-3, Lara Fielden, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-
Afternoon-Hearing-13-July-20121.pdf
74  pp67-68, lines 24-3, Lara Fielden, ibid. This may be borne out by the reaction to the publication in France of the 
pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge (see Part F Chapter 7(7) and, in relation to the French publication, footnote 99 
below. The Swedish magazine, Se och Hör (See and Hear), and the titles’ sister Danish edition (similarly titled Se og 
Hør) both published the photographs within 24 hours of the injunction being granted. The editor-in-chief of Se och 
Hör defended the publication, saying that there had been nothing unusual about the publication of topless celebrities 
in their title. On Newsnight (19 September 2012), she did not deny they may have breached the privacy of the Duke 
and Duchess but said that the photographs presented a “lovely couple in love”, which conformed with the focus of the 
magazine on celebrity relationships. As they had been obtained before the injunction, there was nothing withholding 
the title from publishing. The editor of Se och Hör in Denmark commented that the purpose of Se og Hør is to provide 
material to entertain

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK2.9 

Denmark
Any journalist, or individual who imparts news in some way, whether through printed media 
or online, is protected under the Danish Press Council’s professional umbrella. The benefits 
of membership of the Council include access to privileges in law such as the protection of 
journalists’ sources. This has been the incentive for many online publishers to join the Council 
on a voluntary basis.76 They have the ability to differentiate themselves from other online 
media who are not regulated by the Council. Online publishers are expected to contribute to 
the industry funding of the Press Council if they are affiliates of existing members (such as 
the online presence of a broadcaster or a printed newspaper). However, purely online-only 
outlets are not expected to contribute. This is partly due to the non-existence of a funding 
mechanism and is compensated by the Danish Press Council operating the ‘polluter pays’ 
policy, which is applied if an online member breaches the Code.77 

2.10 

It is noteworthy that, in similar fashion to the PCC, the Danish Press Council does not accept 
third party complaints and deals with only those individuals who have been directly affected 
by press misreporting. 

2.11  One of the primary roles of the Danish Press Council is the duty to enforce a right of reply 
(albeit  limited  to  specific  factual  inaccuracy).  This  power  is  enacted  in  statute  under  the 
Danish Media Liability Act 1998, and is procedurally different to the remedy obtainable from 
the court,78 and applies to both newspapers and broadcasters.79 Save for this and for the penal 
consequences visited on the editor-in-chief for failure to publish adjudications by the Press 
Council, there are no other enforceable rights under the Act. Like the Press Councils in Sweden 
and Finland, the Danish Press Council does not have the power to award compensation or to 
impose financial penalties. 

2.12  Although the Danish Press Council is set up in statute, it is still at a fundamental level self-
regulatory and is regarded as such by its members. The eight members of the Council are 
appointed for their industry expertise. Historically, a member of the Danish Supreme Court has 
always been appointed as the Chair of the Council and a lawyer has held the position of Vice-
Chair. The remainder of the Council consists of industry members, who are either journalists 
or editorial management, or independent public members; each is equally represented with 
two positions on the panel.

2.13  Although the system operated in Denmark has its benefits, it has come under parliamentary 
scrutiny,  in  particular  for  the  placement  of  apologies  and  corrections.80  According  to  Ms 
Fielden, publications are:81

“…still,  even  within  this  co-regulatory  framework,  burying  publication  of  an 
adjudication on sort of page 54”. 

In her evidence she highlighted the different approach of publications towards ‘regulation’ 
and noted the distinction between two media camps: those who are found in breach and are

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsKordered to comply with adjudications by the Danish Press Council; and those who voluntarily 
choose to comply with regulation in order to benefit from the protections that membership 
of the Press Council offers. 

2.14 

Sweden
In Sweden, the press and press freedom are specifically protected by two of Sweden’s four 
constitutional laws. These function to protect the freedom of speech (Freedom of the Press 
Act 1991) and the freedom of the Swedish press (Freedom of the Press Act 1949). These 
freedoms apply to any individual who has registered for authorisation to publish and can 
include private individuals such as online bloggers. Both Acts guarantee a ban on censorship, 
the protection for anonymous sources and the right of public access to documents held by 
Swedish authorities.82

2.15  Press standards in Sweden are upheld through the Swedish Press Council. Membership is 
voluntary and not backed by legislation, unlike in Denmark. Newspapers and print publications 
are  authorised  to  publish  as  members  of  either  the  Swedish  Newspaper  Publishers’ 
Association, the Magazine Publishers’ Association, the Swedish Union of Journalists, or the 
National Press Club. There are no restrictions on who can apply for a licence through the 
Swedish Press Council. These organisations collectively finance the system of self-regulation, 
and also set the Code of Ethics for the printed media (and broadcasting) in Sweden.

2.16 

In  Sweden,  the  editor-in-chief  of  a  print  publication  is  legally  responsible  for  all  content 
published  by that title and  is answerable to the Press Council  Board.  There are a total of 
18 members of the Press Council Board. In similar fashion to Denmark, the Chair and three 
Vice-Chairs  are  members  of  the  Swedish  Supreme  Court.  The  remaining  members  are 
representatives from the four associations responsible for funding the Press Council, as well 
as three representatives of the general public who are without affiliation to the press. This 
composition of the Board is seen as a way of underpinning the independence of the system 
of self-regulation in a country that has historically esteemed the freedom of the press and 
sought to protect it in law.83

2.17  Sweden also operates a Press Ombudsman whose role is to investigate complaints, provide 
information and advice to the public and contribute to the development of press standards. 
Both the Press Council and the Ombudsman deal with the online versions of printed newspapers 
and  magazines.  The  Press  Ombudsman  is  the  first  point  of  contact  for  any  complainant 
who has a personal interest in press misreporting or who has been directly affected by it. 
As  such,  third  party  complaints  are  not  accepted  by  the  Swedish  Ombudsman.  The  Press 
Ombudsman does not act as a mediator but rather makes decisions on whether a complaint 
can be accepted and passed to the Council for adjudication. If the Press Ombudsman decides 
a complaint does not warrant formal criticism of the title in question, the complainant can 
appeal directly to the Press Council. There are also no restrictions to prevent a complainant 
from taking the grievance to court after it has been considered by the Press Ombudsman and 
the Press Council. 

2.18  The  Press  Ombudsman  is  appointed  by  a  special  committee  which  consists  of  the  Chief 
Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Chair of the Swedish Bar Association and the Chair of the 
National Press Club. The length of time taken for an adjudication by the Press Council can be 
a further six or seven months after the Ombudsman has considered a submitted complaint

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK(which can last itself three to four months). The remedy for such complaints is the right to 
reply or the publication of a correction. 

2.19 

In contrast to the UK and Denmark, however, the Swedish Press Council operates a system 
whereby titles are expected to contribute towards costs after a breach of the code. Whereas 
only online operators in Denmark are ordered to pay a levy towards the funding of the Council 
if they are in breach of the code, in Sweden, anyone who breaches the code is required to pay 
a ‘penalty’ towards the fund. It is estimated that this form of ‘polluter pays’ policy contributes 
approximately 20% of the Press Council’s funding.84 

Finland

2.20  Finland’s printed press is regulated by The Council for Mass Media (CMM), established by 
publishers  and  journalists  in  1968.  It  is  the  main  body  responsible  for  the  self-regulation 
of Finland’s printed press and broadcasters. It is also the only self-regulatory system in the 
Scandinavian countries that encompasses all media platforms, including online journalism. 
Under Finnish Law, the freedom of speech is protected through the Exercise of Freedom of 
Expression in Mass Media Act 2003.85 Through this Act, publications are obliged to provide a 
public right of reply as well as the duty to correct factual inaccuracies. In similar requirements 
to Sweden, each publication must nominate an editor who holds the responsibility for all the 
published content of that publication.

2.21  The CMM is responsible for issuing Guidelines for Journalists, which establishes professional 
conduct  guidelines  across  cross-media  platforms.  Membership  to  the  CMM  is  voluntary, 
although it is perhaps noteworthy that journalists who have affiliated membership to the 
Council commit themselves to advancing and upholding the principles set out in the Guidelines 
for Journalists. Dr Riitta Ollila, a member of the CMM has argued that the Council:86

“…does not act as a mediator between editors and audience but as a master of the 
code making remarks on the press of their errors.”

Although  the  CMM  has  no  legal  jurisdiction  over  the  regulation  of  the  press,  its  position 
overseeing journalistic standards is generally accepted. The CMM receives state funding from 
the Finnish Government equivalent to 30% of the Council’s budget. 

2.22 

In contrast to Denmark, Sweden and indeed effective practice in the UK, the CMM is open 
to third party complainants. Complaints can be received from any member of public who 
considers that there has been a breach of good practice or violation of the Guidelines for 
Journalists. Any title or broadcaster found in breach of good practice is compelled by the 
CMM to publish a notice issued by the Council within a certain timeframe. Similarly to the 
PCC, the CMM will not rule on an issue or consider a complaint where legal action is being 
taken concurrently. The Council can only rule on complaints brought to the Council’s attention 
within three months of publication. 

2.23  The  CMM  is  comprised  of  eight  representatives  of  the  industry  and  (including  the  Chair) 
four public members. Up until 2007, only a current or serving media professional could be 
appointed to Chair of the CMM. Changes have since been made which now allow a former

improve the operation of the Council, given the rate at which respective Chairs of the CMM 
have resigned.87 

2.24  The membership of Press Councils in Scandinavia has historically been high; it appears that 
this is largely due to the reputational benefits of membership and the accountability that is 
perceived to be afforded by membership of the relevant Council. This is also shown through 
the increasingly high rate of membership by online media outlets, and the online platforms 
of traditional media. In addition, it appears to be the case that, in the Scandinavian countries, 
there is a culture of commitment to (and indeed pride in) high journalistic standards. Therefore 
the question of membership, irrespective of the cost of that membership to an individual 
publication, is not an issue for consideration by media bodies in Scandinavia. As has been 
noted, the only exception is Denmark, where any publication that meets the criteria defined 
by the Media Liability Act, is subjected to compulsory regulation by the Danish Press Council.

2.25 

Germany
It  has  been  argued  by  some  commentators  that  the  German  Press  Council  operates  the 
purest form of press self-regulation in Europe. In Germany, the press are regulated only by 
the press and are only subject to restrictions within the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz). The 
Press Council was established in 1956 and consists of members from industry organisations 
and the press trade unions. The Council has 28 industry members and the Chairmanship of 
the Council rotates between the representatives of the different industry organisations. Press 
behaviour and standards are set out in the German Press Code, first developed by the Press 
Council in 1973, which provides guidelines under which journalists should operate. In 2009, 
the Press Council expanded their remit to include online newspapers. The Press Council relies 
on Government funding for its operations (although there is a stipulation that the funding 
should not exceed 49% of the Press Council’s total revenue).88 Other than providing monetary 
support  to  the  Council,  the  Government  has  no  powers  or  influence  over  the  day-to-day 
operations of the Council. 

2.26  Any member of the general public may make a complaint directly to the Council. Complainants 
do not have to waive their rights to initiate legal proceedings if they submit a complaint to the 
Press Council. If the Press Council Board supports a public complaint, then the newspaper in 
question is expected to publish the Press Council’s ruling. This public reprimand is a voluntary 
undertaking by the title in breach, rather than an order dictated by law or mandated as a 
condition of membership of the Council. Ms Fielden has noted that some 90% of German 
publishers have signed up to the voluntary undertaking, although one major publisher, the 
Bauer Media Group,89 has not renewed its declaration.90 Whilst the Press Council can request 
that these reprimands are published, as with the PCC, it cannot determine the prominence 
given to the publication of the decision.

2.27  The authority of the German Press Council has not gone unchallenged, particularly in response 
to  the  publication  of  public  reprimands.  The  newspaper  Bild,  the  best-selling  German 
tabloid, has questioned decisions made by the Press Council. By way of example, a published 
Press Council ruling on 29 November 2007 was printed by the paper in question not as an

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKadjudication but, rather, as a criticism of that adjudication.91 The problem of compliance is 
ongoing and has led to delays in the publication of apologies. This has led to the reputation 
of the German Press Council being discredited and has damaged the public perception of its 
general credibility as a self-regulating body.

2.28  The  approach  of  the  German  press  is  perhaps  more  aggressive  than  that  in  Scandinavia, 
although it may appear tame in comparison to standards in the UK. Its behaviour has been 
described best as a “balancing act”.92 Significantly, there is a culture in the German press 
(notably absent from the UK press) of titles publicly holding each other to account. In this 
respect, Bildblog is an example of an online media watchdog, which was originally established 
to examine the coverage by the Bild newspaper.93 Bild has also been criticised by its readers, 
notably for its coverage in 2010 of a number of deaths at a music festival in Duisburg.94 The 
title was accused of exaggerating reports of the deaths and came under intense scrutiny from 
the public and industry members alike. The German Press Council received a large number 
of complaints from readers, via traditional methods such as letters to the editor, as well as 
micro-blogging through channels such as Twitter. It has been argued that this event, and the 
resultant response, has led journalists to reflect on their standards of reporting for the future.

France

2.29  The system of press regulation in France is different to the countries so far outlined. In place 
of  a  Press  Council,  the  press  in  France  are  regulated  by  the  existing  body  of  French  law. 
Trade unions and professional associations, such as the Syndicat National des Journalistes 
and the Association des Journalistes Républicains Francais, are responsible for maintaining 
standards of journalism across the printed press. As a consequence, the development of a 
code of standards applicable to the industry has been problematic. Instead, both the Unions 
and  professional  associations  have  encouraged  the  appointment  of  ombudsmen  at  some 
newspaper titles. The first appeared in 1994 at Le Monde, although this has not been popular 
across the majority of the printed press.

2.30  The Direction du Départment des Médias et des Industries Culturelles,95 is responsible for the 
development of Government policy in relation to the media and plurality. It is also responsible 
for providing financial support to parts of the media, most of which is directed towards the 
printed press. 

2.31  Efforts at creating a Press Council in France have been unsuccessful. The most recent attempt 
in 2006 led to the establishment of the Association de prefiguration d’un Conseil de press,96 
led by a group of French journalists, although it is unclear how far their efforts have led.97 It is 
likely that this is a consequence of lack of industry support.

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsK2.32  The corollary to the informal systems of self-regulation in France is the application of civil 
and criminal law. Although the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech are both 
constitutional  principles,  uniquely  in  Europe,  privacy  laws,  in  particular  Article  9  of  the 
Civil  Code,98  are  also  applicable  to  the  press.  Intrusions  into  privacy,  including  the  taking 
of  photographs  of  individuals  in  a  public  place,  are  prohibited.  Article  9  guarantees  the 
protection of the citizen’s private life, from which the right to one’s image emanates. The Civil 
Code, however, is fluid in definition in relation to individuals who have a public profile and, 
in particular, those who hold public office. Under the constitutional guarantees of freedom 
of speech, French law allows for the publication of information on individuals in public office, 
as a consequence of their occupation or status. They are presumed to waive rights over the 
publication of their image, on condition that it is used to inform and not for commercial gain. 
In French civil law, an individual who feels that their image has been misused can request court 
action to prevent the attack (through detention, seizure of property, banning the publication, 
or public denunciation) or seek damages in compensation. In criminal law, invasion of one’s 
privacy is punishable by a prison term of up to 12 months and a fine of up to €45,000.

2.33  Historically,  the  French  press  has  been  reluctant  to  publish  stories  on  the  private  lives  of 
individuals.  Perhaps  the  most  famous  example  of  this  phenomenon  was  the  refusal  of 
the French press to publish stories about the extramarital affairs of the former President, 
François  Mitterrand.  Suffice  to  say  that  nothing  was  printed  about  President  Mitterrand’s 
second  family,  and  it  was  only  shortly  before  his  death  that  the  press  revealed  the  facts. 
There has been a historical willingness to interpret privacy law broadly (and some may argue 
too broadly) and it has been argued that French privacy law is used to suppress information. 
However, increasingly French newspapers and, particularly, celebrity gossip magazines are 
challenging this traditional reluctance to publish content that may be regarded as private and 
such stories are increasingly the norm in France. The recent publication of the photographs 
of the Duchess of Cambridge may be part of this trend.99

Netherlands

2.34  Freedom  of  speech  is  set  out  in  Article  7  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Netherlands.  The 
Constitution also states that the Government has a duty to enable the media to freely exercise 
their profession without any form of undue influence or interference. This is realised through 
the Dutch Media Act 2008. Although the Act regulates only public broadcasters and cable 
operators in the Netherlands, it also ensures that newspapers and internet publications have 
rights to operate independently and free from Government interference.100 101

2.35  The Netherlands has operated a system of self-regulation for the last 50 years. The Netherlands 
Union of Journalists founded the prototype of a Dutch Press Council in 1948; this functioned 
originally  as  a  disciplinary  body,  before  being  reconstituted  as  the  Raad  van  Tucht,  the 

98  http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/content/download/1950/13681/version/3/file/Code_22.pdf
99  The impact of the publication of the photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (obtained by a freelance 
photographer) is described in Part F Chapter 5. The French publication, Closer (owned by the former Italian Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s media company, Mondadori) defends what appears, under French law, to constitute a clear 
breach of the privacy on the grounds of public interest. On 18 September 2012 an injunction was granted restraining 
the title from further disseminating or publishing the photographs; the court imposed a financial penalty of €10,000 
for each day of failure to comply and ordered the publisher to pay €2,000 in legal costs
100  The Media Act regulates the organisation, finance and responsibilities of public broadcasting in the Netherlands. 
The rules set in the Dutch Media Act 2008 are upheld by the Dutch Media Authority, known as the ‘Commissariaat 
voor de Media’, who are responsible for broadcasting but not the printed press.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKNetherlands Press Council (NPC), in 1960.102 This Council describes journalism in the country 
as a completely free profession, where any individual can be considered a journalist and is 
not required to be professionally registered as such.

2.36  The NPC does not accept third party complaints. Complaints are only accepted from those 
who have a direct interest and are affected by the issue and must also be related to a specific 
breach of the Code. It must concern the journalistic practice of either a professional journalist 
or  someone  who,  on  a  regular  basis  and  for  remuneration,  collaborates  on  the  editorial 
content of a mass medium. The Council  can only  pass  judgment and  is  unable  to impose 
sanctions  on  titles  in  breach  of  appropriate  journalistic  practice.  In  the  Netherlands,  and 
much like the UK, a complainant’s route to seeking compensation is through civil litigation. 

2.37  The  fundamental  difference  between  the  system  of  press  self-regulation  operated  in  the 
Netherlands through the NPC and the PCC lies in the prominence accorded to publication 
of  adjudications  against  titles  in  breach  of  the  Netherlands  guidelines  for  journalism.  The 
adjudication summaries published by the NPC name and shame journalists who have breached 
terms on accuracy, or have been found to have crossed the limits of what it is acceptable 
to publish. These adjudications are published in full on the Press Council’s website, as well 
as in the Dutch union of journalists’ newspaper, which is widely read by people working in 
the industry. The decisions are also widely circulated through national news agencies and to 
other media organisations. This very public naming of titles in breach of the code is seen as a 
deterrent for poor journalistic behaviour. 

2.38  Although the NPC cannot force a title to publish a correction, the majority of the media will 
respect such a request from the Council and will comply. Some titles have decided not to 
publish the verdicts of complaints against them, such as De Telegraaf (the largest newspaper 
in the country) and NOVA, a current affairs programme on television, who announced that 
they would no longer cooperate with the NPC. Despite this, 80% of the NPC members have 
indicated that they would publish adjudications involving their titles. 

2.39  The Chair of the Dutch Press Council has historically been appointed from the Dutch Judiciary. 
The Chair is assisted by three Vice-Chairs, who are also drawn from the law. The remaining 
members  of  the  Council  comprise  13  industry  members  (including  journalists)  and  13  lay 
members.103  In  recent  years,  steps  have  been  taken  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the 
Council, including an internal review of systems and functions. Changes have included the 
appointment of five ‘public members’ drawn from the Dutch public at large.104 In order to 
implement  improvements,  the  NPC  has  applied  for  additional  financial  support  from  the 
Dutch Government and has pushed for the adoption of a similar funding mechanism to that 
used in Germany. The review of systems and functions conducted by the NPC also considered 
other self regulatory models, including the PCC. 

2.40  Before concluding this summary of the approach of other European countries, it is worth 
adding  that, in  her evidence, Ms  Fielden  observed  that  Press  Councils  in  Europe  are now 
making  concerted  efforts  to  prove  to  readers  that  they  are  concerned  with  maintaining 
standards. She gave the example of a judgment by the Swedish Press Council, which ordered

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsKthe publication of a decision, which the newspaper title ran on the front page of its publication, 
as a way of setting the bar:105

“…a Swedish paper that had got something very wrong had been censured by the Press 
Council and ordered to publish the Press Council decision, off its own bat published 
it on the front page, and the reason it did that was to say, ‘This is our compact with 
you, the reader. We are different. We aspire to very high standards. When we get it 
wrong, we will tell you that we’ve got it wrong, very visibly so.’”

2.41 

The United States
In some countries there are no systems of press regulation. The prime and only statutory 
structure  of  the  United  States  print  newspaper  industry  is  the  First  Amendment  to  the 
American Constitution, adopted in 1791.106 The First Amendment to the Constitution reads:107

“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting 
the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the 
right  of  the  people  peaceably  to  assemble,  and  to  petition  the  Government  for  a 
redress of grievances.”

The First Amendment protects both the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, 
although there remain certain statutory limitations relating to defamation and privacy,108 as 
well as certain forms of state censorship, which exempt some areas of free speech from the 
protections of the First Amendment.109 

2.42  By way of example, there are restrictions in both Federal and State law in relation to obscene 
images (which may be defined to cover material which would not be considered to offend 
obscenity laws in the UK); there is no equivalent to Page 3. Many US states seek to build on 
the existing Federal law and place restrictions on the possession, dissemination and sale of 
obscene material in public places, in particular those where minors may be present such as 
schools and libraries. 

2.43  The  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  is  responsible  for  the  regulation  of 
broadcasting across the fifty states and on an international scale.110 The remit of the FCC does 
not, however, include the regulation of the print media.

China

2.44  Some witnesses have suggested that any introduction of statute in relation to press standards 
is tantamount to placing the press under state control. It may be of some benefit to turn very 
briefly to look at China and the regulation of print media in that country, if only to provide 
an example of the sort of statutory control of the press that gives rise to these concerns and 
identify the key features of that regulation to demonstrate how widely and dramatically it

Inquiry. 

2.45  Chinese  publications  are  required  under  law  to  abide  by  a  strict  registration  criteria  as 
well as to undergo a process of continual government approval, exercised by the General 
Administration of Press and Publications (GAPP). Individual publications are held accountable 
to the government by official sponsors, defined as a ‘managing institution’, which must be an 
institution recognised by the Chinese Communist Party or the government.111 The managing 
institution is responsible for the exercise of control over the publication and content published 
by it. Specifically, the managing institution should limit any negative coverage of the Chinese 
Government and the Chinese Communist Party. There are, by definition and in fact, no free 
or independent media outlets in China.

2.46  The regulation of the Chinese media by the government is not limited only to the domestic 
market. Indeed, the Chinese Government seeks to control the content of Chinese language 
newspapers published abroad. The Epoch Times is a Chinese newspaper founded in 2000 
operated from the UK; it provides an interesting perspective on the reach of Chinese press 
regulation.112  Their  submission  to  the  Inquiry  suggests  that  the  influence  of  the  Chinese 
Communist  Party  extends  to  the  Chinese  language  print  media  in  the  UK  and  that  this 
influence is exercised through the Chinese Embassy. They have said that the Embassy seeks 
to influence media outlets targeted at the Chinese community and has sought to discourage 
its circulation. The Director of the English edition, Sek Halu, has suggested that a number of 
retailers and supermarkets have refused to stock the Epoch Times because of its critical view 
of the CCP.113

Zealand
The  development  of  new  media  and,  in  particular,  the  convergence  of  delivery  platforms 
for content, has challenged existing models of press regulation, causing some regulators to 
review the extant regulatory frameworks to consider how best to respond to this changing 
environment  and  how  new  forms  of  content  delivery  might  be  incorporated  into  existing 
regulatory structures. 

In Australia, the structures and functions of the existing Australian Press Council have recently 
been considered as part of a wider review of press standards, in the context of the Independent 
Media Inquiry, otherwise known as the Finkelstein Inquiry. The Finkelstein Inquiry has fed 
into  the  wider  Convergence  Review,  being  conducted  by  the  Australian  Government,  of 
regulation across media platforms in Australia and broader media policy. In New Zealand, the 
Law Commission has looked specifically at the privileges and benefits accorded to traditional 
media and have considered how these might be applied to new media.

Women’s Federation

Australian Independent Media Inquiry: the Finkelstein Report
The  Independent  Media  Inquiry  was  established  by  the  Australian  Government  on  14 
September 2011. A former Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, Mr Ray Finkelstein QC, 
was appointed to conduct the Inquiry. The Independent Media Inquiry invited submissions 
from any person with an interest in the issue and held public hearings in Melbourne, Sydney 
and  Perth  during  November  and  December  2011.  In  parallel  to  these  hearings,  the  Chair 
of the Inquiry also invited selected individuals, organisations, trade associations and other 
interested  parties  to  make  formal  submissions.  Responses  were  received  from  a  range  of 
parties,  including  serving  editors  of  Australia’s  major  media  outlets,  former  editors  with 
experience of the news media industry, the current Chair of the Australian Press Council (as 
well as former Chairs), and academics specialising in media and regulation.

The timing of the Independent Media Inquiry has overlapped with the establishment of this 
Inquiry. Although the former was not set up in response to any allegations of wrongdoing at 
News Limited (the Australian subsidiary of News Corp), or to investigate any press misconduct, 
it  was  nevertheless  indirectly  provoked  by  the  allegations  of  phone  hacking  and  corrupt 
payments at News International that led to this Inquiry.114

The Terms of Reference for the Independent Media Inquiry focussed on the efficacy of existing 
codes of conduct governing media practice in Australia, particularly the likely impact on these 
of the growing convergence of print media and digital and online platforms. Mr Finkelstein 
was also required to investigate:115 

“The impact of this technological change on the business model that has supported 
the  investment  by  traditional  media  organisations  in  quality  journalism  and  the 
production of news, and how such activities can be supported, and diversity enhanced, 
in  the  changed  media  environment;  ways  of  substantially  strengthening  the 
independence and effectiveness of the Australian Press Council, including in relation 
to online publications, and with particular reference to the handling of complaints; 
and any related issues pertaining to the ability of the media to operate according to 
regulations and codes of practice, and in the public interest.” 

The  Independent  Media  Inquiry  concluded  its  review  and  reported  to  the  Australian 
Government on 28 February 2012. Mr Finkelstein recommended that the current Australian 
Press Council (APC) should be replaced by an independent body, the News Media Council 
(NMC).116 The role of the NMC would be to ensure that Australian news media operated in a 
more accountable manner to those who were the subject of press reporting, as well as to the 
general public at large. To enable the NMC to exercise this function, Mr Finkelstein argued 
that  the  NMC  should  have  strengthened  remedial  powers  to  deal  with  complaints  about 
the press. These proposed powers would be significantly greater than those available to the 
existing APC. Mr Finkelstein also proposed that the NMC should have powers to enforce a 
right of reply, the withdrawal of an article from further circulation, and the publication of 
apologies and Council adjudications (including the ability to control the size and prominence 
of these publications). These remedial powers are, according to Mr Finkelstein, necessary to 
preserve the integrity of the press.

3.10 

The NMC would also be responsible for setting journalistic standards, in consultation with the 
industry, and to handle complaints across all media platforms (specifically print, online, radio 
and television). Mr Finkelstein proposed a greater level of funding from the Government for 
the body which would replace the current levy system. He argued that this would remove a 
current burden on the print industry but would also address the issue of the independence 
of the NMC from the industry.

Perhaps more significantly, and indeed a change of greater significance, Mr Finkelstein also 
proposed  that  a  legal  requirement  should  be  established  to  grant  powers  to  the  NMC  to 
take legal action against any media outlet that refused to comply with the requirements set 
by the NMC. By way of example, if a publication refused to publish an adjudication issued 
by the NMC, the Council or the complainant would have the right to apply for a court order 
compelling compliance from the publication. Any failure by the publication to comply with 
the court order would be subject to existing legal processes. It is this particular aspect of Mr 
Finkelstein’s proposals that has been the subject of considerable and heated media criticism. 

In  his  concluding  remarks,  Mr  Finkelstein  drew  comparisons  between  his  review  and  this 
Inquiry. He acknowledged that, although the Independent Media Inquiry was not established 
in response to phone hacking in Australia, they shared the historical experience of a Press 
Council that had limited powers as a self-regulatory body and was unable to fully bring the 
press  to  account  in  the  public  eye.  Mr  Finkelstein  has  also  speculated,  in  relation  to  this 
Inquiry, that:117

“Looking at the matter from afar, it would not be surprising if statutory regulation 
were top of the list.”

Public and Industry Response to the Finkelstein Report
It would be an understatement to observe that Mr Finkelstein’s recommendations have not 
gone unchallenged by the Australian press. Rather, the Report has led to a wide-ranging and, 
at times, heated debate as to the nature of press freedom in Australia.118 News Limited’s Chief 
Executive, Kim Williams, called the Independent Media Inquiry’s report “too draconian” and 
argued that there was little value in replacing the existing Australian Press Council (APC) with 
the NMC as proposed by Mr Finkelstein.119 Mr Williams went further and, speaking at the Pacific 
Area Newspaper Publishers’ Association forum in Sydney, suggested that the Independent 
Media Inquiry was established by the minority Australian Labor Party Government primarily 
to attack News Limited, as a direct response to the coverage the Government was receiving 
in his company’s newspapers.120 

3.11  Bob Cronin, group editor-in-chief of West Australian Newspapers, also expressed his opposition 
to Mr Finkelstein’s proposals. He heavily criticised the element of increased oversight of the 
new Council, as well as the powers of a Government-appointed regulator to control what the 
media was able to publish. He argued that the proposals were:121

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsK“…the most outrageous assault on our democracy in the history of the media.” 

3.12  A different perspective was provided by the Chair of the current APC, Professor Julian Disney, 
who has continued to argue for the improvement of resources available to the APC to ensure 
that it was able to fulfil its complaints-handling responsibilities. He stated that:122

“…resources  are hopelessly  inadequate  and  they  were even before  our  number  of 
complaints doubled so it is really just to carry out the responsibilities that we are 
meant to have and that people expect us to do.”

3.13 

In this respect, Professor Disney agreed with many of the central recommendations of Mr 
Finkelstein’s  report  which,  he  suggested,  clearly  identified  the  fundamental  flaws  in  the 
current  system  of  complaints  handling  through  the  APC.  However,  Professor  Disney  has 
strongly disagreed with the two particular elements of Mr Finkelstein’s proposals.123 He also 
drew attention to the absence of any coverage by local newspapers of the APC’s opinions of 
Mr Finkelstein’s report.124 He stated that no Sydney or Melbourne paper had reported the 
views of the APC, despite the body being the main focus of the report, or their response to 
the proposals. He argued that this was a striking example of the lack of balanced coverage 
that existed in the Australian press. 

3.14  Some commentators have chosen not to focus on the detail of the proposals but have instead 
considered how the recommendations might be applied in practice, particularly as that Mr 
Finkelstein concluded the NMC should not be established by statute. Echoing the views of a 
number of Australian commentators, the former financial journalist Jim Parker, who currently 
writes for the respected Australian media blog, The Failed Estate,125 argued that, without a 
statutory backdrop, the powers of the proposed NMC would be without effect.126

Australian Convergence Review

3.15  The  Convergence  Review  was  established  in  early  2011  by  the  Australian  Government  to 
examine the current system of media regulation in the light of the challenges posed by the 
conversion of services and the proliferation of media platforms. Specifically, the Convergence 
Review sought to establish whether a single model could be applied across the media. 

3.16  This review was led by the Convergence Review Committee, chaired by Glen Boreham, former 
Managing  Director  of  IBM  Australia  and  New  Zealand.127  The  Committee  was  also  tasked 
with looking at how the recommendations of Mr Finkelstein’s Independent Media Inquiry 
might be incorporated into media regulation.128 The Committee reported to the Minister for 
Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, on 30 March 
2012. 

3.17  The Convergence Review Committee recommended that any media title, regardless of the 
platform on which their content was delivered, should be subjected to certain restrictions by a

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKsingle regulator.129 In this respect, the Committee proposed that the licensing of broadcasting 
services  should  cease,  and  the  regulation  of  the  media  should  be  undertaken  by  a  single 
statutory  body  which  would  replace  the  existing  Australian  Communications  and  Media 
Authority (ACMA). The new regulator would be responsible for any media enterprise, across 
all platforms, defined as ‘content service enterprises’; this means organisations that:130 

“…have control over the professional content they deliver; have a large number of 
Australian users of that content; and have a high level of revenue derived from supply 
that professional content to Australians.”

3.18 

In this regard, the Convergence Review recommended that thresholds should be defined in 
relation to the annual revenue of a concern, as well as the number of readers (or ‘hits’) any 
media title attracts within the Australian market.131 By setting these thresholds, Australia’s 
15 largest media companies would be subject to regulation by the new body. Ms Fielden 
noted in her evidence to the Inquiry that online operator, Google, would be exempt from this 
definition, despite the company’s reach within the Australian media market. This was due to 
the stipulation that saw Google’s revenue understood in terms of professionally produced 
material, rather than as a content service enterprise.132

3.19  The  Committee’s  proposals  did  not,  however,  take  forward  the  recommendation  of  the 
Independent Media Inquiry to establish the new News Media Council. Rather, it proposed 
an industry-led body for maintaining news standards across all media and communications, 
in the stead of the Government-appointed regulator proposed by Mr Finkelstein. This was in 
addition to the recommendation for a statutory regulator to replace the ACMA.

3.20  At the time of writing, the Australian Government was still considering the recommendations 
of both Committees. However, whatever the eventual Government response, it will no doubt 
alter the regulatory landscape of Australia in relation to the convergence of print, broadcast 
and online media.

Public and Industry Response to the Convergence Review

3.21  There  has  been  a  mixed  response  from  the  industry  to  the  recommendations  of  the 
Convergence Review. Although these recommendations have not generated the same levels 
of controversy and debate as those put forward by Mr Finkelstein, a number of commentators 
saw the proposals as part of a continued, and in some cases deliberate, erosion of the freedom 
of the press.133 In her evidence, Ms Fielden drew the attention of the Inquiry to the response 
of some parts of the Australian press, which have argued that the Convergence Review was 
purposefully established in order to regulate the fifteen companies which would fall under 
the  definition  of  ‘content  service  enterprises’,  and  has  been  otherwise  unconcerned  with 
other areas of media regulation that ought to have been considered more fully by the review. 
Ms Fielden disputed the validity of this assessment of the Convergence Review.134

Chapter 5 | International ComparatorsK3.22  Ms Fielden also told the Inquiry of the recent changes implemented to improve the function 
and  practice  of  the  Australian  Press  Council  (APC),  introduced  in  response  both  to  the 
Convergence Review and the allegations of wrongdoing, in particular the allegations of phone 
hacking that led to the establishment of this Inquiry. She said that the Council had actively 
responded to the calls for reform of press regulation, and had proactively sought to consult 
the Australian public in order to determine how best to hold the press to account. This had led 
the APC consciously to shift its focus of activity to the maintenance and improvement of press 
standards, ensuring the fair balance of the Journalists’ Code and the mediation of complaints. 
The  APC  had  appointed  an  advisory  board  tasked  with  monitoring  the  coverage  by  news 
media of issues which were likely to give rise to a substantial number of complaints.135 

New Zealand Law Commission Review

3.23  The New Zealand Law Commission Review examined the legal and regulatory environment 
in which the media operated in New Zealand and, specifically, the privileges that existed for 
print media and whether these should be extended to their online equivalents. Such privileges 
included legal rights to the protection of sources and others relating to court proceedings. 
The Review tried to set a framework which defined who should benefit from these privileges 
and how. The Terms of Reference were to examine the following questions:136 

“how  to  define  ‘news  media’  for  the  purposes  of  the  law;  whether,  and  to  what 
extent,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Broadcasting  Standards  Authority  and/or  the  Press 
Council should be extended to cover currently unregulated news media and, if so, 
what legislative changes would be required to achieve this end, and; whether the 
existing  criminal  and  civil  remedies  for  wrongs  such  as  defamation,  harassment, 
breach of confidence and privacy are effective in the new media environment and, if 
not, whether alternative remedies may be available.”

3.24  The  New  Zealand  Law  Commission  provided  a  list  of  preliminary  proposals,  published  in 
December  2011,  and  has  since  invited  submissions  in  relation  to  these  proposals.  The 
proposals included the suggestion for a statutory definition of ‘news media’ (to include new 
media), specifically for the purposes of defining which publications should be entitled to the 
rights of the legal privileges and exemptions. The Review also proposed the establishment 
of a new independent regulator, responsible for all news media, regardless of the format or 
delivery platform. In relation to the existing civil remedies for victims of mistreatment by the 
press or other media, the Review proposed the creation of a Communications Tribunal, which 
would handle complaints in the context of the changing publishing environment.

3.25  The Law Commission’s preliminary Report was published to encourage wider public debate, 
as well as to generate feedback on the scale and scope of initial solutions. By way of example, 
the Law Commission produced two options, for consideration by the public and stakeholders, 
as  to  whether  membership  of  the  new  body  should  be  enforced  by  statute  or  remain 
voluntary. The consultation period ran from December 2011 to March 2012.137 The paper and 
accompanying proposals are currently being considered by the New Zealand Government 
which, similarly to the Australian Convergence Review, is due to report in Autumn 2012.138

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKConcluding remarks 

3.26  The alternative models of press regulation, as well as the other recent international reviews, 
have provided helpful examples of the different possible solutions for this Inquiry to consider. 
It is possible, however, to argue that there has been no compelling evidence to demonstrate 
that any of these models, or combinations of them, would function better than any others.

3.27 

It is clear, however, that all the structures considered in this Chapter are embedded in the 
social, cultural and historical functions of the media in each country, and are not necessarily 
ideal structures to apply to the UK. It is also worth noting how many countries are currently 
considering the impact of the evolution of digital platforms, as we have seen in Scandinavia 
and further afield in Australia and New Zealand. This development of online media content, 
as  well  as  methods  of  delivery,  has  brought  the  regulation  of  print  media  into  a  whole 
new context. Although some of the practices revealed by the Inquiry may not be faced by 
other countries, the overarching questions being addressed are not unique; but neither is it 
possible to pretend that any other system, inquiry or review has successfully developed an 
ideal solution to the problems being faced.

teChniques of regulation

1.	
1.1 

Introduction
Part  K,  Chapter  1  sets  out  the  criteria  that  I  consider  need  to  be  met  by  any  ‘new  more 
effective regulatory regime’. Chapters 2-4 look at specific proposals that have been made for 
a new approach to regulation of press standards, and Chapter 5 looks at the way that other 
countries deal with press standards. This Chapter starts from a rather different position and 
looks at the theoretical framework for regulation. This does not purport to be a definitive text 
on the theory of regulation; rather it is a brief look at the different ways in which regulation can 
be achieved and the circumstances that are conducive to different approaches to regulation 
being effective.

2.	 Regulatory	options
2.1 

The Terms of Reference talk about making recommendations for a new and more effective 
policy and regulatory regime and that it precisely what this Report aims to do. There has 
been a lot of talk in the media and elsewhere about the regulation of the press versus self-
regulation of the press as though that were a binary choice. That is not an interpretation 
that I accept. It seems to me that there is a wide spectrum of action that can be undertaken, 
and that, far from a binary option there is a continuum from no regulation at all, through 
to full statutory regulation: a solution can be accessed at any one of a number of points on 
that  range.  This  chapter  considers,  from  a  theoretical  perspective,  the  various  policy  and 
regulatory tools that are available for use and looks at the pros and cons of each, though I 
must reiterate that this is a partial review of the options, not a thorough analysis.

2.2 

2.3 

2.4 

At the opening of the Inquiry a number of briefing sessions were held that dealt with the 
factual background against which the issues under consideration by the Inquiry should be 
seen. At one of those briefings Donald McCrae, an expert in regulatory theory, introduced a 
model for thinking about regulatory propositions.1 Specifically, he categorised the potential 
approaches  to  changing  behaviour  under  four  headings:  engage,  enable,  encourage  and 
exemplify. At the same time the Inquiry heard from a number of regulators about different 
regulatory regimes and about the different regulatory regimes for the press and the media in 
other countries.

This Chapter starts by considering different ways of securing behavioural outcomes, drawing 
on examples where that is helpful. This is a technical consideration of potential models and 
how they might operate.

The Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) sets out general principles of regulation, 
which requires that any regulation and enforcement framework should be capable of being 
implemented  in  a  fashion  which  is  demonstrably  proportionate,  accountable,  consistent, 
transparent, and targeted.2

2.5 

There are various ways of categorising regulatory models. One way of doing so is to look at 
the level of external intervention. This can be cut at almost any level of specificity but we

2  BIS, Principles of Regulation, http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/bre/principles-of-regulation 

1734

Khave identified four levels which we go on to consider in more detail, namely no regulation, 
self-regulation, co-regulation and, finally, statutory regulation.

2.6 

No regulation 
This  concept  needs  some  clarification.  For  most  people  ‘no  regulation’  would  mean  no 
specific regulation or laws relating to the press. However at present the media are bound by 
the law as it applies to the rest of us. This includes many laws that could impact on the sorts 
of behaviour in the press that have been complained of in evidence to the Inquiry, such as 
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), under which the prosecutions for phone 
hacking  have  been  made,  the  Bribery  Act  2010,  the  Fraud  Act  2006,  the  Protection  from 
Harassment  Act  1997  etc.  Critically,  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  provides  rights  both  to  a 
private life and to freedom of expression. There are additional laws relating to press reporting 
on criminal cases. The media are also subject to the Data Protection Act 1998, although there 
is a specific public interest protection under section 32 for processing data with a view to 
publication for journalistic purposes. 

2.7 

So the concept of ‘no regulation’ should not necessarily be considered to mean that journalists 
would be able to operate unfettered by legal constraints. 

2.8 

2.9 

Pros and cons
The principles of better regulation dictate that regulation should be ‘proportionate’ – i.e. no 
more than is required to achieve the policy objective. Clearly if it is possible to deliver the 
desired outcome in the absence of any regulation then no regulation should be introduced. In 
practice this means that ‘no regulation’ is an appropriate response when the market is capable 
of delivering the required outcome without intervention. The very fact that this Inquiry had 
to be established, in the wake of discoveries of serious wrongdoing and criminality, in at least 
one national newspaper, is sufficient demonstration that the market alone will not provide 
public  protection  from  criminal  acts  which  Parliament  and  the  public  have  regarded  with 
abhorrence,  and  which  even  those  responsible  for  committing  them  have  not  sought  to 
justify in this Inquiry. 

Furthermore, the law has to be accessible for if there is limited prospect of detecting criminal 
behaviour or being able to afford civil proceedings, to that extent, there is no sanction (or, in 
the absence of ethical standards) disincentive to comply with the law when to do otherwise 
has potential advantages. Thus, if there is a good prospect of being able, say, to intercept 
mobile  phone  communications  without  being  caught  (because  of  the  care  taken  to  avoid 
alerting the victim and, in the absence of a victim, law enforcement will not be engaged) 
and the advantages to be obtained from listening to intercepted messages are sufficiently 
beneficial,  the  fact  that  others  in  the  market  do  not  engage  in  that  behaviour  will  not 
necessarily prevent it. 

Self regulation 

2.10  There are many different self-regulatory tools. This section considers self regulation in the 
purest sense, where activity is entirely voluntary, where there is no constraint or oversight 
from  outside  of  those  self-regulating  as  to  the  standards  that  are  set  or  monitoring  or 
enforcement of compliance with them. There are a number of tools that could potentially fall 
within the definition of self-regulation. 

1735

Chapter 6 | Techniques of RegulationKInternal governance

2.11  The first is referred to as ‘internal governance’; these are the methods that organisations use 
to establish their own cultures and control behaviour within their own organisations. What 
happens inside a company is a matter of culture, example, practice and control, and these 
internal governance practices and procedures are likely to have the most significant impact 
on the ethical standards applied by their employees and contractors. 

2.12  The Inquiry has been provided with extensive evidence from newspapers about systems that 
they have in place to ensure compliance with ethical standards. Internal governance is likely 
to be very effective in circumstances where it is genuinely in the interest of the organisation 
to secure compliance with the standards. It is less likely to be effective if there are competing 
incentives (for example if the financial benefits of breaching the standards are significant). To 
be effective, internal governance systems must be consistent, must be seen to be enforced 
and must be seen to be exemplified throughout the organisation.

2.13  The  Inquiry  has  also  seen  evidence3  of  many  excellent  systems  of  internal  governance  in 
place in both national and regional newspapers. It is noticeable that the formal governance 
arrangements in the News of the World, prior to its closure, were effectively the same as 
those for other titles in the News International Group, which are themselves similar to the 
best examples of internal governance arrangements that we have seen. I draw two lessons 
from this. First, internal governance can have an important role to play but, second, formal 
internal governance procedures are not in themselves sufficient. It should also be noted that, 
whereas the detail of day to day governance processes are very much a matter for companies 
individually,  governance  is  not  itself  a  purely  self-regulatory  matter  as  some  elements  of 
corporate governance are dictated by company law, or stock market listing requirements. The 
extent to which these rules impact on companies running newspapers is, of course, affected 
by the different ownership structures which they enjoy.

Industry standards

2.14  The  second  purely  self-regulatory  tool  is  industry  standards.  With  a  purely  self-regulatory 
industry standards model there is no compulsion for anyone to be a member, no oversight 
from outside the membership of the standards set or enforcement procedures, and no fallback 
either where relevant bodies are not members or where the self regulatory standards are not 
enforced. This is the model currently in place with the Press Complaints Commission.  

2.15 

It is worth noting that many professional bodies often regarded as ‘self-regulatory’ (such as 
the General Medical Council, the Solicitors’ Regulatory Authority etc) are not self-regulatory 
at all. Their powers spring from legislation that restricts the practice of the profession and 
gives the bodies the right to prevent those who fall sufficiently short of professional standards 
from practising the profession. Similarly, whilst the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), 
which  was  suggested  as  a  model  of  self-regulation4  at  one  of  the  seminars  held  by  the 
Inquiry, is a self regulatory body and architects do not have to belong to it, they do have to 
be registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB) in order to use the term architect 
and the ARB issues a code of professional practice and can take action against those who fail 
to comply. For that reason, these models of professional regulation are not considered here.

2.16  There  are  many  examples  of  industry  groups  who  have  come  together  to  agree  codes  of 
practice that all are willing to adhere to. These codes are likely to require members to follow 

3  Part C, Chapter 2

1736

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKparticular courses of action; in the context of this report this is most relevant where the action 
is aimed at consumer protection. Such bodies may produce a kitemark or similar badge which 
is intended to represent to the public that the members who are able to display the kitemark 
adhere to an appropriately high standard of behaviour in the course of their work, whatever 
that may be. 

2.17 

It is generally accepted that industry self-regulation is often more flexible and less costly for 
both business and consumers than direct government involvement. There are two principal 
reasons for this. Industry experts can be expected better to understand their own processes 
and  capabilities  and  also  have  better  insight  into  consumer  needs  and  responses  to  their 
particular products or services than an outside or external regulator would. Self-regulation 
also allows industry to adapt and react to technological and market change, and consumer 
behaviour, at a speed that formal regulation can rarely match. If effective, this should result 
in better outcomes for both consumers and the industry.

2.18  However, for self-regulation to be effective there needs to be an appropriate alignment of 
incentives to make it so. In practice these incentives tend to be the existence of a market 
need, and the absence of legal rules or regulation to address that need, coupled with a fear 
that the imposition of such rules would have a damaging effect on industry players. Ofcom 
research has found that most self-regulatory schemes have been established, at least in part, 
in response to a perceived threat of state intervention.5 The PCC, established in the wake of 
the Calcutt Report in 1990, as the now notorious ‘last drink in the last chance saloon’ is no 
exception.

2.19  For incentives to align, more is needed than simply the existence of a problem and a threat 

of state intervention. Self-regulation is more likely to be effective in those markets where: 6

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

“companies  recognise  that  their  future  viability  depends  not  only  on  their 
relationship with their current customers and shareholders, but also they operate 
in a environment where they have to act responsibly within the societies in which 
they operate; and; 
companies recognise and acknowledge the identified problems which may cause 
harm or market failure that impede citizens or consumers; and; 
companies,  individually  and  collectively,  acknowledge  the  need  to  reduce  the 
identified  harm  or  market  failure,  since  this  will  improve  the  ability  of  those 
companies to determine the interests of citizens or consumers and, potentially, 
society as a whole.“

A fourth criterion could be added:

(d)  addressing the perceived harm is not in direct conflict with providing the desired 

service to the companies’ consumers.”

2.20 

It is worth exploring this concept a little further. Most self regulatory regimes are aimed at 
dealing with the impact that the relevant organisations have on those who use their services, 
or at least where the consumers of their services would be expected to disapprove of the 
impact concerned. Examples include Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) or other kite 
mark institutions, whose aim is to provide a guarantee of quality to consumers. It is in the 
interests of all members of a kitemark group to ensure that the standards promised by the

6  para 2.24, http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/coregulation/summary/condoc.pdf 

1737

Chapter 6 | Techniques of RegulationKmark are upheld consistently because failure to do so will damage consumer trust in their 
own product. 

2.21  A different example is the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) where Internet Service Providers 
(ISPs) co-operate not only because the majority of their customers do not themselves want 
to be exposed to images of child abuse, but also because it is very much in their interests not 
to be seen to be providing access to such images to those who do want to see them. 

2.22  The potential for successful self regulation is reduced where the harm complained of is to a 
third party and does not obviously damage the interests of the companies concerned or their 
consumers. Obvious examples of this would be the use of child labour, or casual dumping 
of waste leading to environmental damage. Such activities might lead to higher profits and 
cheaper products, so pleasing both producers and consumers. The fact that they have a wider 
social cost that is not generally considered acceptable may be sufficient to prevent this type 
of behaviour but, equally, it may not be if the relevant company believes that it can achieve 
its ends (albeit causing the harm) in secret and without being detected. 

2.23 

It might be argued that public concern over the wider social costs would be enough to lead 
to a successful self regulatory outcome, but the continued sale in the UK of products that are 
made by child labour, or the production of which leads to environmental degradation in its 
country of production, whilst strict laws in the UK prevent such things from happening here, 
is  testament  to  the  difficulty  of  achieving  pure  self-regulatory  outcomes  that  might  be  in 
the wider public interest, when direct consumer interests do not align with the wider public 
interest. 

2.24  A less extreme example might be online copyright infringement. The growth of the internet 
has led to widespread habits of sharing music and film (and increasingly books and magazines) 
online through informal, unlawful, channels rather than buying them from legitimate sites. This 
is breach of copyright and deprives the creators and the creative industries of the legitimate 
revenue that they need to reinvest in the production of new content. The Government looked 
for  self-regulation  among  ISPs  to  find  ways  of  preventing  internet  users  from  engaging  in 
these unlawful activities. However, the harm does not affect ISPs, and providing a solution 
was likely to be unpopular with their consumers who are precisely the people engaging in, 
and (in their eyes) benefiting from, the unlawful behaviour. In the absence of a self regulatory 
solution, Parliament passed legislation requiring action from ISPs because they believed the 
wider public interest required a solution to be put in place even though neither the service 
providers nor their consumers had any incentive to co-operate. 

2.25  The relevance of this final point to the situation with the press is obvious. The Inquiry has 
heard evidence that the PCC is good at some things, such as mediation, and not at all effective 
in  relation  to  others.7  Similarly  we  have  heard  evidence  from  editors8  that  the  continued 
purchase of newspapers by the public is proof that the public is satisfied with the standards 
that obtain. We have also heard substantial evidence of the harm that newspaper behaviour 
has done to many individuals: these include some who have put themselves in the public eye 
deliberately, some who are there incidentally because of a famous friend or relative, some 
who  find  themselves  well  known  because  of  terrible  things  that  happen  to  them  and  yet 
others who become the subject of media interest purely by freakish chance. None of this is 
about harm done to readers, that is to say the people whose purchasing decisions apparently 
tell the editors that they are making the right call; it is all about harm to third parties who 
have no voice in that transaction.

7  Part J, Chapter 4
8  Part F, Chapter 6

1738

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK2.26  The Inquiry has had representations from members of the public complaining more generally 
about the content of newspapers; the complaints include a diverse range of press activities 
such as the sexual objectification of women, the vilification of migrants and the abuse of the 
disabled.9 These cases also raise questions of a wider public interest than purely what any 
given portion of the public might like to read about and therefore whether consumers are 
getting fair treatment. Harm of this sort is less susceptible to effective self-regulation than 
harm as part of the producer/consumer contract.

2.27  Ofcom also argues that self regulation is more likely to be effective where citizens or consumers 
and all other individuals share common views as to the merits of regulating the activities of 
companies to achieve a particular social objective. The vigorous debate that has raged over 
these issues as the Inquiry has gone about its business suggests that this criterion is not met 
in relation to press regulation, in particular as it applies to privacy.

2.28  Finally,  self-regulation  will  be  more  able  to  succeed  in  a  market  environment  with  active 
participation by the industry. In those circumstances, cohesiveness is most likely to administer 
effective self-regulation as industry participants are more likely to commit financial resources, 
consult with stakeholders and monitor the effectiveness of self-regulation. This, at least in 
part, does appear to be the case in relation to the press, with the market having been able 
to sustain the existing funding mechanism for the PCC (through PressBoF) since its creation 
in 1990.

2.29  Self-regulatory  industry  bodies  tend  to  have  few  sanctions  other  than  expulsion  from  the 
body. Levels of monitoring of compliance and enforcement vary. There are various options 
as to how compliance could be monitored. One option is simply rely on members to comply 
with the relevant standards. A second would be to require self declaration of compliance 
and a third would be to have independent verification of compliance and/or enforcement 
mechanisms. The PCC runs a reactive approach, relying for the most part on members to 
police  their  own  compliance,  with  a  reactive,  complaints-based,  enforcement  mechanism 
and an Independent Review which can consider appeals concerned with the PCC process (but 
not on the substance or merits of the complaint or the adjudication). 

User regulation

2.30  A further form of self-regulation is regulation by the user community. Many online services 
are seen to be self-policing. An obvious example is Ebay, in which users rate the service they 
have had from members either as buyers or sellers in order to enable users to buy and sell 
with trust. Similarly the operators of other online sites invite users to self-police by reporting 
breaches of terms and conditions, with the service provider which then takes action when 
notified. This mechanism can work well where it is in the interests of users to provide feedback 
on inappropriate behaviour, and where there are quick and simple mechanisms to do so. It is 
thus a relatively good tool in some online environments but less likely to be effective in the 
physical world.

Co-regulation

2.31  Co-regulation means any form of self-regulation with some sort of external, independent, 
incentives,  oversight  or  form  of  backstop.  There  are  many  different  ways  in  which  the 
backstop can be provided and they will have different impacts. These can include recognition 

9  Part F, Chapter 6, Section 8 

1739

Chapter 6 | Techniques of RegulationKof a self-regulatory body by Government, law or a statutory regulator; approval of codes by 
Government or a statutory regulator; and compulsory membership or funding arrangements. 
Variations on each of these models exist in different sectors in the UK and elsewhere and the 
model is almost infinitely variable. The basic variations are explored.

Recognition of self regulation/regulatory backstop

2.32  The  circumstances  in  which  incentives  might  align  to  make  self  regulation  effective  are 
described above. A further incentive for co-operation with self-regulation can be provided in 
the form of recognition by the courts or a regulator of the process of self-regulation. 

2.33  The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) is an example of co-regulation, where the agency 
act as the regulator in relation to both print and broadcasting advertising. In the case of print 
advertising,  the  Office  of  Fair  Trading  (OFT)  has  statutory  powers  to  deal  with  misleading 
advertising and in the case of broadcast advertising, Ofcom has statutory powers through its 
licensing regime. However, both statutory regulators recognise the role of the ASA and only 
take action in relation to advertising issues when referred to them by the ASA. Specifically, the 
Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988 require the OFT, before considering 
a  complaint  about  the  misleading  nature  of  an  advertisement  to  satisfy  itself  that  ‘such 
established means as the Director may consider appropriate’ have been used and have not 
dealt adequately with the complaint and that he should have regard to the desirability of 
encouraging  the  control,  by  self-regulatory  bodies,  of  advertisements.  The  ASA  does  not, 
therefore, have statutory recognition itself, but the statute sets the framework within which 
the ASA can be given the space by the OFT to operate.

2.34  This sort of approach has many advantages. First, it brings all the advantages of self regulation 
(efficient  regulation,  speed  of  response,  flexibility  in  the  light  of  social  and  technological 
change).  Second,  it  provides  an  incentive  for  industry  to  comply  with  the  standards  and 
rulings of the self-regulatory body since the alternative is to face a regulatory process with the 
regulator. Third, it provides an incentive for industry players to ensure that the self-regulatory 
body is credible, since the regulator can only accept the rulings of the self-regulatory body 
if that body deals satisfactorily with complaints. Finally, it provides a backstop in the case of 
those parts of the industry which might chose not to comply with the standards or rulings of 
the self-regulatory body but who are, none the less, subject to the law and to the jurisdiction 
of the regulator.

2.35  On the other hand, this approach does require the basic ground rules to be set in legislation. 
It requires the existence of a regulator capable of acting as a backstop and it leaves open the 
possibility of conflict between the regulator and any self-regulatory body over what standards 
should apply, within the legislative framework. A basic framework approach of this sort could 
allow for two or more self-regulatory bodies running different codes or standards as long as 
the regulator was content to recognise both, but it would also allow the regulator to favour 
one self-regulatory body over another.

2.36 

In practice, it may be felt that it is easier to arrive at an ASA model where a strong industry 
self-regulatory body already exists, but requires some legislative underpinning in order to 
ensure appropriate standards are set and maintained without exception across the industry, 
than in the case where a new self-regulatory body would have to be called into being. In the 
absence of a credible self-regulatory body, the regulator might have to develop codes and 
standards itself, in order to provide appropriate predictability, consistency and transparency 
in the market. In the online copyright infringement example mentioned above, the legislation 
requires Ofcom to seek to approve an industry code, but provides that in the absence of an 

1740

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKappropriate industry code Ofcom should impose a code of its own that meets the requirements 
of the statute. In that model, a structure which appears, on the face of it, to provide a co-
regulatory approach in practice (depending on the circumstances) can end up delivering a 
statutory regulatory outcome.

2.37 

It is possible to imagine a lighter touch regime than the ASA version. For example, the courts 
could be required or encouraged to consider compliance with the standards of a self regulatory 
body as a sufficient defence against a relevant complaint. For example, if a regulatory body 
established a process for considering the existence of a public interest before engaging in 
activity that might otherwise constitute a breach of privacy then the courts might consider 
that  compliance  with  that  process  demonstrated  (at  least  prima  facie)  sufficient  grounds 
to give rise to reasonable view that the public interest was engaged and the intrusion was 
legitimate. 

2.38  On the one hand, a co-regulatory model can encompass anything that could be done under 
self-regulation  whilst  adding  an  element  of  compulsion  to  make  effective  enforcement 
possible. On the other hand, it can encompass anything that could be done by a statutory 
regulator but put relevant decision making in the hands of those closest to the industry, and 
rigorously separate from Government, to seek to gain the benefits of self-regulation without 
losing the benefits of statutory backing. This is a model that is much in use in the UK. Most 
professional regulation is co-regulation by this definition where the practice of the profession 
(law, medicine, architecture etc) is protected by law and the professional bodies that, police 
it do so with the statutory backing that allows them to rescind or refuse a license to practise. 
Advertising  is  a  well  known  example  of  successful  co-regulation.  Others  include  ATVOD, 
PhonePayPlus and the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures.

2.39 

Statutory regulation
In  this  Report  a  reference  to  statutory  regulation  means  a  system  where  the  scope  and 
coverage of the regulation is set by statute. Again, there is a broad spectrum. At one end 
is  the  situation  where  the  full  detail  of  the  regulation  (in  fact,  law)  is  set  by  statute  with 
enforcement by the police or otherwise through the courts. At the next level, is the regime 
where most of the detail of the regulation is set by statute, but with a regulator acting primarily 
as an enforcement body: many consumer protection regulations, with OFT regulating, fall 
into this category. Then there is the case where the regulator is established by statute and 
given objectives to meet, along with the tools with which to do so, leaving the regulator to set 
the detail of the regulations, to make regulatory decisions and then to enforce them: most 
sectoral regulators such as Ofcom, Ofgem, and Ofwat fall into this category. In some models 
the regulations set by the regulator might themselves need to be approved by Parliament. In 
others the regulator is free to manage the regulatory regime without external oversight but 
subject to appeal though an appropriate judicial body.

2.40  Statutory regulation, with the legitimacy of Parliamentary debate and approval, represents the 
will of the people to impose certain standards of behaviour. Statutory regulation is primarily 
used to address circumstances where horizontal law is insufficiently precise to deliver the 
outcomes required and, where the nature of the problem to be resolved is such that the 
operation of the market is not likely to deliver the solution. This is the case, for example, 
where there is a high degree of concentration within an industry, leading to the possibility of 
anti-competitive behaviour with negative impacts for consumers. It is also unlikely that the 
market alone will provide appropriate consumer protection where companies take a short-

1741

Chapter 6 | Techniques of RegulationKterm  view  of  the  factors  influencing  their  viability  and  are  focused  predominantly  on  the 
interest of their current customers and shareholders. 

2.41  Statutory regulation is an effective way of dealing with issues relating to the impact on third 
parties of activities outside the commercial relationship involved. Legislation can be used to 
require parties to take into account broader social or public interest issues that would not 
otherwise form a part of their commercial consideration of their interest. To express that 
in more economic language, this is where external costs arising from the activities of the 
companies are borne predominantly by sections of the society other than by the customers 
of those companies and the companies themselves.

3.	 Regulatory	tools
3.1 

The previous section considers different ways in which regulation can be delivered. This section 
aims to consider the types of tools that can be used. Most of these tools could form part of 
any regulatory tool kit whether it was self-regulatory, co-regulatory or statutory regulation.

3.2 

The purpose of regulation is to deliver an outcome that society wants. However, regulation is 
not the only way to influence or change behaviour. I thus turn to the categorisation identified 
by Mr McCrae of the different ways in which changes to behaviour can be encouraged and 
influenced, namely: enabling, engaging, exemplifying and encouraging.

3.6 

Enable

This includes removing barriers (of whatever sort) to the desired behaviour, giving information 
and  providing  viable  alternatives,  including  through  capacity  building,  skills,  training  and 
facilities. Two different aspects of press culture have been raised with the Inquiry: on the one 
hand, there is behaviour that breaks the law or is, in some other way, in breach of recognised, 
accepted  standards  (which,  in  shorthand,  I  refer  to  as  unethical),  and  on  the  other  hand, 
there is concern that the press is not sufficiently engaged in genuine investigative work. The 
Inquiry has not heard any evidence to suggest that there are barriers preventing lawful or 
ethical behaviour, as opposed to pressures encouraging unethical behaviour. The Inquiry has, 
however, heard arguments10 that there are barriers in place that make it difficult for the press 
to pursue legitimate investigatory journalism, in particular current libel laws, the new Bribery 
Act and uncertainty over the interpretation of the public interest.  

There  is  no  doubt  that  newspapers  are  largely  operating  in  an  increasingly  challenging 
economic  environment,  with  the  need  to  compete  with  24  hour  news  and  the  internet. 
Newspapers are now required not only to fill their printed pages on a daily (or weekly) basis 
but also to provide constantly updated content on websites and they do this with reduced 
numbers of journalists. In this context, issues around resourcing and training of journalists 
are clearly highly relevant.

Engage

Another  route  to  changing  behaviour  is  to  leverage  the  enthusiasm  and  commitment  of 
interested  parties.  This  involves  community  action,  media,  opinion  formers  and  using 
networks. There is clearly substantial interest from MPs, the public, academics and pressure 
groups in the issues of press culture and ethics.  

The Inquiry has seen no evidence of a lack of engagement on the part of those outside of 
the media. On the other hand the partial approach to reporting in the press either the extent 
(or even the existence) of problems with press ethics has been exemplified by reporting of 
the phone-hacking scandal from the very beginning. It is widely, and rightly, recognised that 
there would not have been the public concentration on these issues of press culture and 
ethics had not an investigative journalist, (Nick Davies), with a support of national newspaper 
(The Guardian), not pursued phone-hacking determinedly. On the other side of the scale, the 
rest of the press, together with the PCC, were keen to paint the Mulcaire case as that of one 
rogue reporter.11 

3.7 

The nature of the problems identified by the Inquiry suggest that the tools of engagement, 
whilst  potentially  complementary,  are  unlikely  to  be  sufficient  by  themselves  to  change 
behaviour.

11  It is also possible to point to the way in which the Inquiry has been reported, in particular relating to the different 
arguments for alternatives to improved self regulation along the lines proposed by PressBoF. The press is, of course, 
entitled to be partisan but the extent to which there has been any balanced discussion or analysis of the arguments is, 
at least, open to debate

1743

Chapter 6 | Techniques of RegulationKExemplify

3.8 

3.9 

Exemplification includes leading by example and achieving consistency in policies. The Inquiry 
has heard many references to examples of excellent journalism and adherence to excellent 
ethical standards within the British press. The Inquiry has, however, heard fewer instances 
of  use  of  such  examples  of  excellence  within  the  industry  to  promote  ethical  behaviour. 
The PCC receives complaints and, unless mediated, produces adjudications on them which 
lead to reminders to papers and journalists of the nature of the code and the production of 
additional guidance on good behaviour. 

The Inquiry has been told of many examples of excellent investigative journalism, ethically 
conducted, being lauded within the industry: examples include Thalidomide, phone hacking 
and MPs expenses. However, on the other hand there appears to be no particular censure 
for unethical behaviour: for example, even after the decision of Eady J awarding damages for 
breach of privacy to Max Mosley, in which the activities of the chief reporter were heavily 
criticised, the News of the World (NoTW) put that story forward for the title of scoop of the 
year.12 The NoTW did not win (the Times won the title that year) but the story suggests that 
NoTW did not expect accuracy or ethical standards to be a material factor in deciding the 
winner. Again, the nature of the problems the Inquiry has heard suggest that, whilst best 
practice will certainly have a role to play, it is unlikely to be sufficient to address all concerns.

Encourage

3.10 

In  the  context  of  this  list  of  mechanisms  to  change  behaviour,  ‘encourage’  includes  all 
regulatory measures, including through the tax system, transparency requirements, penalties 
and enforcement measures and positive approaches such as reward schemes and targeted 
grants.

3.11  Some of these tools are rewards for good behaviour, others sanctions for bad. Some might 
be  seen  to  work  both  ways.  Public  money  can  be  provided  either  to  fully  fund  activity 
seen  as  desirable  (e.g.  the  BBC)  or  in  other  ways.  Examples  from  the  broadcasting  sector 
include Channel 4, which is publicly owned, and has historically been funded both by its own 
commercial income and by subsidies levied from other public service broadcasters and other 
terrestrial  broadcasters  who  have  access  to  spectrum  to  broadcast  and  in  return  have  to 
meet public service broadcasting requirements. 

3.12  There is less tradition of the state funding the press, though many local authorities publish 
newsletters which are distributed to the local population and which contain council news, 
sometimes other local news and advertising. All books and newspapers are exempt from VAT, 
whilst online publications are not. In addition Royal Mail operates a specific tariff (presstream) 
for distribution of newspapers and magazines. 

3.13  Governments can provide public money for grants to encourage all sorts of behaviour, from 
grants  for  film  production  to  the  car  scrappage  payments,  from  the  solar  power  feed-in 
tariff to help with starting up small businesses. Grants and other payments can be used to 
encourage behaviour change by citizens, consumers or businesses of any size.

Afternoon-Hearing-14-December-2011.pdf 

1744

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK3.14  Newspapers and magazines are substantial recipients of public subsidies in some countries. 
In  France,  for  example,  the  press  received  €20m  in  subsidies  in  2008,13  with  all  forms  of 
aid  to  the  press  estimated  at  €1.2bn.14  These  subsidies  take  the  form  of  direct  payments 
for  technological  improvements,  subsidised  travel  for  reporters,  reduced  mailing  rates  for 
newspapers, tax advantages etc. Some subsidies are direct grants, others are repayable loans. 
In addition a new scheme was started in 2010 to provide free newspapers to young people 
(one free copy a week; distribution is also paid for by the Government); this is an attempt to 
persuade the new generation to develop the habit of reading newspapers. 

3.15  Sweden also provides direct subsidies to the press (around €61m in 2009),15 as do Denmark 
(around €44m in 2008)16 and Norway (around €35-40m in 2005)17 both directly and in the 
form of tax exemptions. 

3.16  The tax system is one way of incentivising desired behaviour. In general, in recent decades UK 
Governments have taken the view that the corporate tax system should by used in this way 
only to address horizontal market failures, e.g. in relation to R&D. There are exceptions (the 
tax relief for film is one example) but these are not widespread and there is little appetite to 
increase them. The Inquiry has heard suggestions that the VAT exemption could be used as a 
mechanism to encourage compliance with a self-regulatory approach to standards, but there 
are overwhelming legal problems with that idea.18

3.17  Also under the ‘encourage’ heading is the wide range of more direct regulatory steps that 

could be taken. These are addressed below.

Transparency

3.18  Transparency is valuable in a situation where consumers or others need information to take 
relevant decisions. This could work in two ways. It can take the form of transparency of action 
(e.g. requiring all stories to run under the byline of a real person; requiring transparency on 
the sources of quotes, requiring transparency on the method by which any story has been 
obtained).  It  can  also  take  the  form  of  transparency  of  compliance  (e.g.  requiring  visible 
corrections, publishing accuracy league tables, publishing data on compliance with regulatory 
standards). 

3.19  The advantage of transparency as a tool is that it enhances the effectiveness of the market by 
reducing information asymmetry and putting consumers in the position of being able to take 
a judgment on issues that they might otherwise not be aware of. Transparency should not in 
itself add significantly to regulatory cost, nor does it necessarily require any particular change 
to the standards set, the point is simply to ensure that compliance, or the lack of it, is visible.

3.20  However, the difficulty of relying on self-regulation, where the harm or costs to be avoided 
fall to third parties who are not a part of the commercial transaction to be regulated, was 
identified earlier. Transparency has some advantages in this respect by bringing those external 
costs to the attention of consumers, but it does not actually address the situation where the 
consumers have no direct interest in the external costs or harm.

1745

Chapter 6 | Techniques of RegulationKComplaint Resolution

3.21  Complaint Resolution allows for those, whether consumers or third parties, who consider 
themselves to have been harmed by an action to seek some form of restitution or redress. 
There are various models of complaint resolution. Most start with the complainant putting 
their case to the company concerned. If the company fails to resolve the complaint to the 
satisfaction of the complainant then the matter is classed as a dispute and there could be an 
independent body that would seek to resolve the dispute. 

3.22  Currently the PCC acts as a quasi independent dispute resolution body in respect of complaints 
about  press  conduct  and  content,  but  only  where  the  publisher  is  a  funding  member  of 
PressBoF.  There  is  no  independent  dispute  resolution  mechanism  for  those  publications 
which chose not to be a part of the PCC.

3.23  One widely used model for complaint resolution is the Ombudsman model. Ombudsmen can 
exist under statute or under voluntary agreement, and they will vary in how they operate 
and their powers. The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory body which has powers 
to resolve disputes between financial services companies and their customers in respect of a 
wide variety of products. The role of the ombudsman falls into two parts: first mediation to 
seek an agreed outcome and second, mediation having failed, determination of the dispute 
and imposition of a remedy. In the case of the FS Ombudsman the resolution is binding if the 
consumer accepts it but they can choose to go to court if they wish to.  

3.24  More  generally  Ombudsmen  provide  remedies  which  are  fair  and  reasonable  in  all  the 
circumstances,  and  are  not  necessarily  bound  by  a  strict  interpretation  of  the  law  or 
precedent. In the public sector and in some private schemes their recommendations are not 
binding but met with nearly total compliance. This is secured by a variety of means whether 
by law, by contract, by publicity, by a regulator or by the moral force and the standing of 
the  Ombudsman.  There  is  no  appeal  against  Ombudsman  decisions,  other  than  Judicial 
Review (where applicable) or where schemes (like the Pensions Ombudsman) have an appeal 
procedure in place. 

Incentives

3.25  Many types of incentives are available. The possibility of tax incentives has been considered 
earlier but tax is a very blunt instrument for changing behaviour. Generally rewards can come 
in terms of specific benefits or preferential treatment although it is difficult to consider this 
in the abstract. A number of specific suggestions have been made to the Inquiry in respect of 
the sorts of incentives that could be used, including: coverage in the ABC circulation figures; 
advertisers boycotting publications outside the regulatory regime; enhanced weight being 
given  to  public  interest  arguments  in  relation  to  unlawful  behaviour;  alternative  dispute 
mechanisms to deal cheaply and quickly with libel and defamation cases (as well as other 
standards breaches) without going to court; and access to pre-publication, public interest 
advice that could be relied upon in retrospect. 

3.26  Some  of  these  would  be  purely  self-regulatory  and  would  rely  on  the  goodwill  of  parties 
outside the press (e.g. the advertising industry), some might require legislative change to 
deliver and others might require the involvement of the courts (which means changes to the 
law). All of the incentives that have been proposed to the Inquiry are considered fully in Part 
K, Chapter 4.

1746

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKPenalties 

3.27  Penalties for failure to comply can include dissuasive penalties to attempt to prevent non-
compliant behaviour occurring (or recurring) and remedial penalties to provide redress and 
make good the wrong, once the contravention has occurred. Generically, dissuasive penalties 
can include fines, removal of privileges/rights either as a punishment in its own right or to 
make it impossible for the perpetrator to repeat the offence (e.g. imprisonment, removal of 
a licence), additional checks and constraints on behaviour and public disclosure. Remedial 
penalties  can  include  payment  of  compensation,  and  other  acts  of  restitution  such  as  an 
apology.

3.28 

In the press context the Inquiry has heard suggestions for a range of potential penalties in both 
the dissuasive and remedial categories: these include fines, a regime for requiring journalists 
to hold a press card, temporary prevention of publication, and publication of corrections with 
equal prominence to the offending article.

Introduction
Earlier parts of this Report have set out in considerable detail the systems currently in place 
which seek to address press standards in an attempt to support high quality journalism while 
at the same time protecting the rights and interests of individuals. This has included examining 
the formal systems in place within individual titles, the informal culture and practices within 
titles (and across the press) and the industry agreed standards as embodied in the Editors’ 
Code of Practice which form the standard for the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) when 
giving advice or handling complaints. Throughout, I have drawn conclusions on the adequacy 
and effectiveness of those systems. 

It is important to make the point, yet again, that I recognise that most of the press, most of 
the time, do meet the high standards that the UK public is entitled to expect. I have explored 
good  practice  in  the  Report,1  looking  both  at  the  generic  importance  of  a  free  press  and 
at  examples  of  good  practice  across  the  industry.  However,  when  looking  at  whether  the 
standards regime in place is adequate, it is important that the analysis takes account not 
only of what happens most of the time but also, and critically, what the regime allows to 
happen some of the time. And there can be no doubt that, on occasion, there has been a 
significant failure of standards within and across parts of the national press. To some extent, 
these significant failures have been conceded by everyone: I have concluded, however, that 
they are more widespread than has been universally acknowledged. 

That these failures have included breach of civil rights on a substantial scale is made evident 
by the civil claims that have already been settled by the News of the World (NoTW) in respect 
of  phone  hacking.  The  reports  of  the  Information  Commissioner  in  2006  provided  prima 
facie evidence of criminal breach of data protection legislation on behalf of journalists across 
a number of areas of the national press. And, of course, the police are still investigating a 
substantial number of suspected criminal offences, not just at the NoTW, but elsewhere in 
News International (NI) and in some other titles.2 Arrests have been made covering unlawful 
interception of communications and payments to public officials. Some suspects have been 
charged, in particular in relation to conspiracy to intercept communications without lawful 
authority. I can obviously make no comment on these cases and do not pre judge any of them. 
It is, however, appropriate to observe that the fact that such a significant police investigation 
has resulted in so many arrests and charges so far, at least gives rise to a legitimate cause for 
concern.

1.4 

The  criticisms  that  can  be  levied  against  the  press  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence  that  this 
Inquiry has heard are set out elsewhere in this Report.3 My conclusions on the effectiveness 
of the PCC as an industry self-regulator have been dealt with earlier.4 It is abundantly clear 
from this that current systems of both internal governance in some parts of the press, and 
industry self-regulation of the press, have not worked and are not working.

1.8 

Can the PCC continue to act as regulator?
In Chapter 1 above, I set out the criteria that I consider need to be met for a regulatory regime 
to be considered effective. The system operated by the PCC falls short of these criteria on a 
number of key points. First, it has lost credibility with the public, with politicians and with the 
press itself. This is not just a view that I have reached, but is shared by Lord Black in his own 
submission to this Inquiry5 on what the future regulatory regime should look like. On top of 
that, the departure of Northern and Shell from the system has shown that it is not able to 
deliver complete coverage, even of the major national newspaper groups. 

The PCC lacks the independence that is critical to building public confidence in a regulator. 
It  has  been  dominated  by  the  industry,  both  through  the  influence  of  the  Press  Board  of 
Finance (PressBoF), particularly in relation to appointing the Chair and the press members of 
the Commission, and through the presence of serving editors in both the Code Committee 
and on the Commission itself. 

The Editors’ Code, whilst widely considered both within and outside the industry as being 
a  good  code,  provides  a  set  of  general  requirements.  These  often  contain  a  measure  of 
uncertainty over how and when they might apply. The development of the Code over the 
years  has  achieved  a  great  deal.  It  can,  however,  be  improved  to  provide  a  constructive 
ethical and legal framework within which journalists should work. In any event, compliance 
with, and enforcement of, the Code has been inadequate and intermittent. 

The structures and practices of the PCC have constrained it to acting as a mediator in respect 
of complaints, rather than having any enforcement role that is consistent and effective. The 
failure to identify any code breaches where a mediated settlement could be reached, or to 
provide meaningful statistics in relation to complaints brought and how they were resolved, 
means that there is no authoritative picture of just how often breaches have occurred and 
where  they  have  occurred.  The  manifest  failures  of  the  PCC  to  take  any  steps  to  address 
the  reports  from  the  Information  Commissioner  and  the  discredited  investigations  and 
conclusions by the PCC into phone hacking (since abandoned), demonstrate that the PCC, 
despite calling itself a regulator and referring to self-regulation of the industry, has not acted 
as regulator of standards as opposed to a reactive case-handler. 

1.9 

The remedies available to the PCC have proved an inadequate deterrent to breach. Whilst the 
industry have shouldered the full cost of operation of the PCC, the PCC has not been provided 
with the funding that it would have needed to act as a credible regulator. 

1.10 

It is clear, therefore, that continuation of the status quo is not a credible option, and no one 
has suggested that it is.

2.4 

2.5 

The industry proposal
The inability of the PCC to fulfil the required role has been recognised and accepted by the 
industry, which has put forward its own proposal for the future in the form of a submission 
from  Lord  Black,  as  the  Chairman  of  PressBoF.  That  proposal  is  described6  and  analysed7 
earlier. As I have already said, that proposal does represent a significant improvement on the 
PCC as currently constituted and I recognise, and am grateful for, the efforts that have gone 
into constructing what is intended to be a new, more independent and more effective model. 
However, unfortunately, although it would represent an improvement on the status quo, and 
aspects of the framework could be built on, I conclude that the extent of industry control 
within the proposed system is a fundamental flaw.

First, the proposal does not have the clear support of any larger proportion of the industry 
than the current system. If the PCC is inadequate, at least in part, because a major national 
newspaper  group  sits  outside  it,  then  Lord  Black’s  proposal  must  also  be  inadequate. 
Northern and Shell has not said explicitly that it would not join the organisation if it was to be 
established, but its evidence to the Inquiry is sufficiently negative to give a strong steer that 
that is the case. Certainly, there must be a substantial doubt as to the ability of this proposal 
to command full industry support and cooperation, and there is no sufficient mechanism for 
the critical goal of full participation by all. 

Second, the system as proposed provides no long term stability. This has two features. The 
first is that a five year contract would bind members into the club for that period, but there 
is no guarantee that the system would continue to operate beyond the first five year term. 
The  second  feature  is  that  it  provides  no  assurance  that  the  level  at  which  standards  or 
safeguards would be set would meet the level rightly expected by the public. Or that, once 
set, they would remain at that level. Thus, the proposal does not provide sufficient long term 
stability, durability or guarantee. That is not to say that contracts between the regulator and 
the regulated entity have no role to play in a future model; it is simply the case that they do 
not, on their own, provide sufficient assurance of long term effectiveness.

Third, and of critical significance, the model presented by Lord Black fails to offer genuine 
independence from the industry. The industry, primarily through the Industry Funding Body 
(IFB), would have substantial influence over the appointment of the Chair of the Trust, as well 
as having ‘responsibility’ for the Code and having to approve any changes in the regulations. 
The continuation of the Code Committee with a majority of serving editors, acting in more 
than an advisory role, does not allow for independent setting of standards.

A new system must have an independent and effective enforcement and compliance mechanism. 
As I have already said, I endorse the approach to internal company governance proposed by 
Lord Black. In particular, I support the proposal that complaints should be dealt with in the 
first instance by publishers and the requirements for an annual return on compliance to the 
regulator, and a named senior individual within each title with responsibility for compliance and 
standards. These are real innovations and are welcome. However, the proposal still has serving 
editors on the body making decisions on complaints, and this does not provide the required 
degree of independence of enforcement. The proposal for a standards and compliance arm, 
with both its ongoing monitoring role and its ability to carry out investigations, is welcome, 
although in practice, as currently set out by Lord Black, it could be so drawn out and so hedged 
about with appeals that I doubt it could ever be used effectively.

2.7 

A new system must have the ability to offer meaningful remedies to those who have been 
harmed. This proposal does not offer any significant improvement on the current PCC approach 
in this regard. It must also be able to apply effective sanctions to those who continue to breach 
standards: although real movement has been made in that direction, through the proposals 
on investigations and the power to fine, there are serious concerns about it resulting from 
procedural complexity that is greater and more extensive (thereby causing significant delay) 
than  is  necessary  even  when  having  full  regard  to  the  vital  requirements  of  fairness.  The 
improved transparency is to be welcomed, but it is not sufficient.

Finally,  an  effective  regulatory  system  must  be  adequately  financed  and  have  sufficient 
independence from its funding body to operate independently. It is impossible for me to take 
a view on what constitutes adequate funding given the early stage of development of the 
proposal. What is clear, however, is that the IFB has sole discretion to decide on the funding 
and this cannot give the regulator sufficient independence to carry out its role properly.

Other proposals

2.8  Many proposals, with various degrees of detail, were put forward by interested parties and 
I  would  like  to  express  my  gratitude  to  all  of  them  for  the  efforts  that  they  made.  These 
proposals  are  examined  in  detail  elsewhere.8  It  is  fair  to  say  that,  whilst  there  are  many 
excellent and helpful ideas contained within those proposals (a number of which I am happy 
to adopt), there are none that, on their own, sufficiently meet all the criteria that I set down.

2.9 

If I am not to adopt a proposal that has been put in front of the Inquiry I must instead construct 
one myself. In section 4 below, I look at what a satisfactory system must contain, but first I 
address the question of coverage.

3.	 A	new	system	must	include	everyone
3.1 

A new system must be effective, and one of the key criteria of effectiveness is that it should 
include  all  major  publishers  of  news  (if  not  all  publishers  of  newspapers  and  magazines). 
This has been an almost universal view from the witnesses who have given evidence to the 
Inquiry in relation to future regulation; they have been clear that any new system should 
cover all news publishers, and that compliance with it should not be a matter of choice. There 
has been a striking level of agreement between commentators, the industry and politicians 
as to the desirability of all newspapers being covered by a regulatory regime, although not 
everyone has explained how they would deliver such comprehensive coverage. The Prime 
Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP, said:9

 “What we actually have to deliver is that it is compulsory and has all those things 
that I said [i.e. independence, penalties, compulsion, toughness, public  confidence 
and all the rest of it]”.

3.2 

The Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP, stopped short of explicitly calling for 
compulsion, but was clear that the system should include everybody:10

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK“…it’s hopeless if we end up, as has been the case recently in parts of Canada, for 
instance, where just great swathes of the media have just opted out of the regulatory 
system altogether. You have to have buy-in from everybody.”

3.3 

The Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP set out a number of criteria for a new body, including complete 
coverage of the newspapers:11

“A new body should have: a) clear independence from those it regulates and freedom 
from  political  interference;  b)  proper  investigative  powers;  c)  an  ability  to  enforce 
corrections; d) a system that is focused on the needs of the public which is accessible 
for all and not available only to the rich; e) a system that applies to all newspapers.” 
(emphasis added)

3.4 

The Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions considered the role that should be played by 
regulation and said:12

“It is essential that membership of the reformed media regulator extends to all major 
newspaper publishers. It should no longer be possible for a title unilaterally to opt out 
of regulation with no sanction forthcoming.”

3.5 

3.6 

The Core Participant Victims argued that all newspapers and magazines should fall within 
the  jurisdiction  of  the  regulatory  regime  and  comply  with  the  requirements  of  adverse 
adjudications or investigations.13 

The current PCC Chair, Lord Hunt, said that a new system would not be perceived to be effective, 
and indeed that the credibility of the new system would have been fatally undermined, if a 
‘big fish’ were not a part of it; he recognised that Northern and Shell qualified as a ‘big fish’ 
for these purposes.14, 15

3.7 

A previous PCC Chair, Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry:16

“No system of self-regulation can survive the wilful refusal of a major player to take 
part. There may be a case for back-stop law or regulation making membership of the 
PCC compulsory.”

3.8 

A number of commentators have pointed out that the Lord Chief Justice, in his speech last 
year, argued for a self-regulatory system. He did, as do I, but he also insisted that any new 
self-regulatory system should cover the whole industry:17

 “The new PCC – that is the new body currently in my contemplation in any new system 
of self-regulation – must be all inclusive. You might perhaps be willing to discount a 
news sheet circulated to about 25 people, but any national or regional paper would

is given to it over the entire newspaper industry, not on a self-selecting number of 
newspapers.”

3.9 

From within the industry there has similarly been general agreement that any system should 
be comprehensive in its coverage. Thus, Paul Dacre, Editor-in-Chief of Associated Newspapers, 
and editor of the Daily Mail, in his presentation to a seminar at the very beginning of the 
Inquiry, said:18

“…there’s one area where Parliament can help the press. Some way must be found to 
compel all newspaper owners to fund and participate in self-regulation. God knows 
the industry fought hard enough to prevent it, but the Express group’s decision to 
leave the PCC was a body blow to the commission. How can you have self-regulation 
when a major newspaper group unilaterally withdraws from it?”

Whilst he has subsequently resiled from advocating statutory intervention to achieve the goal 
of comprehensive coverage, his view that all newspapers and magazines should be covered 
by the new regulatory system was repeated in a submission to the Inquiry in July:19

“I also believe absolutely that one of the main responsibilities of the new regulatory 
system should be to ensure that the Editors’ Code is followed both in spirit and the 
letter by all newspapers, magazines and, importantly, their Online versions.”

3.10  This is consistent with the approach taken by Viscount Rothermere, the current owner of the 

Daily Maily & General Trust, who told the Inquiry:20

“I  would  certainly  agree  that  in  order  for  self-regulation  to  work,  I  think  that  you 
would have to have all members of the industry support it, yes. Or the defined industry 
support it, whatever that definition was.”

3.11 

Joint  owner  of  Independent  Print  Limited,  Evgeny  Lebedev,  told  the  Inquiry,  “I  think 
everybody in the industry has to be part of this new future body in order for it to work.”21 
Similarly, Aidan Barclay, Chairman of the Telegraph Media Group said, “I think it does need to 
include everybody.”22 James Murdoch, former Chief Executive of NI, from a slightly different 
perspective, said, “I also think it’s difficult to allow an industry in and of itself to control itself 
on a voluntary basis, given the concerns that we obviously all have.”23

3.12 

It is worth noting two other, albeit contrasting, political opinions. The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke 
QC MP said:24

“I  believe  we  do  need  a  new  regulator-  one  with  substantially  more  power  and 
independence than the PCC, which failed in its previous incarnation, and no longer 
commands the confidence of the public.”

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKHe went on to say that he agreed with Lord Hunt that participation of all the big players is 
highly desirable if the new system is to have meaning and said that a very difficult question 
that goes to the heart of the effectiveness of a new body is how you ensure membership of 
all powerful media voices.25 

3.13  By contrast, the Rt Hon Michael Gove MP was very cautious about any system of regulation, 
expressing the concern that regulation does not always deliver the outcomes desired, but 
might  nonetheless  result  in  a  curtailing  of  freedoms.  He  said  that  he  was  not  necessarily 
advocating a free-for-all, but he was clearly entirely untroubled by the thought of some, or 
all, of the press existing outside of a system of standards regulation.26

3.14  So, with the exception of Mr Gove (although, if present press reports are correct, there are 
others),  the  very  strong  view  expressed  to  the  Inquiry  by  politicians  in  Government  and 
Opposition, from the victims of press abuse, from press regulators and from those at the 
head of the industry itself, was that any new system of regulation should cover all significant 
news publishers, and I entirely agree.

I	therefore	recommend	that	a	new	system	of	regulation	should	not	be	considered	
sufficiently	effective	if	it	does	not	cover	all	significant	news	publishers.	The	challenge,	
then,	is	to	find	a	way	of	achieving	that	result.

3.15  The first task is to look at the suggestions made by all those quoted above as to how they 
would achieve full coverage of a new system. Mr Cameron was reluctant to reach for statute 
to compel regulation of press standards, but did not rule it out:27

“I  think  as  we  go  at  this,  we  have  to  understand  the  real  concern  there  is  about 
statutory regulation. That doesn’t mean you rule it out, but it means try and make 
everything  that  can  be  independent  work  before  you  reach  for  that  lever.  But,  of 
course, if you had to undertake it, the more undertakings, the more safeguards would 
obviously be better. That would be my view.”

3.16  Mr Clegg identified a possible role for legislation in “creating incentives or cajoling all parts 
of the media to be part of a new regulatory environment.”28 He did not define ‘cajoling’, but 
was clear that participation in the regulatory system should not be a matter of choice. He 
also suggested that there could be a role for a statutory backstop co-regulator,29 but did not 
develop the idea in detail. 

3.17  Mr  Miliband  did  not  explain  how  his  vision  for  a  new  form  of  press  regulation  should  be 
delivered,  but  the  Rt  Hon  Harriet  Harman  MP,  on  behalf  of  the  Labour  Party,  proposed 
‘statutory support’ for a new regulatory body both in providing for its independence and to 
give it “the power to enforce its decisions across all newspapers.”30

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK3.18  The Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions recommended that the industry should adopt 
the proposals then being promoted by Lord Hunt (which subsequently formed the basis of 
Lord  Black’s  proposals  to  the  Inquiry)  and  that  a  standing  commission  comprised  of  both 
Houses of Parliament should be established to scrutinise the process of reform.31 However, 
the Committee was clear that this might not be sufficient and concluded: 32

“However,  should  the  industry  fail  to  establish  an  independent  regulator  which 
commands public confidence, the Government should seriously consider establishing 
some form of statutory oversight. This could involve giving Ofcom or another body 
overall statutory responsibility for press regulation, the day-to-day running of which it 
could then devolve to a self-regulatory body, in a similar manner to the arrangements 
for regulating broadcast advertising.”

The Committee also recommended that ‘significant penalties’ should be imposed on news 
publishers who are not members of the reformed media regulator, although the only example 
they offered was that advertisers should refuse to advertise in non-member publications.33 

3.19  The Core Participant Victims considered that:34 

“a  statutory  mechanism  could  be  established  to  ensure  that  [their  recommended 
requirements]  are  met  by  the  new  regime  whilst  guaranteeing  that  the  regulator 
could  not  be  misused  by  politicians  to  interfere  with  media’s  legitimate  right  to 
freedom of expression.” 

3.20  The Lord Chief Justice stopped short of saying from where the ‘new PCC’ should derive its 
authority or how his requirement that it “must be all inclusive” could or should be met. The 
outcome could be delivered by agreement (as I would also wish) but his language clearly 
points to a scheme which permits no exceptions; such an arrangement would have to be 
mandated or required in some way. 

3.21  Lord Hunt was very clear that he did not regard it as appropriate to use legislation to secure 
full participation in a regulatory regime. However, he did not offer any means of doing so, 
other than a general reference to the incentives suggested as part of Lord Black’s proposal. 
Sir Christopher accepted that there might be a case for backstop law or regulation making 
membership of the PCC compulsory.35

3.22  As mentioned above, Mr Dacre has pulled back from advocating statutory intervention to 
achieve the goal of comprehensive coverage, but he has not offered any alternative mechanism 
for achieving it other than the incentives already referred to in Lord Black’s proposal. Viscount 
Rothermere did not address the question of how one would obtain the support of all members 
of the industry, or what should be done in the absence of such support.

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK3.23  Mr Lebedev said that self-regulation was preferable to statutory regulation, but that he was:36

“not averse to statutory backstop, because I think there needs to be a way of making 
sure that everyone in the industry is part of this regulation, regulatory body, signed 
up to it, and that includes online as well.” 

3.24  Mr Barclay urged caution in relation to statutory provision but said:37

“I  certainly  support  the  notion  that  everybody  should  be  included  and  should  be 
somehow obliged to be included.” 

But he went on to say “I don’t understand how we solve the problem.”38 

3.25 

James  Murdoch  said  that  providing  a  solution  was  “above  his  pay-grade”,  but  suggested 
that:39

“it  may  be  a  question  of  a  stronger  enshrining  of  speech  rights  on  the  one  hand, 
coupled with a stronger set of consequences and either a self-regulating body or a 
statutory body that includes the press but also individuals that are not part of the 
working press today.”

3.26  Mr Clarke did not offer a particular prescription but said:40

“I  am  not  convinced,  though,  that  a  statutory  underpinning  of  some  kind  would 
amount to state control of the press. You have pointed out the statutory duty of the 
Lord  Chancellor  to  uphold  the  independence  of  the  judiciary.  I  would  note  as  well 
that press organisations have a legal obligation to register with Companies House 
and HM Revenue and Customs as businesses; this doesn’t appear to me to amount 
to political interference in their work. This is not my endorsement necessarily for a 
statutory  backing,  but  simply  an  observation  that  it  would  not  be  the  freedom  of 
expression Armageddon some commentators would have you believe. I am attracted 
to the idea of contracts, with the possibility (hopefully never used) of civil litigation if 
the contracts are broken.”

3.27  So,  in  summary,  whilst  there  is  limited  enthusiasm  for  statutory  provision  to  ensure 
comprehensive coverage of a regulatory regime, there is widespread recognition that statute 
may be the only way of delivering this goal. Those who shy away from statute have found 
nothing of substance to offer as an alternative means of ensuring that their own objective of 
all industry buy-in can be achieved. A number of incentives to membership of a regulatory 
system have been put forward. These have been analysed elsewhere41 and I have concluded 
that only a few of them are capable of having some effect, and those are included in my 
recommendations  below.  I  hope,  and  believe,  that  these  incentives  will  send  a  powerful 
message to publishers that it is in their own interests to be a part of a system such as the one 
that I am recommending, but it cannot be guaranteed that they will all agree.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK3.28 

I am firmly of the view that the goal here is voluntary independent self-regulation, and I set 
out below my own prescription for what that must look like in order for it to deliver what the 
public wants, and is entitled to want, in respect of independence and respect for individual 
rights and interests. I believe that the model that I set out has real and significant benefits for 
the public and for the press. 

3.29  However, I must also recognise the risk that some publishers would choose to stay outside 
such a system, or even that the industry might not be able to secure agreement to establish 
such  a  system.  Much  as  I  hope  this  is  not  the  case,  as  described  earlier,42  the  history  of 
concerns about press behaviour, and the press and Government response to those concerns, 
has  demonstrated  that  the  industry  has  only  ever  offered  what  could  be  described  as 
small incremental improvements to its system of self-regulation, even though its model (as 
modified) has been shown, time after time, not to be sufficient to address public concerns. 
Indeed, it is highly relevant that the most significant argument advanced for allowing self-
regulation a further ‘last chance’ is that, in truth, the PCC never was a regulator (even though 
that is precisely what it was intended and purported to be). Whatever might now be said, it 
was intended to be sufficiently robust to address the problems identified by Sir David Calcutt QC. 

3.30  There is evidence, therefore, that, left to itself, the press response to public concern this time 
would, in reality, be little different: although there are some new ideas, a full analysis of Lord 
Black’s proposal may, indeed, support that conclusion. As I have said, I very much hope that 
this time the industry and the Government will rise to the challenge and create a genuinely 
effective system of independent self-regulation, but I would be failing in my duty to the public 
if I did not address the consequences if that were not to happen. 

3.31 

 It is likely that, were the industry to fail to deliver what is needed, the Government would face 
entirely appropriate pressure from the public, who would be entitled to demand that some 
action be taken to ensure that the press is accountable and that there was an acceptable 
answer to the question “Who guards the guardians?” Indeed, it is clear that there have been 
two opinion polls published recently that suggest quite a strong public demand for effective 
action in this area.43 

3.32  There are a number of options which I set out in the next Chapter. I readily accept that there 
may be many different views on which would be the most appropriate, and I do not intend 
to make a firm recommendation on this matter as an answer is not needed unless or until 
the  industry  fail  to  deliver  effective  independent  self-regulation.  Furthermore,  if  I  make  a 
recommendation  in  this  area,  press  attention  will  move  from  the  detailed  proposal  that  I 
make to the industry and focus on this recommendation alone. 

3.33  Having said that, it would equally be wrong if I did not make it clear that, if some or all of the 
industry are not willing to participate in effective independent regulation, my own concluded 
view is to reject the notion that they should escape regulation altogether. I cannot, and will 
not, recommend another last chance saloon for the press.

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK3.34  With some measure of regret, therefore, I am driven to conclude that the Government should 
be ready to consider the need for a statutory backstop regulator being established, to ensure, 
at the least, that the press are subject to regulation that would require the fullest compliance 
with the criminal and civil law, if not also to ensure consequences equivalent to those that 
would flow from an independent self-regulatory system.44 

3.35 

I repeat, again, that I do not, at the moment, recommend any statutory backstop and to assert 
that I do will be to distort this Report and the clear recommendations that I do make. I hope 
that the industry will be able to see the value of what I have proposed and come together 
to participate in it. If they do, nothing further would be necessary. Further, I do not suggest 
that a backstop regulator should be the starting point for any discussion of the way forward 
and, in particular, for the legislation that I do propose. But, having said that, I have equally no 
doubt that there needs to be clarity and that it should not be possible for the industry (and, 
in particular, those who have a powerful voice in the industry), either in whole or in part, to 
choose not to engage with independent regulation. 

4.	 Voluntary	independent	self-regulation
4.1 

I now turn to what is required in order to build a genuinely effective independent self-regulatory 
system.  Lord  Black  talked  of  his  model  as  ‘independently-led  self  regulation’.45  Professor 
Baroness O’Neill, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge, commented that:46

“I’ve  noticed  a  lot  of  misuse  of  the  phrase  “independent  regulation”  for  what  is 
actually self-interested regulation. So what we need first to do is to get away from 
that…”

This identifies the problem rather well. What is required is independent self-regulation. By 
far the best solution to press standards would be a body, established	and	organised	by	the	
industry, which would provide genuinely independent and effective regulation of its members 
and would be durable. If such a body were to be established, and were to command the 
support of all key players in the market, there would be no need for further intervention, 
although I believe that there would remain a need for some further support in relation to 
ensuring that independence and providing incentives for membership. 

44 I have been particularly interested in the informal advice of the relevant expert Assessors in framing and drafting 
the detail of the recommendations set out in this Chapter.  All the relevant Assessors have clearly advised that the 
system I am recommending, organised by the industry to objective standards, delivers the independent regulation 
which is essential; it safeguards press freedoms, will not chill investigative journalism that is in the public interest, and 
can command public confidence.  It is their unanimous advice that it is in the interests of both the industry and the 
Government to accept and implement the recommendations to that end.  For completeness, I have recorded one point 
of detail, relating to how an industry body is recognised, on which Shami Chakrabarti gave me different advice: see 
para 6.23 and footnote 56. As for the matters addressed in the next Chapter, two of the Assessors  (Elinor Goodman 
and George Jones) advised that it was not necessary for me to make a recommendation about what to do in the event 
of the press not accepting the preferred option as they believe that independent self-regulation is the best solution 
and that, if the industry considers it carefully, it too will agree. I also record that Shami Chakrabarti advised against the 
contemplation of any element of compulsory backstop standards regulation of the press in the event of the inability or 
unwillingness of the press to implement the recommendations in this Chapter;  she would prefer in that event to see 
a strengthening of the financial assistance available to those who feel their rights have been abused by the press in 
order to help them defend those rights in court.

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK4.2 

4.3 

It  is  important  to  be  clear  about  what  I  mean  by  ‘genuinely  independent  and  effective 
regulation’. My criteria for an effective regulatory regime set the broad framework. What 
I will do now is set out at a level of detail the minimum criteria that I believe it would be 
necessary to have in place in order to deliver against that broad framework.

In summary, I envisage that the industry should come together to create, and adequately 
fund, an independent regulatory body, headed by an independent Board, that would: set 
standards, both by way of a code and covering governance and compliance; hear individual 
complaints against its members about breach of its standards and order appropriate redress; 
take an active role in promoting high standards, including having the power to investigate 
serious  or  systemic  breaches  and  impose  appropriate  sanctions;  and  provide  a  fair,  quick 
and  inexpensive  arbitration  service  to  deal  with  any  civil  complaints  about  its  members’ 
publications. Figure K7.1 below provides an illustrative structure, but this is not intended to 
be prescriptive in terms of organisation.

Figure K7.1: illustrative functions 
of an independent body

4.4 

It is important both to note and to underline that these functions are not dissimilar to the 
basic structural framework proposed by Lord Black on behalf of the industry.

Independent governance
Independence of the regulatory body is absolutely critical.

4.5 

I	recommend	 that	an	independent	self-regulatory	 body	should	be	governed	by	an	
independent	Board.	In	order	to	ensure	the	independence	of	the	body	it	is	essential	
to	 ensure	 that	 the	 Chair	 and	 members	 of	 the	 Board	 are	 appointed	 in	 a	 genuinely	
open,	 transparent	 and	 independent	 way,	 without	 any	 influence	 from	 industry	 or	
Government.	

4.6 

Further, in order to ensure the independence of the body, the Chair of the Board should be 
clearly and demonstrably independent of the press. By that I mean that he or she should 
have no current, or recent, affiliation with any particular press organisation. He or she should 
certainly be committed to freedom of expression and freedom of speech, but that must be 
matched  by  a  commitment  to  uphold  the  rights  of  others  and  to  the  need  to  provide  an 
appropriate balance in a democratic society in precisely the way that Articles 8 and 10 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) identify that balance. The Chair of the Board 
should also be independent of any political party.

1759

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK4.7 

The independence of the appointment process is important and by no means trivial. There 
are a number of specific criteria which I believe should be met in relation to the Chair of the 
Board.

I	recommend	that,	first,	the	appointment	should	be	made	by	an	appointment	panel.	
The	selection	of	that	panel	must	itself	be	conducted	in	an	appropriately	independent	
way	and	must,	itself,	be	independent	of	the	industry	and	of	Government.

Without being prescriptive, it could include distinguished public servants with experience of 
senior independent appointments such as the Commissioner for Public Appointments and 
the Chair of the Judicial Appointments Commission.

4.8 

The body (and the Chair that leads it) will have the task of setting and enforcing standards 
in the press, specifically balancing the interests of freedom of speech and the interests of 
individuals; there are not many more important balances to be struck. In order to ensure that 
the full complexity of the task is taken into account by the appointment panel, it is essential 
that the appointment panel should be capable of balancing the public interest in freedom of 
speech and the protection of privacy and should be free of political influence.

I	recommend	that	the	appointment	panel:

(a)	
(b)	

(c)	

(d)	

should	be	appointed	in	an	independent,	fair	and	open	way;
should	 contain	 a	 substantial	 majority	 of	 members	 who	 are	 demonstrably	
independent	of	the	press;
should	include	at	least	one	person	with	a	current	understanding	and	experience	
of	the	press;
should	include	no	more	than	one	current	editor	of	a	publication	that	could	be	a	
member	of	the	body.

4.9 

I do not intend to say more about the appointing panel. It is critically important that the 
industry, in a fair and open way, get together to identify independently minded people in 
whom the public can have confidence to make up the appointing panel. It will then be the 
task of that body to find and appoint a Chair who demonstrably meets the criteria of fair 
minded and balanced independence to which I have referred. In doing so, the industry will be 
committing itself to organising independent regulation.

4.10  Of equal importance is the fact that the Board itself must be independent of the press, but 
sufficiently  expert  to  ensure  that  regulatory  decisions  are  appropriate,  proportionate  and 
practical.

I	 recommend	 that	 the	 appointment	 of	 the	 Board	 should	 also	 be	 an	 independent	
process,	 and	 the	 composition	 of	 the	 Board	 should	 include	 people	 with	 relevant	
expertise.	The	requirement	for	independence	means	that	there	should	be	no	serving	
editors	on	the	Board.

As with the appointment panel, it is essential that the Board should be capable of balancing 
the public interest in freedom of speech and the protection of privacy and should be free of 
political influence.

1760

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKI	 recommend	 that	 the	 members	 of	 the	 Board	 should	 be	 appointed	 by	 the	 same	
appointment	panel	that	appoints	the	Chair,	together	with	the	Chair	(once	appointed),	
and	should:

(a)	 be	appointed	by	a	fair	and	open	process;
(b)	
(c)	

comprise	a	majority	of	people	who	are	independent	of	the	press;
include	a	sufficient	number	of	people	with	experience	of	the	industry	who	may	
include	former	editors	and	senior	or	academic	journalists;

(d)	 not	include	any	serving	editor;	and
(e)	 not	include	any	serving	member	of	the	House	of	Commons	or	any	member	of	

the	Government.

4.11 

Membership
Ideally the body would attract membership from all news and periodical publishers, including 
news publishers online. It is important for the credibility of the system, as well as for the 
promotion of high standards of journalism and the protection of individual rights, that the 
body should have the widest possible membership among news providers. Clearly this will 
be unlikely to include broadcasters who are already covered by the Broadcasting Code. It has 
been accepted that, although I am very anxious that it remain voluntary, it must involve all the 
major players in the industry, that is to say, all national newspaper publishers and their online 
activities, and as many regional and local newspaper publishers, and magazine publishers, as 
possible. This is not meant to be prescriptive at the very small end of the market: I would not 
necessarily expect very small publishers to join the body, though it should be open to them to 
do so on appropriate terms. Having said that, however, I have no doubt that there would be 
advantages in doing so. Ideally it would also include those who provide news and comment 
online to UK audiences.47 

4.12 

I recognise that most blogs have very different processes, audiences and business models 
to  most  newspapers,  and  that  consequently  it  may  be  difficult  to  establish  one  set  of 
requirements, for example in respect of internal governance, annual reporting or membership 
fees, that is appropriate for all different types of publisher. It is important, however, that all 
types of publishers should be able to join such a body, and to do so on terms that are not 
manifestly inappropriate for their business model. 

4.13 

I	therefore	recommend	that	membership	of	the	body	should	be	open	to	all	publishers	
on	 fair,	 reasonable	 and	 non	 discriminatory	 terms,	 including	 making	 membership	
potentially	available	on	different	terms	for	different	types	of	publisher.

Funding

4.14  The industry, through Lord Black, has made a principled point that the industry should fund 
self-regulation  without  requiring  input  from  the  public  purse.  Certainly,  I  agree  that  any 
industry established independent regulatory body must be funded by its members. There 
are, however, some important points to be made about funding. The body will only be able 
to do what it is funded to do. If it is to be genuinely independent in operational and strategic 
terms, it must have both some certainty and some influence over the level of its funding 
across a reasonable period. Practice in the industry has been for an industry body (PressBoF) 
to set, and levy, the membership fees for self-regulation. In my opinion there is no need for 

47 This is equally apparent from an analysis of the evidence quoted at 3.1-3.13 above

1761

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKsuch a body to exist at all: it would be perfectly possible for the regulator to set its own fees 
and collect them directly from its members, taking account of the financial position of the 
industry. Equally, however, there is not necessarily any problem of principle with an industry 
body acting as a coordinator. 

4.15  However the fees are set and collected, the Board should establish the budget that it requires 
in order to carry out its functions effectively, and fees should be levied accordingly. As I have 
identified earlier, two issues arise in relation to independence of funding. One is the absolute 
level of funding, and the other is security of funding over a reasonable planning period. Both 
are important if the regulator is not to be at risk of being effectively held to ransom by its 
funding members.

4.16 

I recognise that it is not appropriate that the regulator should have a blank cheque, anymore 
than that the industry should have a strangle-hold on the regulator’s budget. In practice, if 
the regulator is too expensive, publishers will not join.

I	recommend	that	funding	for	the	system	should	be	settled	in	agreement	between	the	
industry	and	the	Board,	taking	into	account	the	cost	of	fulfilling	the	obligations	of	the	
regulator	and	the	commercial	pressures	on	the	industry	(which	are	not	as	great	for	
a	number	of	the	larger	publishers	as	they	are	for	the	smaller,	regional	press).	There	
should	be	an	indicative	budget	that	the	Board	certifies	is	adequate	for	the	purpose.	
Funding	settlements	should	cover	a	four	or	five	year	period	and	should	be	negotiated	
well	in	advance.	

4.17 

I  recognise  that  the  start-up  costs  of  such  a  body  may  be  significant  and  those  putting 
together such a proposal may need to look for sources of funding to help to cover some of 
those costs. In this context I do not believe it to be unreasonable for some public funding to 
be made available to facilitate the establishment of a satisfactory, genuinely independent, 
press regulatory body.

Standards code

4.18  The new regulatory regime must have a standards code. The current Editors’ Code has been 
widely praised by those in the industry. It has been developed by the industry over the last 
two decades and has adapted to take account of new concerns and issues that have arisen. I 
have made no attempt during the course of this Inquiry to conduct a full scale evaluation of 
the Code of Practice. My role is to make recommendations for an effective and independent 
structure for setting and enforcing standards, not to set those standards. That is properly 
a role for the independent regulatory body, in consultation with the industry and with the 
wider public. Where comments on, or criticisms of, the Code have been made in evidence 
I have reflected them in this report, but that should not be read as an analysis of the Code. 

4.19  However, there are a few general points I would like to make about the contents of the Code. 
First, if the Code is to provide an ethical framework for editors and journalists to work within, 
then it is important that it should set the ethical and legal context within which it applies, and 
seek to provide some positive depiction of ethical journalism. Second, it is important that the 
Code should be clear and practical. Clauses that are either impossible to comply with (as the 
Inquiry has been told is the case with clause 1(iii) relating to the separation of opinion and 
fact) or that are not entirely clear as to their intention and effect, will serve only to bring the 
Code itself into disrepute and disuse. 

1762

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK4.20  Both of these points (along with some of the academic comment that was offered to the 
Inquiry) suggest that the current Code would benefit from a thorough review, with the aim 
of developing a clearer statement of the standards expected of editors and journalists. Thus, 
if, for example, the present formulation relating to the separation of opinion and fact does 
not work, a reconsideration of the wrong being targeted might lead to that concern being 
addressed in a different way. In structural terms, whilst it is of course essential that editors 
should  take  pride  in  their  Code,  and  that  it  should  be  thoroughly  grounded  in  real  world 
current experience of the industry, it cannot be right that the standards to which the industry 
are to be held are set without independent oversight. 

4.21 

In order for the new regulatory regime to have the independence required to secure public 
trust  and  confidence,  it  is  essential  that  it  should  be  the  regulator  who  approves  a  code 
of standards to which members must adhere. The Board could well be advised by a Code 
Committee including serving editors and journalists, but with independent members as well: 
indeed, I can see no reason why the Code Committee in the amended form as proposed by 
Lord Black should not be constituted as a formal advisory body to the Board.

I	recommend	that	the	standards	code	must	ultimately	be	the	responsibility	of,	and	
adopted	 by,	 the	 Board	 advised	 by	 a	 Code	 Committee	 which	 may	 comprise	 both	
independent	members	of	the	Board	and	serving	editors.	

4.22  As a further step to secure public confidence, it appears to me that it would be valuable if the 
Board was to satisfy itself that the proposed Code had been subjected to public consultation, 
albeit on the basis that the Code Committee would then analyse the result of any consultation 
and provide the Board with the benefit of its experience on issues that might have arisen. 
Thus the Code would command the confidence of both the public and the industry.

4.23  As I have said above, I have no particular desire to comment on the actual content of the 
Code. It is both important and appropriate, however, that I make some recommendations 
about the scope and coverage of the Code. The Code will be the document that articulates 
the nature of the boundaries between journalism, its subjects and its readers. As such it is 
essential that it fully reflects the interests of all three.

I	 therefore	 recommend	 that	 the	 Code	 must	 take	 into	 account	 the	 importance	 of	
freedom	of	speech,	the	interests	of	the	public	(including	the	public	interest	in	detecting	
or	 exposing	 crime	 or	 serious	 impropriety,	 protecting	 public	 health	 and	 safety	 and	
preventing	 the	 public	 from	 being	 seriously	 misled)	 and	 the	 rights	 of	 individuals.	
Specifically,	it	must	cover	standards	providing	for:

(a)	

conduct,	especially	in	relation	to	the	treatment	of	other	people	in	the	process	
of	obtaining	material;	

(b)	 appropriate	 respect	 for	 privacy	 where	 there	 is	 no	 sufficient	 public	 interest	

justification	for	breach;	and
accuracy,	and	the	need	to	avoid	misrepresentation.

(c)	

4.24  The  Code  must  set  out  a  clear  picture  of  how  good  journalism  serves  the  public  interest 
and the implications that has for journalistic behaviour. The Inquiry has heard that different 
editors have different views on what constitutes the public interest, and that may well be the 
case. The Code will have to take a sufficiently broad approach to encompass the different 
views  and  different  perspectives  of  different  types  of  journalism.  However,  the  regulator, 
when applying the Code, will have to adopt a consistent interpretation of the public interest. 

1763

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKIf an editor can create his own definition of the public interest without any constraint then 
the standards will be meaningless. The regulator, alongside the Code, must provide guidance 
on the interpretation of the public interest that justifies what otherwise would constitute 
a breach of the Code and must do so in the context of the different provisions of the Code 
so that the greater the public interest, the easier it will be to justify what might otherwise 
be considered as contrary to standards of propriety. That guidance should be available for 
editors and journalists to use when making day-to-day decisions, and should also be the basis 
of decisions taken on complaints about breach of the Code. 

Organisational requirements

4.25  The concerns about press standards that the Inquiry has heard about give rise to equivalent 
concerns about governance, across some parts of the press, in relation to internal procedures 
for dealing with complaints and ensuring legal and standards compliance. An effective new 
regulatory regime should address these internal governance issues. It is important that the 
companies should take responsibility for their own compliance with the standards that they 
sign up to. I do not expect the regulator necessarily to define the governance processes that 
member companies should adopt, though it may choose to set principles. However:

I	do	recommend	that	the	Board	should	require	of	those	who	subscribe,	appropriate	
internal	 governance	 processes,	 transparency	 on	 what	 governance	 processes	 they	
have	in	place,	and	notice,	of	any	failures	in	compliance,	together	with	details	of	steps	
taken	to	deal	with	failures	in	compliance.

4.26  Publishers should have adequate (and timely) processes in place for dealing with complaints 
from  readers  and  members  of  the  public  about  breach  of  standards.  It  is  absurd  that 
complainants should be encouraged to take their complaints to a regulatory body instead of 
the company concerned seeking, in the first instance, to deal with the complaint themselves. 
Taking a complaint to the regulator should be the last step, not the first.

I	 recommend	 that	 the	 Board	 should	 require	 all	 those	 who	 subscribe	 to	 have	 an	
adequate	and	speedy	complaint	handling	mechanism;	it	should	encourage	those	who	
wish	to	complain	to	do	so	through	that	mechanism	and	should	not	receive	complaints	
directly	unless	or	until	the	internal	complaints	system	has	been	engaged	without	the	
complaint	being	resolved	in	an	appropriate	time.

4.27 

4.28 

It is already generally accepted that the editor of a newspaper is ultimately responsible for all 
that happens within it. That must be true, and it must be accepted and acted on at a practical 
level. Editors must, as a matter of course, accept personal responsibility, not only for every 
word printed in their paper but also for the methods by which information is gathered, the 
judgments made about intrusion into private matters and the culture that operates in their 
newsrooms. 

I note that the proposals put forward by Lord Black cover very similar ground in relation to 
internal governance and accountability. The proposals he makes in respect of the requirement 
for  an  effective  in-house  complaint  system,  an  annual  compliance  return  to  the  regulator 
and  having  a  nominated  senior  individual  with  responsibility  for  compliance,  are  entirely 
consistent with my recommendations here. As for the complications of compliance for small 
newspapers, there is no reason why this responsibility should not either be officially delegated 
to someone with other duties (provided that, in this context, they are required demonstrably 
to act independently of management) or, alternatively, a group of papers could combine to 
make a single appointment: I am not seeking to be dogmatic as to how the aim is achieved. 

1764

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKPowers

Complaints

4.29 

In order to be effective the regulatory body must have appropriate powers. There are two 
different aspects to the powers that the body should have: first, it needs to have the right 
powers  to  deal  appropriately  with  individual  complaints  about  breach  of  the  code;  and 
second, it needs to have the right powers to deal with serious or systemic standards failure.

4.30  Looking first at dealing with complaints:

I	recommend	that	the	Board	should	have	the	power	to	hear	and	decide	on	complaints	
about	breach	of	the	standards	code	by	those	who	subscribe.	The	Board	should	have	
the	power	(but	not	necessarily	in	all	cases,	depending	on	the	circumstances,	the	duty)	
to	hear	complaints	whoever	they	come	from,	whether	personally	and	directly	affected	
by	the	alleged	breach,	or	a	representative	group	affected	by	the	alleged	breach,	or	a	
third	party	seeking	to	ensure	accuracy	of	published	information.	In	the	case	of	third	
party	complaints	the	views	of	the	party	most	closely	involved	should	be	taken	into	
account.

The Board will need to have the discretion not to look into complaints if they feel that the 
complaint is without justification, is an attempt to argue a point of opinion rather than a code 
breach or is simply an attempt to lobby, but they should, as a matter of principle, have the 
power to take up any complaint that is brought to them.

4.31 

I	recommend	that	decisions	on	complaints	should	be	the	ultimate	responsibility	of	
the	Board,	advised	by	complaints	handling	officials	to	whom	appropriate	delegations	
may	be	made.

It is not for me to make specific organisational recommendations about how the body should 
be structured or the mechanism whereby disputes might be capable of resolution. There is, 
however, no reason why the Board should not establish a small complaints committee to deal 
with complaints in the first instance. 

4.32  Having said that, it is necessary to add that it is absolutely clear to me that it is unacceptable 
to have serving editors playing any role in determining the outcome of individual complaints.

I	recommend	that	serving	editors	should	not	be	members	of	any	Committee	advising	
the	Board	on	complaints	and	any	such	Committee	should	have	a	composition	broadly	
reflecting	that	of	the	main	Board,	with	a	majority	of	people	who	are	independent	of	
the	press.

Whatever arrangements are put in place for the practical handling of complaints, ultimately 
decisions must be a matter for the Board. 

4.33 

I	recommend	that	it	should	continue	to	be	the	case	that	complainants	are	able	to	
bring	complaints	free	of	charge.

This is one of the best features of the existing PCC system, which is carried over to Lord Black’s 
proposal for the future. 

1765

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKStandards

4.34  Turning now to serious and systemic concerns, it is essential that the body should have the 

power to act as a regulator.

Consequently,	 I	 recommend	 that	 the	 Board,	 being	 an	 independent	 self-regulatory	
body	should	have	authority	to	examine	issues	on	its	own	initiative	and	have	sufficient	
powers	to	carry	out	investigations	both	into	suspected	serious	or	systemic	breaches	
of	the	code	and	failures	to	comply	with	directions	of	the	Board.	Those	who	subscribe	
must	be	required	to	cooperate	with	any	such	investigation.

Again, it is unnecessary for me to make detailed recommendations on structures, but those 
carrying  out  investigations  must  have  sufficient  relevant  experience  and  expertise  and  be 
demonstrably independent of the press. Lord Black’s proposal meets many of the requirements 
set down here, but I have already made clear my concerns that this aspect of Lord Black’s 
proposal  is  so  weighed  down  with  process  that  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  the  investigative 
powers could ever be used successfully. The new regulatory body must be able to undertake 
investigations  when  and  where  it  thinks  appropriate,  and  to  rely  on  the  cooperation  of 
members. The investigation process must be simple and credible and, while I recognise the 
need for a level of reconsideration (whether by appeal or otherwise), this should be only at 
significant stages in order to ensure that the process can be operated effectively: ultimately, 
any decision is ultimately amenable to judicial review.

4.35  The new regulatory body should, as the PCC currently does, act on behalf of individuals to 
ask the press to stay away when requested to do so, and may choose to provide an advisory 
service to editors in relation to consideration of the public interest in taking particular actions.

4.36 

Remedies and sanctions 
In the same way as with powers, this section breaks down in to two parts: the first relates to 
the remedies that the regulator can award to individuals in relation to breaches of standards 
that have affected them, and the second relates to the sanctions that the regulator should be 
able to impose in relation to breaches of standards.

I	recommend	that	the	Board	should	have	both	the	power	and	a	duty	to	ensure	that	all	
breaches	of	the	standards	code	that	it	considers	are	recorded	as	such	and	that	proper	
data	is	kept	that	records	the	extent	to	which	complaints	have	been	made	and	their	
outcome;	this	information	should	be	made	available	to	the	public	in	a	way	that	allows	
understanding	of	the	compliance	record	of	each	title.	

4.37 

In the first case of complaints:

I	recommend	that	the	Board	should	have	the	power	to	direct	appropriate	remedial	
action	 for	 breach	 of	 standards	 and	 the	 publication	 of	 corrections	 and	 apologies.	
Although	 remedies	 are	 essentially	 about	 correcting	 the	 record	 for	 individuals,	 the	
power	 to	 require	 a	 correction	 and	 an	 apology	 must	 apply	 equally	 in	 relation	 to	
individual	 standards	 breaches	 (which	 the	 Board	 has	 accepted)	 and	 to	 groups	 of	
people	(or	matters	of	fact)	where	there	is	no	single	identifiable	individual	who	has	
been	affected.

1766

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKIt should, of course, be the subject of discussion between the complainant and the title but, 
in the end:

I	recommend	that	the	power	to	direct	the	nature,	extent	and	placement	of	apologies	
should	lie	with	the	Board.

4.38  Turning to the second case:

I	 recommend	 that	 the	 Board	 should	 have	 the	 power	 to	 impose	 appropriate	 and	
proportionate	sanctions	(including	financial	sanctions	up	to	1%	of	turnover,	with	a	
maximum	of	£1million),48	on	any	subscriber	found	to	be	responsible	for	serious	or	
systemic	breaches	of	the	standards	code	or	governance	requirements	of	the	body.	
The	sanctions	that	should	be	available	should	include	power	to	require	publication	
of	corrections,	if	the	breaches	relate	to	accuracy,	or	apologies	if	the	breaches	relate	
to	 other	 provisions	 of	 the	 code.	 Financial	 sanctions	 should	 be	 appropriate	 and	
proportionate. 

4.39 

It is important that the existence and use of financial sanctions should be transparent, in 
order to encourage effective compliance with the system. It is equally important to consider 
what would happen to any financial penalties levied. In a statutory regulatory system such 
penalties would be paid into the consolidated fund. This is obviously inappropriate in the 
case of a self-regulatory body. However, if the body were to be able to draw on fines to meet 
its ongoing costs there would be an inappropriate incentive on the body to levy fines. The 
solution proposed by Lord Black is that a ring-fenced enforcement fund should be established, 
with fines being used only to finance investigations into systemic or significant breaches. This 
approach seems to me to be an acceptable way of dealing with the issue.

4.40  For the avoidance of doubt:

I	recommend	that	the	Board	should	not	have	the	power	to	prevent	publication	of	any	
material,	by	anyone,	at	any	time	although	(in	its	discretion)	should	be	able	to	offer	
a	service	of	advice	to	editors	of	subscribing	publications	relating	to	code	compliance	
which	 editors,	 in	 their	 discretion,	 can	 deploy	 in	 civil	 proceedings	 arising	 out	 of	
publication.

In that way, there is potentially the opportunity for the regulatory body, should the need arise, 
to give reasoned opinions on issues brought to them by editors, or by individuals concerned 
about  potential  publication  of  a  matter,  that  might  provide  explanation  and  context  and 
thereby assist the court in any subsequent consideration of the matter. 

4.41  Any material that generates a greater practical understanding of the approach to decisions 
made by editors and the constraints under which they are made is likely to help and I have 
little doubt that, if that context is provided by an independent regulator, it will carry real 
weight. In that way, it could help to shape the way that the courts apply the law in these 
cases. Given the often voiced concerns about the willingness of courts to grant injunctive 
relief,  supportive  context  in  this  area  might  help  both  claimants  and  publishers  better  to 
understand context and be better able to reach a fair and balanced solution to the issue of 
injunctive relief then being argued. Independent focus on the balance between Articles 8 and 
10 can only assist the thinking of all. 

48 These are the amounts suggested by Lord Black in his proposal, p12, paras 2.1-2,2, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.
uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Lord-Black-of-Brentwood-Annex-C1.pdf. There is some disagreement in the industry 
about whether these limits are equitable and reasonable: in setting up the regulator, that would be an issue that 
would have to be addressed

1767

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK4.42 

It is essential for the public confidence in the system that the Board should regularly publish 
information on the performance of the regulatory body and on the compliance records of its 
subscribers.

I	therefore	recommend	that	the	Board	should	publish	an	Annual	Report	identifying:

(a)	

(b)	

the	 body’s	 subscribers,	 identifying	 any	 significant	 changes	 in	 subscriber	
numbers;
the	number	of	complaints	it	has	handled	and	the	outcomes	reached,	both	in	
aggregate	for	the	all	subscribers	and	individually	in	relation	to	each	subscriber;
a	summary	of	any	investigations	carried	out	an	the	result	of	them;

(c)	
(d)	 a	 report	 on	 the	 adequacy	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 compliance	 processes	 and	

procedures	adopted	by	subscribers;	and
information	about	the	extent	to	which	the	arbitration	service	had	been	used.

(e)	

Arbitration service

4.43  The high cost and real complexity of civil law and procedure, as it relates to media issues, 
has  been  a  theme  running  through  this  Inquiry.  Both  complainants  and  publishers  have 
complained of how slow and expensive it is to take an issue to court. However, there are a 
substantial number of disputes every year between individuals and publishers that are about 
the  civil  rights  of  the  complainants.  Under  the  current  system  some  of  these  the  subject 
of legal action, though very few see their way through to a judgment of the court. Some 
manifest as complaints to the PCC but the complainants are often too unsure of their rights 
or do not commence proceedings because they are unable to afford (or are too concerned 
about the potential consequences of) litigation. 

4.44  The balance of power between the publishers and complainants in these cases has shifted 
over time. At one time publishers could rest secure in the knowledge that only the very rich 
and very determined would be able to make a challenge in relation to defamation or privacy. 
Then the introduction of Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs) and after the event insurance 
changed the balance and ordinary people were able to make claims. Some high profile claims 
were made, not least with regard to phone hacking, and many complainants were successful 
in their actions. But the balance is now moving back, with the new changes to the CFA regime, 
meaning  that  individuals  will  no  longer  be  able  to  take  action  without  fear  of  potentially 
impossibly damaging costs: this problem has been examined in detail and is an area that is 
very likely to come under further scrutiny.49 

4.45 

4.46 

It  is  self  evident  that  this  situation  is  far  from  ideal.  What  is  needed  is  a  quick,  fair  and 
inexpensive system for resolving these disputes. Of course, no one can be forced to give up 
their right to go to court in pursuit, or for the protection, of their rights. However, that does 
not argue against the need for some arbitral system to be available.

I	recommend	that	the	Board	should	provide	an	arbitral	process	in	relation	to	civil	legal	
claims	against	subscribers,	drawing	on	independent	legal	experts	of	high	reputation	
and	ability	on	a	cost-only	basis	to	the	subscribing	member:	it	should	not	be	difficult	to	
provide	such	expertise,	not	only	from	those	who	have	retired	from	the	Bench	but	also	
from	the	most	senior	ranks	of	the	legal	profession.	The	process	should	be	fair,	quick	
and	inexpensive,	inquisitorial	and	free	for	complainants	to	use	(save	for	a	power	to	
make	an	adverse	order	for	the	costs	of	the	arbitrator	if	proceedings	are	frivolous	or

49 Part J Chapter 3

1768

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKvexatious).	 The	 arbitrator	 must	 have	 the	 power	 to	 hold	 hearings	 where	 necessary	
but,	equally,	to	dispense	with	them	where	it	is	not	necessary.	The	process	must	have	
a	system	to	allow	frivolous	or	vexatious	claims	to	be	struck	out	at	an	early	stage.	

4.47  As  acknowledged  above,  neither  publishers  nor  complainants  can  be  forced  to  use  such 
a system. However, the regulator should offer publishers the right to use the system and, 
equally, all complainants should be encouraged to use it as well. I consider below how use of 
the provision of an arbitration service could be incentivised by way of costs advantages both 
for potential claimants and for publishers along with the wider benefits that it could bring. 
Mechanisms for appeal to the courts (by way of review rather than rehearing) would have to 
be acknowledged.

4.48 

It is worth repeating that the ideal outcome is a satisfactory independent regulatory body, 
established by the industry, that is able to secure the voluntary support and membership 
of the entire industry and thus able to command the support of the public. I have set out 
here the minimum requirements for a ‘satisfactory independent regulatory body’. I recognise 
that, whilst this has much in common with the model proposed by the industry, there are 
substantive differences between what I am recommending and the model put forward by 
Lord Black. The main differences are in the extent of the independence of the body from the 
industry, first in the appointments process, second in the role of serving editors and third in 
the allocation of funding. In terms of organisational structure and the contractual framework, 
there is no reason why Lord Black’s model should not be capable of adaptation to meet the 
requirements set down here if the industry were able to support such a move, and if the 
other, more substantive, changes around independence and effectiveness were made.

5.	 Encouraging	membership
5.1 

If parts of the industry were to come together to set up a body meeting the requirements set 
out above, the question must remain as to whether a sufficient proportion of the industry 
would join the body to make it an effective industry regulator. A great number of possible 
incentives  for  membership  of  an  industry  regulatory  body  have  been  put  forward  to  the 
Inquiry. They have been looked at earlier.50 Naturally I hope that the desire to be able to use 
a  kitemark signifying  compliance  with  high  standards  would  be  an  important  incentive to 
membership, but realistically I recognise that those most eager to use a standards kitemark 
are likely to be those already meeting high standards. The power of a kitemark to draw in 
those less concerned by standards is unclear. I have already made clear my view of some of 
the other potential incentives to membership.51 In practice, it seems to me that there are 
three areas where it might be possible to craft a relatively significant benefit for publishers 
who choose to sign up to a satisfactory independent regulatory body.

5.2 

The first relates to data protection. I have already set out a number of recommendations for 
changes that I think should be made to the data protection regime to enhance the ability 
of  the  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  (ICO)  to  perform  its  functions  in  relation  to  the 
press.52 These include making it simpler for the ICO to use its existing powers to investigate 
cases of possible breaches of the legal requirements of the data protection regime, as well as 
taking a more focused approach to the promotion of standards of good practice in relation to 
handling of personal data within press organisations.

50 Part K, Chapter 4
51 Part K, Chapter 4
52 Part H, Chapter 6

1769

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKI	 recommend	 that	 in	 any	 reconsideration	 of	 the	 powers	 of	 the	 Information	
Commissioner	 (or	 replacement	 body),	 power	 is	 given	 to	 that	 body	 to	 determine	
that	 membership	 of	 a	 satisfactory	 regulatory	 body,	 which	 required	 appropriate	
governance	and	transparency	standards	from	its	members	in	relation	to	compliance	
with	data	protection	legislation	and	good	practice,	should	be	taken	into	account	when	
considering	whether	it	is	necessary	or	proportionate	to	take	any	steps	in	relation	to	a	
subscriber	to	that	body.

This is not to suggest that a different level of data protection regulation would apply to a 
publisher who was a member of a regulatory body as opposed to one who was not. On the 
contrary, the law would, naturally, apply in exactly the same way to both. The difference would 
be in the approach that it would be appropriate for the Information Commissioner to take 
to audit when, on the one hand, he sees an operation that has signed up to high standards 
of  privacy  and  data  protection  and  which  operates  effective  and  transparent  governance, 
whereas on the other hand he has no information about that company’s approach to data 
protection other than what he can find out by asking.

Second,  the  area  where  a  substantive  benefit  might  be  derived  from  membership  of  a 
regulatory body is costs in relation to the resolution of disputes. I have said already that I 
consider that it is essential that a regulatory body should offer and fair, quick and inexpensive 
arbitral system to deal with media disputes. Such a system should be of benefit to all who use 
it, cutting out a large amount of time, effort and expenditure currently engaged in litigation. 
It is not, of course, possible to deprive anyone, claimant or defendant, of their right to have 
their case heard by a court. But it is possible for the court to take account of whether either 
party has taken all possible steps to resolve the issue in a less expensive way. 

I	recommend	that	it	should	be	open	to	any	subscriber	to	a	recognised	regulatory	body	
to	rely	on	the	fact	of	their	membership	and	on	the	opportunity	it	provides	for	the	
claimant	to	use	a	fair,	fast	and	inexpensive	arbitration	service.	It	could	request	the	
court	to	encourage	the	use	of	that	system	of	arbitration	and,	equally,	to	have	regard	
to	the	availability	of	the	arbitration	system	when	considering	claims	for	costs	incurred	
by	a	claimant	who	could	have	used	the	arbitration	service.	On	the	issue	of	costs,	it	
should	equally	be	open	to	a	claimant	to	rely	on	failure	by	a	newspaper	to	subscribe	
to	the	regulator	thereby	depriving	him	or	her	of	access	to	a	fair,	fast	and	inexpensive	
arbitration	service.	Where	that	is	the	case,	in	the	exercise	of	its	discretion,	the	court	
could	take	the	view	that,	even	where	the	defendant	is	successful,	absent	unreasonable	
or	vexatious	conduct	on	the	part	of	the	claimant,	it	would	be	inappropriate	for	the	
claimant	to	be	expected	to	pay	the	costs	incurred	in	defending	the	action.	

At  one  extreme,  when  the  court  concluded  that  it  was  entirely  reasonable  for  a  claimant 
(although unsuccessful) to bring the claim, it might be possible for the court to go further 
and order that the claimant’s costs should be met by the defendant: the justification would 
be that although the claimant has not been successful, by not being a member of an industry 
regulator, the defendant had forced the claimant to use the expensive court system whereas 
an effective arbitral mechanism could have resolved the issue without the expenditure on 
costs at all.53 

5.3 

5.4 

5.5 

5.6 

5.7 

This does not need to work only one way and should not. Where a publisher is a member 
of an industry body, and therefore does offer access to an arbitration system, the claimant 
can obviously nonetheless choose to take the publisher to court instead: Article 6 demands 

53 This approach to costs is discussed further in connection with the civil law: see Part J Chapter 3

1770

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.8 

5.9 

nothing less. In this case, however, it would be open to the court to take the view that the 
claimant had deliberately chosen to take the high cost route of litigation and could refuse to 
award costs if the claimant were successful. Whether it could go further and permit the judge 
to exercise a discretion to require a claimant to meet the costs of the defendant is, perhaps, 
another matter: I do not express a view about it. 

This approach could have the effect of providing a strong incentive to publishers to join an 
independent regulatory body. I acknowledge that this may be largely an economic calculation, 
and that that calculation will be different for each title, depending on the extent to which it 
expects to face litigation and the costs it might incur in the course of that litigation. There are 
no publicly available figures that would enable me to say with confidence what the potential 
benefit to the industry is here, not least because that benefit would also depend on the cost 
of the regulator, the cost of the arbitral regime and any impact the existence of that regime 
might have on the number of cases being brought. I do, however, expect this to provide a 
genuine economic benefit to membership of a body.

Finally, I believe that it would be appropriate for it to be open to a court to award aggravated 
or  exemplary  damages  against  an  unsuccessful  defendant  who  has  not  only  failed  to 
demonstrate  a  proactive  commitment  to  high  journalistic  standards  but  also  deprived  a 
complainant of access to fast, fair and inexpensive arbitral mechanism by refusing to join an 
independent regulatory body: this would require a change to the law which I have addressed 
earlier.54

6.	 Giving	effect	to	the	incentives	
6.1 

I will say again, because it cannot be said too often, that the ideal outcome from my perspective 
is a satisfactory self organised but independent regulatory body, established by the industry, 
that is able to secure the voluntary support and membership of the entire industry and thus 
able to command the support of the public. In order to achieve that, it is necessary both 
to have a satisfactory independent regulatory body established by the industry, and that it 
should secure support from the entire industry. The incentives described in Section 4 above 
aim to build that support. However, as described above they suffer from a significant flaw. 
That  flaw  is  the  word  ‘satisfactory’  which  I  have  used  so  far  to  describe  an  independent 
regulatory system that meets the requirements set out above. 

6.2 

6.3 

The incentives described above rely on action being taken by the courts, and by the ICO, on 
the basis of a company’s membership of a body. This can only be possible if the courts and the 
ICO have a way of determining whether they should consider that a body that the company is 
a member of is ‘satisfactory’ – in other words, how can the courts tell the difference between 
a properly constituted independent regulatory body meeting all the requirements set down 
in Section 4 and a body that fails to meet some or all of those requirements but nonetheless 
holds itself out as doing so?

The only solution to this is a recognition process of some kind for the independent regulatory 
body. This brings me to ‘statutory underpinning’. There has been a lot of discussion, both 
within and outside the Inquiry, of statutory underpinning, its merits and its dangers. Close to 
home, there is an example of statutory underpinning in the Irish Press Council, which has been 
accepted without demur by several UK newspaper publishers, notably including Northern 
and Shell. In that case, there is a statute which sets out the requirements that must be met 
for a Press Council to be recognised by the Parliament, with members of the recognised Press 

54 Part I Chapter 3

1771

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKCouncil then being able to use that membership as a demonstration that they achieve certain 
standards when defending themselves in defamation litigation. Something similar (although 
not at all identical) is required in this country.

6.4 

Suffice to say, in order to meet the public concern that the organisation by the press of its 
regulation is by a body which is independent of the press, independent of Parliament and 
independent  of  the  Government,  that  fulfils  the  legitimate  requirements  of  such  a  body 
and  can  provide,  by  way  of  benefit  to  its  subscribers,  recognition  of  involvement  in  the 
maintenance of high standards of journalism:

I	recommend	that	the	law	must	identify	those	legitimate	requirements	and	provide	a	
mechanism	to	recognise	and	certify	that	a	new	body	meets	them.	

6.5 

I	recommend	that	the	responsibility	for	recognition	and	certification	of	a	regulator	
shall	rest	with	a	recognition	body.	In	its	capacity	as	the	recognition	body,	it	will	not	
be	involved	in	regulation	of	any	subscriber.

Once recognised, the regulatory body would have no further interaction with the state, or with 
the body that recognised it, other than to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements 
for recognition.

In	practice,	I	recommend	that	the	requirements	for	recognition	should	be	those	set	
out	in	Section	4	above.

If that were the case then bodies (like the ICO) would be able to be sure that any member of 
a recognised regulatory body would be required to meet basic governance requirements and 
would be following a Code that covered respect for privacy. The courts would be able to be 
sure that any member of a recognised regulatory body had ascribed to standards that met 
specified and acceptable criteria and was a member of a quick, fair and inexpensive arbitral 
scheme that anyone could use when seeking redress from them. 

The majority, though not all, of the national press has made it very clear that they regard 
statutory underpinning as unnecessary and dangerous. Some have gone further and indicated 
that they would find it unacceptable. In some cases, these same companies are quite happy 
to participate in a statutorily recognised system in Ireland. The Inquiry has heard evidence 
from all three major political parties that statutory underpinning is an option. 

The main argument that has been made against statutory underpinning or recognition is that 
any legislation touching on press standards provides the thin end of the wedge for political 
interference in the press. There is a countervailing argument that any such legislation could 
also be used to provide, for the first time, statutory protection for the freedom of the press 
from Government interference. I explore this idea further below.

Recognition process
Recognition requires a recognition process, and body to carry out that process. The legislation 
setting out the requirements for recognition would also have to set out both the process and 
who would be responsible for carrying it out. I will start with the recognition body.

6.6 

6.7 

6.8 

1772

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKThe recognition body

6.9 

The role of the recognition body is essentially an objective one. Its task would be simply to 
check that the statutory requirements have been met by the body applying for recognition. 
Having said that, it is also one that requires a degree of expertise in order to assess that the 
criteria have been met. The role would consist of:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

approving  the  independence  of  appointment  processes  (if  the  approach  above  is 
adopted);
checking  whether  bodies  applying  for  recognition  meet  the  statutory  criteria  on 
application;
periodically reviewing that recognised bodies continue to meet the statutory criteria; 
and
in specifically defined circumstances, carrying out any ad hoc reviews that a recognised 
body continues to meet the statutory criteria should the need arise.

6.10  As regards (c) and (d) above:

I	 recommend	 that	 the	 operation	 of	 any	 certified	 body	 should	 be	 reviewed	 by	 the	
recognition	body	after	two	years	and	thereafter	at	three	yearly	intervals.

The purpose of review is solely to ensure that the requirements for recognition continue to 
be satisfied. The circumstances in which an ad hoc review might be necessary could perfectly 
properly be defined restrictively.

6.11  As for who should fulfil this function, two fundamental options exist for the role of recognition 
body. One is to create a new body to undertake the role, and the second is to give the role to 
an existing body. 

6.12  A new body would have this one role and this one role only. This gives rise to an immediate 
difficulty. The recognition body has a significant on going role and it is not one that could 
be done easily by an ad hoc body. Equally it is an intermittent role, at best, and a standing 
body would have little or nothing to do most of the time. Its decisions will be potentially 
controversial and open to challenge by judicial review. If, for example, PressBoF was to come 
forward  with  its  current  proposal  and  seek  recognition,  the  recognition  body  would  have 
to refuse, because the current proposal as drafted does not meet the requirements set out 
above, and the implications of refusing an application by a body with the support of the vast 
majority of the publishing industry are significant. The recognition body would need to be 
able to demonstrate that its processes were sound, that its approach was objective and that 
its decision was grounded in evidence and was taken correctly. All this means that in order to 
do the job properly the body must be capable of running a demonstrably competent, expert 
and objective process. 

6.13  A new body with a single role would by definition be inexperienced, and might be in a weak 
position, vulnerable to press influence. The intermittent but ongoing nature of the role make 
it poorly suited to a standalone, specially appointed individual or body. The body carrying out 
this work must have the power to reach the correct decisions without being overly pressured 
by the press. This also argues against a sole purpose individual or body which would be very 
vulnerable to the sorts of antagonistic campaigns that the press are capable of mounting 
when they perceive themselves to be under threat. One way of dealing with that would be 
to support an independent individual, or panel, appointed to carry out the recognition task 
within an established body.

1773

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK6.14  This  leaves  the  option  of  giving  the  role  to  an  existing  body  or  using  an  existing  body  to 
support a new, independent, post. Options that I considered are: Parliament, the courts and 
Ofcom.  Parliament  is,  in  many  ways,  an  obvious  option.  The  Irish  Defamation  Act  adopts 
this model, with Parliament approving an order for recognition that is made by the Minister. 
However,  one  of  the  fundamental  requirements  for  the  regulatory  body  is  independence 
from  the  Government.  Any  Parliamentary  process  would  be  likely  to  be  perceived  by  the 
industry,  and  possibly  by  the  public,  as  Government  interference  in  the  independence  of 
the press. Certainly it is not obvious to me that the Government, or Parliament, have any 
particular  qualification  for  this  role  that  would  outweigh  the  negative  connotations  of  an 
independent regulatory body having to seek the approval of the Government. Indeed, it is 
worse than that because there may need to be some measure of negotiation as the industry 
seeks to resolve the challenges that are involved in creating a body that satisfies the criteria 
that  I  have  described.  The  idea  of  the  industry  negotiating  either  with  Parliament  or  the 
Government does raise what I readily perceive to be significant issues of independence.

6.15  The courts have the requisite strength to undertake the role. However, I repeat the point that 
I have just made: the nature of the recognition process, which has nothing to do with issues 
relating to editorial content, is such that what is required is an inquisitorial consideration 
of whether the criteria have been met, possibly involving discussion with the body about 
any changes which might be required in order to meet the criteria: there is no satisfactory 
mechanism by which the courts could fulfil that role. 

6.16  Ofcom has the requisite standing and expertise. However, Ofcom’s role in content regulation 
in  relation  to  broadcasting  is  likely  to  be  seen  by  some  as  a  very  significant  objection  to 
them carrying out this recognition role. This is primarily a presentational issue rather than a 
substantive one. The recognition role requires a judgment to be made only that the proposal 
satisfies the statutory requirements. For the most part, these will only touch on governance 
issues.  The  only  exception  is  that  the  recognition  body  would  be  required  to  determine 
whether  the  standards  code  met  the  statutory  requirements,  but  as  set  out  in  Section  4 
above, these requirements specify only that particular subjects should be covered but do not 
lay down any particular requirements on how they should be covered. 

6.17 

I  recognise  that  there  is  a  risk  that  this  process  could  involve  a  degree  of  subjective 
interpretation of concepts such as taking account of the rights of individuals. However, in 
reality, I have no doubt that Ofcom would consult and issue guidance on how such concepts 
should be interpreted. The decision making process would have to be transparent and, as I 
have indicated, it would be subject to judicial oversight by way of appeal or review. 

6.18  Ofcom is a statutory regulator and its Chair is appointed by the Government. However, it 
is  also  an  independent  regulator  and  its  independence  is  accepted  by  the  broadcasting, 
telecommunications and postal services industries that it regulates. In both telecommunications 
and  postal  services,  there  is  a  European  requirement  for  independent  regulation,  which 
Ofcom meets. It is worth noting that, although its role in broadcasting content regulation 
has been much talked of, Ofcom carries out a wide range of regulatory functions, including 
competition  regulation  in  communications  markets.  It  has  experience  of  the  sort  of  role 
proposed here in the many co-regulatory systems where Ofcom must approve or recognise 
the industry established regulator. It is also worth noting that Ofcom has two general duties:

•  to further the interests of citizens in communications matters; and
•  to further the interests of consumers in communications markets.55

55 s3 Communications Act 2003 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/3

1774

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK6.19  Furthermore,  in  carrying  out  those  general  duties  Ofcom  must  seek  to  reduce  regulatory 
burdens, including having regard to whether the objectives of regulation are being met by 
effective  self-regulation.  In  other  words,  although  Ofcom  is  a  statutory  regulator,  it  has  a 
statutory bias in favour of self-regulation and a statutory focus on the interests of citizens and 
consumers. A more specific duty to secure and promote freedom of speech and the freedom 
of the press in relation to the role of recognising an independent press regulatory body could 
be added should that be considered desirable.

6.20  The final option is that of some independent person or panel, a Recognition Commissioner 
or Commission, sitting within an existing body with the expertise and size to provide both the 
technical and legal support that would be needed. Obviously such a person or panel would 
need to be appointed in a way sufficiently independent from the industry and from political 
influence.  Three  questions  arise:  what  are  the  necessary  characteristics  for  a  Recognition 
Commissioner; who should appoint them; and what body would provide the administration 
and expertise to support them.

6.21 

I am going to approach the last of these questions first, because the answer has significant 
implications  for  the  first.  In  the  light  of  the  assessment  above,  I  am  inclined  to  the  view 
that the only body capable of providing an independent Recognition Commissioner with the 
necessary expertise in this matter is Ofcom. This would mean that Ofcom would provide the 
Commissioner with the necessary technical, legal and administrative expertise to undertake 
the  necessary  process  of  recognition,  but  that  the  decision  taken  would  be  that  of  the 
Commissioner himself (or the Commission), without any influence or input from the Ofcom 
Board. 

6.22  Thus the Commissioner would need to be an independent person, with experience of being 
responsible for weighing evidence and taking significant decisions, but need not have specific 
experience of the press or of regulation. He or she would have to be appointed by another 
process  independent  of  the  press,  independent  of  the  Government  and  independent  of 
the  legislature.  Again,  it  could  involve  those  who  hold  equivalent  responsibilities  in  other 
areas such as the Commissioner for Public Appointments and the Chairman of the Judicial 
Appointments Commission. 

6.23  There is no single obvious best option for a recognition body. Ofcom is by far the best qualified 
body for the role, and I do think it is important that the expertise that Ofcom holds is brought 
to bear on the recognition process. In all the circumstances:

I	 recommend	 that	 the	 role	 of	 recognition	 body,	 that	 is	 to	 say,	 to	 recognise	 and	
certify	 that	 any	 particular	 body	 satisfies	 (and,	 on	 review,	 continues	 to	 satisfy)	 the	
requirements	set	out	in	law	should	fall	on	Ofcom.	A	less	attractive	alternative	(on	the	
basis	that	any	individual	will	not	have	the	requisite	authority	or	experience	and	will	
only	be	occasionally	be	required	to	fulfil	these	functions)	is	for	the	appointment	of	an	
independent	Recognition	Commissioner	supported	by	officials	at	Ofcom.56

In either case, the decisions could be subject to appeal and would undeniably be liable to 
judicial review, so that ultimately responsibility would sit with the courts. 

56 Shami Chakrabarti has advised that she prefers this role to be fulfilled by the court but I do not see how the court, 
of its own motion, could adopt an adjudicative role in relation to certification or subsequent review. Somebody would 
have to be prepared to challenge either the extent to which the new body fulfilled the requirements of the legislation 
or the proposition that it should continue to do so. If that was Ofcom, and Ofcom raised no objection, there would be 
nothing upon which the court could adjudicate. Thus, the decision would become whether Ofcom was satisfied. A very 
similar role would be available to the court if there was an appeal from an adverse decision of Ofcom (which could 
allow a merits challenge rather than be limited to the more restrictive justification for intervention that is provided by 
judicial review

1775

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKThe recognition process

6.24  The intention is that the press and periodical industry should come together, as they have 
done under Lord Black, and bring forward a proposed body that would meet the requirements 
for recognition. There are, no doubt, details about the process that would need to be worked 
out. What I envisage is that the various industry representatives would decide to set up a 
body capable of recognition. They might want to discuss how they are approaching the task 
with Ofcom and thus ensure that there is a mutual understanding about an acceptable way 
forward.  Such  a  discussion  could  include  the  proposed  appointments  process  before  the 
key appointments are made, in order to ensure that the requirements are met at the right 
time. Indeed, I would encourage a continuing dialogue between those establishing a body 
and  Ofcom  throughout  the  process,  to  ensure  that  the  statutory  requirements  were  fully 
understood, all the while recognising the very limited role that Ofcom would have.

6.25  Once a body was fully established it would seek recognition from Ofcom, providing evidence 
of its funding agreement, governance structures and code. Ofcom would test each against 
the statutory requirements and either approve the body or raise any reasons as to why the 
requirements are not met. The body would then have the option of amending the proposal 
in  a  way  which  would  satisfy  the  statutory  requirements,  withdrawing  its  application,  or 
challenging the decision of Ofcom decision not to recognise it. Figure K7.2 shows how the 
recognition process applies to the illustrative functions of the independent body shown in 
figure K7.1. Speaking for myself, assuming that the exercise is undertaken in a way that seeks 
to fulfil that which I have described, I see no difficulty in recognition being comparatively 
straightforward.

It  is  necessary  to  address  the  question  of  how  many  bodies  Ofcom  could  recognise.  My 
starting point is that only one regulatory body should be recognised at any one time. There 
are good reasons for this. A single regulatory body would mean a common set of standards 
across the industry, ensuring that individuals knew what was expected of the press, where 
to go to if they had a problem and would not need to deal with multiple regulatory bodies if 
they had a problem that crossed many titles. A single regulatory body would have oversight 
of the whole industry (or at least as much of it as had joined the body) and would be able to 
take a view on standards across the industry, including pan title investigations into systemic 
issues. There is no risk of inconsistent decisions by different regulators effectively considering 
the same material. In Ireland, the Minister is only permitted to recognise one Press Council 
and the Inquiry has not been made aware of that causing any problems, either at the point at 
which the Press Council was recognised or subsequently.

1777

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK6.27  However, there are potential difficulties with this approach. The UK press is not particularly 
homogenous:  the  evidence  given  to  the  Inquiry  as  to  why  some  publishers  currently  sit 
outside  the  PCC  suggests  that  the  whole  industry  may  find  it  difficult  to  work  together. 
The evidence provided by editors in relation to the proposals from Lord Black show some 
differences in approach to regulation: the Guardian, The Independent and the Financial Times 
have reservations about the approach to regulation taken by PressBoF, the regional press 
are anxious not to find themselves paying for the sins of the nationals and online providers 
see themselves having little or nothing in common with the majority of the printed press. 
In Ireland, the single industry body had been formed before the Government shaped the 
legislation, and the legislation was shaped to fit the body. There is no equivalent industry 
body  in  existence  in  the  UK  now,  and,  assuming  that  this  solution  found  favour  with  the 
Government,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  one  would  emerge  in  the  few  months  between 
publication of the Report and the introduction of legislation.

6.28 

It is, therefore, conceivable that Ofcom might face multiple  bids  for the role  of  regulator. 
The legislation would have to have some way of dealing with that eventuality, even if it were 
considered to be relatively remote. The alternatives are to provide Ofcom with some means 
of selecting a single regulatory body to recognise, or giving it the power to recognise more 
than one regulatory body. The obvious, and fair, approach to choosing between competing 
bids would be for the recognition body to set a date by which bids should be received and 
hold some form of ‘beauty contest’ to see which of the bids was preferable. An alternative 
solution would be to add a new requirement that the regulatory body had to have membership 
of over 50% of the relevant industry. Another approach would simply be for the recognition 
body to recognise the first compliant body put before it.

6.29  All of these options have significant disadvantages. A ‘beauty parade’ would lead to Ofcom 
having to identify criteria on which it would select and apply subjective judgments over and 
above the application of the statutory requirements approved by Parliament. This would move 
the role of recognition along the line from a mostly technical one to a wholly subjective one. 
This would be likely to give rise to significant concerns about the nature of the recognition 
process and the degree of interference from Ofcom as it made its choice between potential 
regulatory bodies. 

6.30  An approach which required a minimum level of industry membership would be objective. 
However, too high a level might be too difficult for any industry grouping to achieve. Any 
proportion over 50% would make it possible for a few of the major publishers between them 
to ensure that the only proposal going forward was one led by them, irrespective of whether 
they actually had the support of the majority of the rest of the industry. It is questionable 
as to whether it would be helpful to put this much power in the hands of any of the large 
players.

6.31  Requiring the recognition body to recognise the first compliant bid would be an objective 
test. However, it is undoubtedly true that an individual organisation could run a spoiler bid, 
designed solely according to their own lights, more quickly than the majority of the industry 
would be able to reach agreement on a genuine agreed independent regulatory body. Such 
an event may be unlikely, but it is a contingency that must be guarded against. 

6.32  There are also advantages to allowing more than one regulatory body. Different parts of the 
industry might want to apply different standards. As long as the standards offered meet the 
requirements set out above, there is no obvious reason to require the whole of the industry 
to coalesce around the standards acceptable to those who wish to do the least. If parts of 
the industry wanted to aspire to higher standards it is difficult to see why they should not be 
encouraged to do that. 

1778

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK6.33  The  problems  associated  with  multiple  bodies  are  fragmentation  of  standards  and  the 
response. This is not necessarily a substantive concern. Anyone complaining to multiple titles 
will be complaining about different articles, and consequently the complaints will themselves 
be different and even a single regulatory body would have to deal with them differently. If 
the standards are voluntary it is difficult to see any principled reason why, as long as they 
meet the statutory criteria, it should be a matter of concern if they are different. There is no 
obvious reason why someone should not be entitled, for example, to pursue an apology from 
the Guardian when it purports to meet higher standards, which it would not expect to receive 
from a local newspaper or blog in relation to the same story.

6.34  The  other  concern  identified  is  about  the  difficulty  of  conducting  systemic  investigations 
across the industry if there is more than one regulator. This undoubtedly could be an issue 
and  it  is  possible  to  imagine  issues  that  would  warrant  a  pan  industry  investigation.  One 
possible solution to this problem would be to make it a criterion for recognition that the body 
would agree procedures and cooperate with any other recognised regulatory body in relation 
to complaints or systemic investigations that cover titles across regulator boundaries: they 
might even agree a common appeals mechanism to ensure consistency of approach.

6.35  A concern raised about having a single regulator is that some organisations might find that 
that  single  recognised  regulator  simply  was  not  set  up  to  accommodate  their  particular 
business:  the  standards  might  be  onerous  but  irrelevant,  the  fees  might  be  too  high,  the 
governance requirements might be too burdensome and bureaucratic for a small publisher. 
This would be important if meaningful incentives were in place to encourage membership, 
as  the  organisations  for  which  the  single  regulatory  body  was  not  appropriate  would  be 
forced to choose between forgoing the benefits of membership or submitting themselves 
to  inappropriate  regulation.  Neither  can  be  desirable.  If  multiple  bodies  were  permitted 
there would be at least the theoretical possibility that they could collectively set up their 
own compliant body more geared towards their business model. Alternatively, or as well, the 
criteria for recognition could be strengthened to explicitly require the body to offer variable 
membership categories, with appropriate governance requirements and fee structures.

6.36  On the other side of the coin is the cost: I am not in a position to challenge Lord Black’s view 
as  to  the  cost  of  the  proposals  by  PressBoF  but  I  am  sure  that  multiple  regulators  would 
duplicate cost and thus increase it for an industry that, at least in some of its manifestations, 
is suffering financial hardship. In the circumstances, I have no doubt that it would be ideal 
if the press came together to form an independent regulatory body, that would meet all of 
the requirements that I have set down here, and that would garner the support of all key 
publishers. 

6.37 

In the circumstances, I would strongly urge that it is in the best interests of the industry and 
the public that a single regulatory body should establish a single set of standards on which 
the public can rely. Failure to do so would be a sad indictment of the inability of the press to 
put commercial interest to one side, in order to come together in the public interest to create 
a system of independent regulation that would protect both freedom of expression and the 
rights  of  individuals.  However,  I  do  recognise  that,  should  that  ideal  scenario  not  arise,  it 
would be difficult to find an appropriate basis on which Ofcom could decide which of any 
competing proposals should be recognised. For this reason:

I	recommend	that	it	should	be	possible	for	the	recognition	body	to	recognise	more	
than	 one	 regulatory	 body,	 should	 more	 than	 one	 seek	 recognition	 and	 meet	 the	
criteria,	but	I	must	emphasise	that	this	is	not	an	outcome	I	would	advocate,	and	I	
would	regard	it	as	a	failure	on	the	part	of	the	industry	should	it	be	necessary	for	that	
step	to	be	taken.

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressK6.38 

Protection of freedom of the press
It has been argued that any legislation touching on press regulation would be the beginning 
of the slippery slope; that any Government would find it easier to amend an existing Act than 
to bring forward new legislation to shackle the press; that Parliament is itching to control the 
press and that this would be an opportunity to do so. I do not accept any of these arguments. 
If the history of the last 50 years on press regulation tells us anything, it tells us that Parliament 
wants nothing less than to pass legislation to regulate the press. There may have been the 
occasional siren voice expressing a contrary view but, in truth, Parliament has managed to 
avoid many opportunities to do so, despite real (and repeated) public concern about press 
behaviour and the consequences of failing to deal with it. 

6.39  There is no foundation in the suggestion that it is easier to amend an existing Act than to 
bring in a new one. Any statute only gives Government, or anyone else, the powers that are 
stated on the face of the legislation. If a statute simply provides for a recognition process for 
a press regulatory body then it can only be used for that purpose. Any attempt to introduce 
further  legislation  of  the  press  would  require  a  new  Act  of  Parliament  which  could  make 
new provisions or amend an existing Act, but it would need to be a new Act, and go through 
exactly the same processes that an Act establishing a recognition process would need to do 
today. 

6.40  Having said that, I recognise the concern expressed by many and, in order to address the 
slippery slope argument, it would be possible to use a statute setting up a recognition process 
for a regulatory body to also place an explicit duty on the Government to protect the freedom 
of the press. I have already referred earlier to an example of just this, drawing heavily from s3 
of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which would look like this:57

“GUARANTEE OF MEDIA FREEDOM

(1)  The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and other Ministers of the 
Crown and all with responsibility for matters relating to the media must uphold the 
freedom of the press and its independence from the executive.

(2)  The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport must have regard to:

 

 

 

(a)  the importance of the freedom and integrity of the media;

(b)   the right of the media and the public to receive and impart information without 

interference by public authorities;

(c)  the need to defend the independence of the media.

(3)  Interference with the activities of the media shall be lawful only insofar as it is for 
a legitimate purpose and is necessary in a democratic society, having full regard to 
the importance of media freedom in a democracy;”

6.41  Without necessarily suggesting that the clause should be worded in exactly this way, as I am 
sure there would be benefit from further consideration around the precision with which the 
intention is expressed, this seems to me to be an admirable proposal, which should provide 
some  comfort  to  those  who  have  any  concerns  about  the  risk  of  Government  decisions 
impacting adversely on the freedom of the media. In the circumstances:

57 This language is not prescriptive and neither do I intend to be prescriptive about the identity of the Secretary of 
State given primacy in this area. The draft is taken from a submission to the Inquiry by the Media Regulation Round

7.	 Summary	of	recommendations
7.1 

From the outset, I have encouraged the industry to come together to create an independent 
regulatory  regime  that  satisfies  the  need  to  provide  public  confidence.  In  my  judgment, 
the proposals so far put forward by the industry do not do that. I have been very specific 
about  where  I  consider  those  proposals  would  need  revision  in  order  meet  expectations, 
but essentially they fail in respect of independence and inclusiveness. I regard both of these 
points as absolutely essential in any new effective regulatory regime. 

7.2 

7.3 

7.4 

7.5 

I have therefore set out a vision of a voluntary independent self-organised regulatory system 
that would provide an appropriate degree of independence from the industry, coupled with 
satisfactory  powers  to  handle  complaints,  promote  and  enforce  standards,  and  deal  with 
dispute resolution.58 

In order to provide incentives to publishers to join such a voluntary independent regulatory 
system, I have recommended a series of incentives that will provide benefits to those who 
sign  up  to  the  system.59  Significantly,  these  include  consequences  in  relation  to  the  costs 
of  litigation  in  privacy,  defamation  and  other  media  cases  (even  if  successful),  if,  by  non-
membership of the regulatory system, it has deprived a claimant of a quick, fair, low cost 
arbitral route. On the basis that the court could also conclude that a publisher that did not 
subscribe and was found to have infringed the civil law rights of a claimant, it might also be 
possible to conclude that the breach is evidence of wilful disregard of standards and thereby 
potentially  lead  to  a  claim  for  exemplary  damages.  I  believe  that  these  proposals  should 
provide a powerful incentive for all publishers to want to be a part of such a self-regulatory 
system. 

In order to give effect to those incentives I have recommended legislation that underpins the 
independent self-organised regulatory system and facilitates its recognition in legal processes. 
This legislative proposal does no more than ensure an appropriate degree of independence 
and effectiveness on the part of the self-regulatory body if the incentives described are to be 
made use of. This is not, and cannot be characterised as, regulation of the press. 

A  number  of  newspaper  groups  are  fiercely  supportive  of  the  proposal  put  forward  by 
Lord Black. But others have indicated that they still have problems of principle with what is 
proposed by Lord Black, as do I. Let me be clear: even if all the national newspaper publishers 
were  to  sign  up  to  the  contracts  proposed  by  Lord  Black,  I  would  still  recommend  that 
significant changes would need to be made to that system in order to meet the requirements, 
particularly in relation to independence, that I set out above.

7.6 

Let  me  further  be  clear  that  if  an  adequately  independent  regulatory  body  were  to  be 
established  by  industry  and  signed  up  to  by  all  major  news  publishers,  I  still  recommend 
the  underpinning  statute  to  provide  for  recognition  of  that  body,  a  mechanism  to  ensure 

58 See Part K, Chapter 7 
59 See Part K, Chapter 7 

1781

Chapter 7 | Conclusions and recommendations for future regulation of the pressKthat it maintained the standards expected of it and support for an arbitration system. Such 
recognition would be important evidence that the system met legitimate public demands 
for independence, it could provide relevant evidence of systems and standards that would 
doubtless assist the courts and could also impact both on damages and in relation to costs. It 
would also be the only way to ensure that participants in the system could access the benefits 
that I have set out in relation to costs.

I repeat the refrain that what I want is for the industry to come together to organise their own 
independent regulatory system. If they cannot agree on a single regulatory system, I have 
left  the  door  open,  however  undesirable  it  might  be,  to  there  being  more  than  one  such 
independent regulatory system. I cannot see any legitimate reason why the press should not 
accept this approach and provide the public with the independent regulation that it deserves.

As for the challenge that this goes too far, I simply do not accept that these provisions will 
have a chilling effect on free speech or press freedom. Neither do I accept that politicians 
will be more willing and able to amend the provisions which I have suggested (as opposed 
to legislating afresh which is always open to them). I reject the suggestion that it will cause a 
degeneration of the rights of the press or a descent into state control. 

I have made it clear that I firmly believe it is in the best interest of the public and the industry 
that an independent self organised regulatory body is set up, and recognised in statute so 
that its members can benefit from the legal privileges that would go with membership. Given 
the public appetite for some accountability of the press, I do not think that either the victims 
or the public would understand if the industry did not grasp this opportunity. Neither would 
they understand if I were not to consider the consequences of the industry failing to deliver 
the independent regulation that is required. 

7.7 

7.8 

7.9 

7.10  Unfortunately there may be some in the industry who it presently appears would not consider 
going beyond the present PCC proposals. If that is the case, I have set out in the next Chapter 
the options that I believe would be open to (and necessary for) the Government to pursue. 
Suffice to say, bearing in mind my duty to consider the interests of the public, my view is that 
there would then be no alternative but to provide in legislation for a backstop regulator to 
apply and enforce a Code. 

7.11 

It would be a great pity, however, if the intransigence of a few resulted in the imposition of a 
system which everyone in the industry has said they do not want and which, in all probability, 
very few others would actually want to see in place. This is not an explicit recommendation 
that I am making: whether it becomes necessary to take the proposition further, in the public 
interest, depends on the press. 

7.12  Rather,  I  would  much  prefer  that  the  focus  of  all  concerned  should  be  on  attempting  to 
deliver the effective self regulation that I have set out. In my judgment, this provides the 
least intrusive method of ensuring some form of adequate independent regulatory oversight 
of press standards for the future. Possibly for the first time in our history, it provides real 
incentives for the press to organise and thus deliver genuine effective independent regulation 
in the public interest.

1782

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKCHAPTER 8 
THE ALTERNATIVES

1.  The issue
1.1 

I have indicated above that a new regulatory regime needs to cover all main news publishers 
if  it  is  to  be  effective,1  and  I  have  recommended  a  model  for  an  effective  independent 
self-regulatory  system  which  I  very  much  hope  will  be  taken  forward  by  the  industry  and 
Government and which I hope will secure the support of the whole industry.

1.2 

1.3 

1.4 

However, should that not be the case, and only in those circumstances, there would be a need 
for some mechanism to ensure that the advantages that the press enjoy in the public interest 
are matched by responsibilities that are owed to the public. In other words, there should be 
some way that the press can be held to account on behalf of the public for the way it goes 
about its business. I have been clear that it is my hope and expectation that this situation 
will not arise. It can only do so if the press fails to deliver the independent regulation that is 
required and that the public have a right to demand. If, however, the industry were unwilling, 
or unable, to come forward with a credible proposal for independent regulation then it would 
have demonstrated sufficient disregard for the public interest to have established that self-
organised regulation simply is not an effective option. This Chapter looks at the issues that 
would have to be addressed in order to provide such a mechanism and identifies the possible 
solutions.

I ought to make it clear that I do not believe that an approach involving direct independent 
regulation necessarily constitutes a “freedom of expression Armageddon” (to use the Rt Hon 
Kenneth Clarke MP’s expression). I repeat that the issue arises only if the press deliberately 
refuse  to  set up  a regulatory process that is  undeniably  independent of  Government and 
Parliament but is, equally, independent of the press itself; or, if such a system is set up but 
does not have the support of the whole industry.

I set out here a very brief analysis of the issues which I think logically arise in that eventuality. 
I do so for reasons of completeness, and so that no reader of this Report is unaware of the 
inescapable context which forms the background to the recommendations that I have made 
in the previous Chapter. There are no recommendations in this Chapter; it is simply a short 
overview of the logical alternatives, as I see them, to the implementation of the model I have 
put forward.

2.	 The	questions
1.5 

It is extremely easy to say that everyone must participate in a new regulatory system, and 
relatively easy to fall back on the idea that, if they refuse, some type of statutory provision 
may be necessary to ensure that outcome. It is more difficult to determine the shape and 
substance of that statutory provision. I note that very few of the witnesses to the Inquiry 
have addressed themselves to this question at all, even where they accept that legislation 
might well be needed. The first point to make is that any form of compulsion would require 
legislation. Undeniably, it is statutory regulation in stark form.

2.1 

There are essentially four questions that need to be addressed in considering what statutory 
provision might be required: 

(a)  what standards should be complied with? 
(b)  what should be the consequences of failure to comply?
(c) 
(d)  who should these provisions apply to?

how should these consequences be applied? and; 

3.	 What	standards	should	be	complied	with?
3.1 

I  have  already  made  it  clear  that  I  have  no  intention  of  trying  to  define  the  standards  of 
press conduct and ethics that should be applied. That is rightly a matter for an independent 
regulatory body, acting with the advice of the industry and following consultation with the 
public and others with relevant interests. I have also made it clear that I expect the standards 
set by an independent regulatory body to cover governance and compliance procedures as 
well as conduct and ethical issues. The recommendations set out above establish the specific 
requirements  that  I  consider  should  be  met  by  an  independent  regulatory  system  in  this 
regard. 

3.2 

The issue considered here is the standard to be expected of those who choose to stay outside 
of a self-organised independent system that meets those criteria, or in the event that no such 
system emerged. There are a number of possible approaches. 

Enforcing legal requirements

3.3 

3.4 

3.5 

It has been argued that what is needed is not regulation of standards, but enforcement of 
the law. I have explained why simple enforcement of the law, either through the application 
of the criminal law or by civil proceedings through the courts, will not be a realistic solution 
to most of the problems identified by the Inquiry.2 Having said that, those who argue for law 
enforcement alone are correct that, for the most part, the contents of any likely ‘standards 
code’ are already, at a basic level, covered by the law.

However,  the  virtue  of  an  effective  regulatory  system  is  that,  even  if  it  does  not  seek  to 
set  standards  at  a  level  beyond  the  basic  requirements  of  the  law,  it  would  be  possible 
to enforce those rights in a way that is more flexible and may not otherwise be possible. 
Where a publisher declines to be part of an effective regulatory system, there is currently 
no mechanism for effective enforcement even of standards equivalent to the law beyond 
reporting the matter to the police (if there is a basis for contending that the complaint is one 
of crime) or commencing civil proceedings.

Under this analysis, the harm that arises as a result of publications choosing to sit outside a 
regulatory system, or the lack of existence of a regulatory system, is that victims are obliged 
to  fall  back  on  the  civil  law  process  which  is  not  designed  to  provide  the  type  of  speedy 
redress or rectification that is available to a regulator, but can be both slow and unsatisfactory; 
furthermore, it is unlikely to be a possible route for any other than the very rich and there is 
no external monitoring of compliance with civil and criminal legal requirements. 

3.6 

It might reasonably be suggested that no publisher should be above the law, and that the 
simplest  way  of  enforcing  that  principle  would  be  for  a  standards  code  that  simply  looks 

2  Part J, Chapters 2 and 3

1784

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKto  reflect  the  existing  law  in  terms  of  standards  to  apply  and  then  rigorously  enforces 
those standards. Essentially, if that was to be the case, what is suggested is that a statutory 
regulator should be empowered to undertake regulatory enforcement of relevant civil rights 
and  criminal  wrongs  with  a  zero-tolerance  approach.  By  ‘regulatory  enforcement’  I  mean 
that the statutory body would: establish a standards code that requires no more or less than 
compliance with legal obligations; determine whether standards have been breached; and 
apply appropriate sanctions. This rigorous regulatory enforcement would sit alongside the 
existing  mechanisms  of  law  enforcement  but  would  be  applied  by  the  regulator,  not  the 
courts.  All  decisions  taken  by  the  regulator  could  be  subject  to  appeal  to  the  courts  and 
would, in any case, be subject to challenge by judicial review. 

3.7 

In order to be able to exercise such a role effectively the regulator responsible would need 
new statutory powers to set and enforce regulatory standards that do not exceed the limits 
of  the  law.  In  addition,  it  would  need  powers  to  obtain  information  about  compliance. 
These powers could take the form of the ability to conduct an audit to examine and make 
recommendations about the compliance systems that a company has in place. The regulator 
would also need to be given investigatory powers in order to follow up complaints or reasoned 
suspicion of breach of law. These powers might include the power to call for documents and 
to hold hearings. In relation to enforcement powers, the regulator could be given the power 
to require publication of corrections and apologies in relation to defamatory material, and 
the power to impose regulatory fines (or civil penalties) in respect of defamation and other 
breaches of law. 

3.8 

Some of these powers would be entirely new regulatory enforcement powers for existing 
law.  Others,  for  example  in  relation  to  data  privacy  breaches,  exist  already,  or  would  do 
so if the recommendations that I have made in relation to the reform of the Information 
Commissioner and the Data Protection Act are accepted. A good deal more work would be 
required to identify the specific areas of law that such powers should cover and precisely 
what powers such a regulator should have.

3.9 

A  regulatory  system  would  offer  access  to  victims  to  pursue  their  rights,  albeit  without 
necessarily pursuing a claim for the compensation that the law might allow; it could provide 
a mechanism for standards oversight that criminal law enforcement cannot provide.

Enforcing independently set standards

3.10  Many of the examples of unacceptable press behaviour that the Inquiry has seen concern 
inaccuracy that is harmful to individuals or the public at large, and breaches of privacy of one 
sort or another. Most clauses of the current Editors’ Code fall under one of those headings or 
the other. Those that do not (those relating, for example to reporting of crime and payment to 
witnesses and criminals) are in areas covered by criminal law. It might, therefore, be argued, 
that an ethical standards code is unlikely to offer the public any more protection than the civil 
and criminal law, taken together, already do. This is not strictly true. 

3.11 

In the first place, the law only covers accuracy of published material to the extent that want 
of accuracy is defamatory (the threshold for which is presently under consideration in the 
Defamation Bill) or a contravention of the data protection regime. It is quite clear that the 
public  interest  in  accuracy  goes  much  wider  than  the  case  of  personal  information,  and  I 
would expect an independent standards code to set that expectation. There is, however, no 
legal mechanism to correct an inaccuracy other then when it is defamatory or a breach of 
the Data Protection Act. The current Editors’ Code also makes provision for handling cases 
involving grief and shock in a sensitive way where there is no underlying legal requirement 

1785

Chapter 8 | The AlternativesK(unless a claim could be pursued for breach of privacy). In other areas, such as harassment, 
the current Code provisions cover ground where there are legal standards but the Code does 
not  necessarily  track  those  legal  standards  exactly,  nor  would  it  necessarily  be  desirable 
that it should do so. There are therefore gaps in the protection of the public interest, and in 
reasonable expectations of press standards, which the substantive law does not cover.

3.12  Where a recognised independent regulatory system did exist, there would be one or more 
recognised independently-set standards codes in existence. These would have been subject 
to public consultation. It would be perfectly possible to apply the most appropriate of these 
directly to a publisher outside the system. This is broadly analogous to the model adopted by 
Ofcom in relation to the Advertising Standards Authority, where Ofcom will, if necessary, take 
enforcement action against broadcasters who are in breach of the ASA broadcasting code. 
If there were no such body at all, the regulator would have to issue its own code, doubtless 
having given the industry the opportunity to provide input from the start and, ultimately, 
following open and transparent consultation both with the industry and the public. 

4.	 What	consequences	should	apply	for	breach?
4.1 

This is the main question that defines the impact of any compulsory regulation. What should 
apply, and to whom it should apply are, to some extent, matters of technical detail. What 
happens  in  respect  of  breach  defines  the  nature  of  the  statutory  intervention.  For  some 
regulators, there is a power to disqualify or ban: it goes without saying that, if a publisher 
could be banned from publication as a result of breach, that would amount to a licensing 
regime for the press which would be entirely unacceptable. 

4.2 

4.3 

4.4 

The  options  that  I  consider  below  are  only  those  that  I  believe  would  be  acceptable  in  a 
democratic society and all respect the right of any publisher to publish any material. There 
is nothing here that would apply any form of prior restraint, or require any permission, in 
relation to publication. None of the options includes any form of state intervention in the 
content published (save to the extent that a requirement to publish a correction impacts on 
content), or even in setting any standards that might apply to any content published.3 These 
options relate solely to consequences after the event where standards (howsoever defined) 
have been breached. 

Other than the first, which is the absence of consequences and included simply for the sake 
of completeness, each of these approaches would rely on the existence of statutory backstop 
regulator of some kind. They are set out so that they can be considered by all concerned with 
this issue.

Rely solely on benefits from membership of a recognised body

If there is no backstop regulator, the only effect of non-membership of a recognised body 
would be the inability to access the benefits of that membership. Effectively, this would be 
a  ‘do  nothing’  option.  I  have  set  out  above4  the  statutory  benefits  that  I  consider  should 
apply to membership of a recognised body. These include the recognition by the courts of a 
commitment to high standards of behaviour and practice in connection with the issues that 
arise in relation to aggravated and exemplary damages and also of a willingness to participate 
in a fair, low cost, scheme to arbitrate disputes which is relevant to issues of costs.

3 If a backstop regulator has the power to require the publication of corrections and apologies this is a form of control 
of content, but only to rectify something that was previously incorrect
4 Part K, Chapter 7

1786

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK4.5 

4.6 

4.7 

4.8 

4.9 

Conversely, those who are not members of such a regulatory body would face the risk of 
failing to demonstrate a commitment to high standards of behaviour (which could provide 
material  that  justifies  the  award  of  aggravated  or  exemplary  damages)  and  adverse  costs 
consequences of failing to participate in a system which permitted claimants to pursue their 
rights in a fair, low cost system of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Thus, if my earlier 
recommendations  are  accepted,  non-members  might  find  that  the  court  exercises  its 
discretion against making an order for costs even in the event that they had succeeded in a 
privacy or defamation defence. 

These  are,  of  course,  consequences  of  not  joining  a  regulatory  system;  they  are  not 
consequences attached to specific breaches of standards. The only mechanism for an individual 
to challenge a publisher outside the regulatory system would be by legal challenges relating 
to defamation, privacy or data protection. In the context of the changes to conditional fees, 
this is unlikely to be a route open to most people, which is why I have recommended that if 
no such scheme is set up, the Government should revisit the proposals made by Lord Justice 
Jackson for one way qualified costs shifting.

Name and shame

The first and least intrusive approach for a backstop regulator would be no more than an 
obligation  and  ability  to  monitor  the  performance  of  non-member  publishers  against  the 
relevant standards and governance requirements, and to make its findings public. In order 
to be able to make meaningful reports, such a body would need to have the power to hear 
complaints from individuals and reach conclusions on whether standards had been breached. 
In order to provide any broader standards oversight, the body would need to have the power 
to  investigate  serious  or  systemic  breaches  of  standards  and  to  require  information  from 
publishers to facilitate that. 

On this basis, the regulatory backstop would be unable to make any requirement of a publisher 
or impose any remedy for an individual: the only recourse for that individual would remain 
litigation. However, the body would itself be able to publish its conclusions on complaints and 
make public any concerns it had about standards in relevant publishers. A report of this sort 
could formally be made to Parliament.

Complainants champion

There is also the potential for an entirely different approach. In the absence of some sort 
of regulatory intervention, the only option open to an individual would be litigation, if that 
were appropriate. It is theoretically possible for a backstop regulator (who could assume the 
naming and shaming role identified above) to take on the role of supporting complainants 
in taking legal action. A more extreme approach would be for the backstop regulator to take 
legal action on behalf of complainants. 

4.10  There are, however, two rather obvious problems with this proposal. The first is the cost. Even 
with the cost proposals set out in Section 4, it is likely that this would be an expensive option. 
It is inevitable that sometimes claims would fail; indeed, it would be a poor service if the 
only claims the regulator pursued were those guaranteed to succeed. The regulator would 
need some means of determining which cases to pursue as it would be both impractical and 
improper to take forward any complaint, however unlikely to succeed. 

4.11  The  second  substantive  problem  here  is  that  the  state,  however  constituted,  does  not 
generally seek to enforce the civil rights of citizens and it is difficult to see why it should do so 

1787

Chapter 8 | The AlternativesKin this area, as opposed to many others. There are serious concerns about access to justice in 
a wide variety of contexts; the legal aid budget is already overstretched, with the areas of law 
in which legal assistance is provided under constant review. It is extremely difficult to see why 
the state should be prepared to enforce these (as opposed to many other) private law rights. 

Apply standards with enforcement powers

4.12  The final level would simply be to apply standards to all news publishers in the same way. This 
could be achieved in one of two ways. The first would be to require all relevant publishers to be 
bound by a recognised independent regulatory body such as the type I have recommended. 
However, this approach is not itself without difficulty for a number of reasons. 

4.13  First, it is important to emphasise that if the press come together to organise an independent 
regulatory body (albeit in such a way that satisfied certain statutory requirements) the result 
is not itself a statutory body of any sort. It will be recognised by statute but it will not have any 
statutory powers. The Report does not propose statutory regulation of the press but, rather, 
self-organised independent regulation of the press, both elements of which (self organised 
and independent) are significant. It means that it would be wrong to give the body statutory 
jurisdiction  of  any  sort.  Equally,  it  would  be  wrong  to  require  any  individual  publisher  to 
become a member of a ‘self-organised’ body organised by others. 

4.14  The  alternative,  second  way  is  that  some  other  regulatory  body  (a  ‘backstop  regulator’) 
should apply a standards code directly to press publishers who choose not to become part 
of a recognised system. Under this approach the backstop regulator would need, by statute, 
to  be  given  enforcement  powers  to  carry  out  investigations,  to  require  publication  and 
placement of corrections and apologies, and to levy fines in respect of serious or systemic 
breaches and in default of compliance with its orders. The backstop regulator would then be 
in a position to apply an appropriate level of regulation to those who do not voluntarily sign 
up to a recognised independent system. As described above, the standards applied could be 
a code that simply reflects the requirements of the law, or it could go further and apply the 
most appropriate code or, in default, a code that it had prepared after suitable consultation.

4.15 

It is important to repeat that no backstop regulator should be given any powers over published 
content, except in relation to apologies and corrections. At no point should the regulator be 
able  to  prevent  publication  of  content.  The  regulator  would  have  no  right  to  see  content 
ahead of publication and no right to require the publication of any content other than in 
respect  of  apologies  and  corrections.  This  would  not  be  statutory  regulation  of  what  the 
press could publish; rather, it would represent an after the fact review of press behaviour.

5.	 How	should	any	consequences	be	applied?
5.1 

I  identified  earlier  that  all  options  (except  for  ‘do  nothing’)  would  require  a  backstop 
regulatory body to undertake the proposed regulatory role. The role requires a strong, expert 
organisation, capable both of understanding the balance between Article 8 and Article 10 
rights of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and of withstanding the pressure 
that the press would be bound to place on anyone in this position.

5.2 

An obvious answer would be that Ofcom should be given the responsibility of the role, not 
least because it is an established regulator, well able to understand the issues and address 
them. I am aware of the attitude of the press towards Ofcom but there is absolutely nothing 

1788

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK5.3 

5.4 

5.5 

5.6 

5.7 

in the way in which I have seen that it exercises its regulatory functions to suggest that it does 
not do so entirely appropriately and fully in accordance with its legislative mandate. 

Ofcom has an internationally high reputation5 as a telecommunications regulator, and has 
been  described  by  the  Rt  Hon  Ed  Vaizey  MP,  Minister  for  Culture,  Communications  and 
Creative Industries, as ‘doing an outstanding job’.6 The broadcasters who have given evidence 
to  the  Inquiry  have  not  suggested  that  Ofcom  (which  directly  regulates  the  independent 
broadcasters, occupying a slightly different position in relation to the BBC) has ever exercised 
the  slightest  chilling  effect  in  relation  to  the  many  examples  of  splendid  investigative 
journalism that have been carried out over many years. For the avoidance of doubt, I am 
equally clear that Ofcom would have no difficulty approaching its task with an eye to the very 
different requirements of press regulation as contrasted with broadcast regulation, not least 
in relation to the difference of position as to political neutrality. 

Ofcom would have to take on additional expertise from print journalism to assist in the task 
but, given that many broadcast journalists have also worked in the press, I do not believe that 
Ofcom would be starting from a blank sheet. Much expertise is available to it and I have no 
doubt that it could perform the oversight task with a light touch but be ready to deal with 
egregious examples of conduct as and when it is necessary to do so. Both in the seminar 
and in evidence, the Chair, Dr Colette Bowe and Ed Richards, the chief executive of Ofcom, 
demonstrated a clear understanding of the line and I reject the suggestion that regulation by 
Ofcom would mean the end of the free press or descent into state control of content. 

Having  identified  Ofcom  as  the  obvious  answer,  I  must  recognise  that  I  have  already 
recommended that Ofcom should act as that body responsible for recognition and audit of 
independent regulatory press standards bodies. It might be suggested, therefore, that it was 
undesirable for one body to be responsible both for advising on the adequacy of the model 
for independent regulation that has been set up (against the statutory requirements) and, 
ultimately, if all else fails, for delivering the regulation itself. 

The  issue  could  be  argued  both  ways.  First,  it  might  be  said  that  Ofcom  could  reject  an 
independent regulator in order to take on the role of direct regulation. Second, and in quite 
the opposite direction, it is just as plausible to argue that Ofcom might actually be inclined 
to approve any independent regulator that comes forward in order to avoid taking on highly 
controversial role of regulating the press directly. 

For my part, I do not believe that this dual role necessarily creates any real difficulty. I do 
not see why it should not be possible to require Ofcom at all times to aim for independent 
self-organised  regulation,  whilst  nonetheless  having  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  how  any 
recognised regulator meets the statutory criteria. As a statutory regulator, Ofcom is required 
to operate with full transparency and could be obliged to publish not only its decisions on 
recognition, but also the reasoning for its decisions, thus ensuring that there is no opportunity 
for competing incentives in relation to a backstop regulatory role to influence a decision on 
recognition of an independent regulator.

5.8 

For the sake of completeness I should mention what could be the alternatives. First, it would 
be possible to extend the remit of the Information Commissioner. There are some advantages

speeches/8811.aspx

1789

Chapter 8 | The AlternativesKto this idea. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has many of the relevant powers 
already, as well as the expertise in balancing the considerations raised by Articles 8 and 10 
of the ECHR. However, for the reasons I have set out in Part H, I do not see this as an obvious 
solution. Any attempt to give this role to the ICO would require restructuring and substantial 
strengthening of the office, together with giving the Information Commissioner new duties 
and responsibilities to ensure that sufficient priority was given to the role. 

5.9 

The final option would be to create a new regulator to undertake the role. To my mind, this 
is the least satisfactory. Creating a new, self-standing, authority would take time. It would be 
likely to be the most expensive option; it would have no established authority or reputation. 
Without appropriate support, it would also be vulnerable to pressure.

6.	 To	whom	should	any	provision	apply?
6.1 

I have referred throughout this section to ‘news publishers’. In practice if there were to be 
any requirement for certain organisations to meet prescribed standards in carrying out their 
activities, then it would be necessary to define quite precisely who those organisations are. 
There are two elements to this question. The first, and most basic, is how it is possible to 
distinguish the types of organisation that it is considered should be included within a new 
regulatory  system.  The  second,  once  a  definition  has  been  decided,  is  whether  everyone 
within that definition should be covered, or whether there is an argument for some sort of 
size threshold. I will deal with these two issues separately.

Definitions

6.2 

6.3 

The Inquiry has had limited help on this matter from witnesses. Some have argued that the 
difficulty of defining who should be covered by any legislation is a sufficient argument in itself 
for not imposing a legislative solution. 

Current definitions are an obvious starting point. Membership of the PCC is purely voluntary 
and  the  PCC  says7  that  it  deals  with  editorially  controlled  material  in  UK  newspapers  and 
magazines and their websites. The PCC does not cover any newspapers or magazines that 
do not subscribe to the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF), and hence has not had to grapple 
with  the  issue  of  definitions  in  relation  to  whether  a  particular  publication  should  be  a 
member if it does not wish to do so. National newspapers pay the levy through the National 
Periodical Association, whilst regional newspapers and magazines are invoiced individually.8 
No evidence is available on how PressBoF identifies publications to invoice, though it seems 
likely that this is done via the relevant industry bodies, or what they do when publications do 
not choose to pay. There is no publicly available list of those publications that are covered by 
the PCC, nor any list of publications which are not.

6.4 

One,  albeit  partial,  source  would  be  a  definition  of  ‘newspaper’  or  ‘the  press’.  Dictionary 
definitions of ‘a newspaper’ tend to include reference to the fact that it is printed,9 that it 
is published at regular intervals, and that content includes articles on the news, editorials, 
features,  reviews  and  advertisements.  Definitions  of  the  ‘press’  tend  simply  to  refer  to 
publications  and  periodicals.  Definitions  of  the  media  go  much  more  widely  and  bring  in

9  There are definitions of ‘newspaper in the ‘Newspaper Registration and Libel Act 1881, and in guidance issues by

6.8 

broadcasting and, sometimes, the internet. An approach based on defining terms of this sort 
does not, therefore, appear promising.

An alternative approach, in seeking to identify the scope and coverage of a new regulatory 
system,  would  be  to  identify  what  activity  it  is  that  gives  rise  to  the  need  for  regulation. 
The harm that the Inquiry has heard described relates primarily to the process of gathering 
information about individuals, the use of private information and the publication of inaccurate 
information. It is these areas (conduct in the gathering of information, respect for privacy, 
and accuracy) that I have recommended should by covered by a standards code in the new 
regulatory system. It follows that the coverage of a new regulatory system should encompass 
those who undertake activities likely to involve those three processes. It may therefore be 
appropriate  to  attempt  to  build  a  definition  based  around:  the  gathering  of  information 
about people and current affairs, for the purpose of, or in relation to, publication of news and 
information; and the publication of information about people and current affairs. 

One way of looking at this would be to develop a concept of ‘press like services’ along the 
model already used in relation to audiovisual media services, where regulation applies to ‘TV-
like services’. Whether or not a service fell within the definition would be determined by any 
backstop regulator, but subject to appeal or review.10

A definition of this sort would be targeted on the behaviour that gives rise to concern and 
would certainly include newspapers and relevant magazines. Such a definition should also 
apply  to  those  to  whom  information  gathering  is  subcontracted,  such  as  picture  agencies 
and private investigators (although only when working for clients who would themselves be 
included by virtue of their publication activities). 

As set out above, however, the definition would also include broadcasters and internet sites 
which cover news or celebrity issues. Whilst it is important to ensure that the coverage of a 
new regulatory system is sufficiently wide to prevent it being evaded purely by restructuring or 
redefining what an organisation does, it is also important to avoid any conflict or unnecessary 
and unhelpful overlap between regulatory systems. In this context, it would be sensible to 
say that any activities that are regulated by Ofcom under the Broadcasting Code, or by the 
Authority for Television on Demand (ATVOD), under the Audio Visual Media Services (AVMS) 
Directive,  should  not  fall  to  be  regulated  under  the  new  system.  It  would  clearly  be  very 
important, however, for the boundaries between those systems and the new system to be 
looked at very carefully, and for the relevant regulators to work together to avoid conflict or 
gaps in coverage.

A size threshold

6.9 

Arguments have been made from two perspectives about the extent to which any regulatory 
system should apply to companies of all sizes engaged in ‘press like services’. First, and at a 
level of regulatory policy, a number of regulators have made the case that regulation should 
be  proportionate  and  that  some  form  of  de  minimis  exemption  would  be  appropriate  to 
exempt those companies that are so small that the regulatory requirements would not be a 
proportionate response to the potential harm caused by unregulated behaviour. 

6.10  Second, it has been argued that it makes sense to concentrate any required remedies on large 

companies: 11

10 Part K, Chapter 7
11 p74, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-by-Media-Standards-Trust.pdf

1791

Chapter 8 | The AlternativesK“Large news publishers have voices far louder, with significantly greater impact than 
any individual. They have the power to frame and influence public opinion and public 
understanding. They also have exceptional power to seriously harm private citizens 
through their influence.”

It is further argued that making some form of standards regulation compulsory only for large 
companies, as well as concentrating the remedy on the source of the harm, would distinguish 
between freedom of expression, which would remain entirely unconstrained, and ‘corporate 
speech’ which ‘due to its power and influence ought to be accountable’.12

6.11  The  arguments  for  some  form  of  de  minimis  exemption  are  strong.  There  will  be  few 
who think that a parish magazine or small newsletter should be compulsorily subject to a 
regulatory system. Such publications will simply never have the resources to join a regulatory 
body, or to provide the sort of internal governance systems and compliance returns that are 
appropriate for much larger organisations. Equally, they are unlikely to give rise to the level 
of harm that a substantially larger publisher might. On the one hand, it is possible for a very 
small organisation to make some defamatory remark or breach privacy and they are, and 
should remain, subject to the law should they do so. However, the worst harm is done to an 
individual, or society, once those inaccuracies or defamations are published and read more 
widely. The most significant damage is done by the use of the megaphone and the power of 
large brands to influence public understanding and opinion. 

6.12  Thus the principle of setting a size related limit above which regulation should apply is simple 

enough. The difficult question, inevitably, is where that limit should be set. 

6.13  This could be looked at in two ways. First, a simple economic measure could be considered. 
This could take into account revenues, market share and circulation. The Media Standards 
Trust suggests that companies meeting the definition of a small company or group for the 
purposes of the Companies Act 2006 should remain outside regulation. Another suggestion 
was that any company not large enough to be required to register for VAT should be exempt 
from regulation. 

6.14  The alternative approach would be to consider a measure based more on the impact and 
influence of a publication. I have argued that a free press is important because of the influence 
that it can have over the nation’s understanding of issues and events.13 That importance has 
attracted privileges that the press can rely on in terms of privileged access to Parliament and 
the courts, privileged protection for sources, privileged exemptions from the data protection 
regime and privileged defences in relation to defamation. It must also be the case that the 
influence and privileges of the press bring some form of accountability. 

6.15  The Inquiry has heard from editors that they are accountable to their readers, and, to no 
small extent, on a commercial basis to their shareholders or proprietors. But accountability 
to the paper’s own readership cannot be confused with accountability to the public more 
generally in relation to activities that go wider than their influence on readers: that is because 
the activities that are the subject of complaint relate to the treatment of third parties or the 
publication of inaccurate or defamatory material. 

6.16  Effective  independent  regulation  would  provide  a  level  of  accountability  in  relation  to 
standards that would not in any way interfere with the freedom of an editor to publish any 
material  that  he  or  she  wanted  to  publish,  but  would  encourage  governance  systems,  to 

12  ibid
13  Part B 

1792

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKavoid legal and standards breaches, and generate potential consequences should standards 
be breached. 

6.17  Using this rationale for independent standards regulation, it follows that, when considering 
who should not be able to opt out of standards regulation, the measure to be used should be 
a materiality threshold based on influence. The Report sets out elsewhere the issues involved 
in measuring the relevant parts of the media market to understand whether there is sufficient 
plurality in the market.14 

6.18 

In that Chapter, I refer to the various metrics that Ofcom proposes using to measure plurality, 
including  availability,  consumption  and  impact.  It  is  entirely  possible  that  some  similar 
combination  of  measures  of  influence,  in  particular  consumption  and  impact,  would  be 
appropriate  in  considering  whether  it  would  be  proportionate  for  a  news  publisher  to  be 
expected not to be able to opt out of compliance with independently set standards. 

6.19  This is a complex and technical question and my only purpose is to identify the options. Either 
of these approaches might serve as a starting point, but, if the Government were to find it 
necessary  to  put  a  system  of  backstop  regulation  in  place,  I  would  recommend  that  they 
should conduct a detailed consultation on the matter of precisely where and how the line 
should be drawn: that is precisely the type of line that Ofcom would be able to draw. 

6.20 

It is my clear view that, wherever the line is to be drawn, all the national daily and Sunday titles 
should fall within the regulatory system. Equally, regional and local titles with a significant 
readership should be included within the system. It is more difficult to be clear about what 
types of online service clearly should be inside or outside of a regulatory system. However, it 
would clearly be appropriate that websites providing news coverage aimed substantially at 
a UK audience, with a substantial stable audience should be covered by any new regulatory 
system. 

6.21  Any  definitions  would  need  to  apply  at  the  group  level,  to  ensure  that  where  there  are 
many small publications under the control of one organisation they are potentially included 
within the regulatory system. This could place differential costs of regulatory compliance on 
independent local or regional titles and those of their competitors that are part of a larger 
group. Although I recognise the need for consultation, on the face of it, it is not unreasonable 
to  expect  a  publishing  group  of  any  size  to  be  able  to  institute  appropriate  governance 
mechanisms that might not be necessary or proportionate in the case of much smaller and 
simpler operations. The aim of putting a size threshold on the regulatory system would be 
to ensure that regulation was not disproportionate and did not act as a barrier to freedom 
of expression, not to provide a route to evasion for those who should be within the system. 

7.	 My	views
7.1 

A backstop regulator would only be required if either the whole of the press industry had failed 
to accept the principle of independent regulation and thus failed to organise an independent 
body meeting the proposed statutory requirements or a significant proportion of the press 
(and, in particular, any of the national press) had refused to engage with an independent 
regulator. This would be a serious indictment of the ability and willingness of the industry 
to engage with standards regulation by any means short of direct compulsion and, as I have 
said, would undeniably reinforce the need for some statutory system of standards to be put 
in place.

Chapter 8 | The AlternativesK7.2 

7.3 

7.4 

7.5 

7.6 

7.7 

I repeat, as I have made very clear that, by a very long way, my preferred solution, and hence 
my  recommendation,  is  that  the  industry  should  come  together  to  construct  a  system  of 
independent regulation that could be recognised. If it does so, there will be no need for a 
backstop regulator. 

However, if some or all of the industry were not prepared to adopt that position, I do not 
accept  that  they  should  expect  the  public  to  settle  for  less,  much  less  escape  standards 
regulation altogether. More significantly, if the possibility exists that a significant provider 
of press like services could avoid independent regulation without consequence, then there 
would simply be no incentive for an unwilling industry collectively to deliver it. My personal 
view, therefore, is that there may be a need for the realistic prospect of a backstop regulator 
being established.

I think it is reasonable and proportionate to expect all publishers to comply with the standards 
of conduct required by the law. I also think it reasonable and proportionate to require the 
press, which enjoys many benefits in the public interest, to accept the obligations of the sort 
of public interest standards, over and above the minimum requirements of the law, which 
they have already described to some extent in their past codes, and which they purport to 
take seriously and live up to. These standards must reinforce the rights of free speech and 
of the press to pursue whatever stories that they consider appropriate in whatever way they 
see fit; they must also respect the legitimate rights and interests of the public, individually 
and collectively. 

Second, in relation to the consequences of failure to comply, I am sure that they would have 
to exist and must be real. I therefore do not consider that it would be appropriate to adopt 
the ‘do nothing’ option, relying only on generic incentives to encourage membership of an 
independent regulatory body. Neither do I consider that simple publication by a regulator of 
an adverse judgment would be sufficient. The provision of a ‘complainants champion’ service 
might be useful in relation to those who suffer breach of their civil rights by the media, but 
this would be an expensive and partial solution to the problems posed by standards breach. 
In my opinion it would be better that some statutory backstop regulator be given the powers 
to enforce standards, including powers to require publication of apologies and corrections, 
the power to investigate concerns of serious standards breach and the power to impose fines 
(proportionate to the gravity of any breach and the means to pay) in respect of serious or 
systemic breaches of standards (or failure to publish a required apology or correction). 

Third, in respect of who should apply these consequences, my clear expectation is that Ofcom 
would be given this role: it is by far and away the best placed to do so. 

Finally, in respect of these to whom provisions should apply, I would consider that the basic 
concept of ‘press like services’ as described above should be considered. In addition, I do 
think it makes sense to apply backstop regulation, if required, only to those organisations of 
a sufficient size, and with sufficient impact, to make accountability to society an important 
issue.  I  would  suggest  that  Ofcom  would  have  to  be  tasked  with  developing  appropriate 
metrics along the lines I have set out above.

self‑regulatory body

Introduction
Earlier  in  this  Part  of  the  Report,1  I  set  out  my  recommendations  for  independent  self-
regulation. In that Chapter, I make it clear that I do not consider that it is my role to set the 
standards that should be applied by an independent regulatory body, but that setting those 
standards should be the role of that body, in consultation with the industry and with the 
wider public.

However, within the evidence given during the course of this Inquiry, I have inevitably heard 
much which bears on what those standards are or should be and how they might be made 
more relevant and effective. In this Chapter, I have collected together some of the explicit 
recommendations that I have made and, in addition, some other ideas which I express in 
the form of a recommendation that the industry and any putative independent regulatory 
body should be prepared to consider. The use of this different language is very deliberate: 
by making a recommendation that consideration should be given to an issue, I am doing no 
more than seeking to assist by identifying to the industry features that it should be prepared 
to consider. In this regard, it is not my intention to direct.

On some of these additional issues, I have strong personal views, and on others less so. On 
all of them, I accept entirely that they are matters that should be properly considered by the 
industry in its own attempt to demonstrate to the public that it has taken both seriously and 
to heart the public concerns that have been expressed over the recent past and by the new 
regulatory body as part of a standards setting process.

This Chapter does not introduce any new ideas. All that appears has been derived from the 
evidence presented to the Inquiry and analysed in the Report. I do not therefore reproduce 
that evidence or any analysis here; references go back to the relevant Chapters of the Report 
and are mostly to be found in the earlier Chapters of Part F.

2.  recommendations to a new regulatory body

2.1 

Internal governance
The point has been made that the current practice has the effect of encouraging publishers 
to rely on the PCC to deal with complaints rather than putting in place processes to deal with 
them effectively in-house. I have already recommended that a new regulatory system should 
require from each subscribing member of the body:

(a) 

(b) 

an adequate in-house complaint process which should be exhausted before a complaint 
can be taken to the regulator; and
an annual return to be made to the regulator in relation to compliance so as to make 
transparent the extent to which complaints have been made and the way in which they 
have been handled.

1 Part K, Chapter 7

1795

KI also recommend that a new regulatory body should consider requiring:

(a) 

that newspapers should publish their annual compliance reports in their own 
pages to ensure that their readers have easy access to the information;2 and

(b)  as  proposed  by  lord  black,  that  a  named  senior  individual  within  each  title 

should have responsibility for compliance and standards.3

2.2 

Incentives to membership
I have recommended earlier in Part K some incentives to membership that would benefit 
those who joined a new regulaory body. A number of other incentives were suggested by 
other witnesses to the Inquiry. Of these:

I recommend that a new regulatory body should consider establishing a kitemark for 
use by members to establish a recognised brand of trusted journalism.4

2.3 

2.4 

The Code
There has been a lot of support for the current Editors’ Code. However, issues have also been 
identified with it. I have made the points that in order to provide an ethical framework for 
editors and journalists to work within, it needs to set the ethical and legal context in which 
it applies, and that it must do so in a clear and practical way. I would not want to lose any of 
the positive elements of the existing Code, but given those two broader points and the broad 
swathe of evidence that I heard:

I recommend that a regulatory body should consider engaging in an early thorough 
review of the Code with the aim of developing a clearer statement of the standards 
expected of editors and journalists.5 It is important that the public should be engaged 
in that review.

Powers and sanctions
The PCC does not consider complaints while any relevant legal action is pending. I remain to 
be convinced that there is any particularly unique problem associated with defamation that 
makes it impossible for court and regulatory action to be taken simultaneously. It seems, of 
course, reasonable that either the regulator or a court should be able to stay the regulatory 
action if proceeding in parallel would create a risk of injustice, but that is no reason for a 
blanket  ban  on  the  regulator  considering  regulatory  issues  without  waiting  for  any  legal 
action first to be completed: such an approach would be in line with the approach adopted 
in other cases of parallel civil and regulatory action. Lord Black agreed that a new regulator 
should, at least, be willing to allow a complaint to be heard prior to legal action.

I recommend that a regulator should take the view that a complainant can bring a 
complaint prior to taking legal action if that is the desired course of action. Challenges 
to that approach can be decided on the merits.6

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureK2.5 

The Inquiry heard a substantial amount of evidence relating to the allegedly discriminatory 
treatment of women and minorities in the press. I have already recommended that a new 
regulatory body must have the power to take complaints from third parties and representative 
groups. This may equip a regulator sufficiently to deal with this issue to the extent that they 
deem necessary. However:

2.6 

2.7 

2.8 

2.9 

I recommend that consideration should also be given to Code amendments which, 
while fully protecting freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, would equip 
that body with the power to intervene in cases of allegedly discriminatory reporting, 
and in so doing reflect the spirit of equalities legislation.7

I have reflected the arguments around whether the independent body should have the power 
to award compensation and conclude that there are real risks that doing so would make the 
system unwieldy and ineffective. In addition, the arbitral system that I have recommended 
would  provide  swift  financial  redress  in  relation  to  breaches  of  the  civil  law.  I  therefore 
recommend that a regulatory body should not seek the power to award compensation.8

I have already recommended that a regulatory body should have the power to levy fines in 
relation to serious or systemic breaches of standards. This raises the question of what should 
happen to any such payments. It would be inappropriate for the income from fines to be 
used to fund the day to day operation of the regulator because of the incentives that would 
create. The solution proposed by Lord Black is that any fines should be paid into a ringfenced 
enforcement fund that would finance subsequent investigations. I agree that this appears to 
be an acceptable way of dealing with the issue and:

I recommend that a new regulatory body should establish a ringfenced enforcement 
fund,  into  which  receipts  from  fines  could  be  paid,  for  the  purpose  of  funding 
investigations.9

Protecting the public
The PCC attracted plaudits for its services in relation to providing ‘desist’ notices in cases 
where individuals have made it known that they do not welcome press intrusion. This service 
is seen by many as valuable and can be particularly helpful to vulnerable people at a difficult 
time.

I recommend that a new regulatory body should continue to provide a service to warn 
the press, and other relevant parties such as broadcasters and press photographers, 
when an individual has made it clear that they do not welcome press intrusion.10

There have been concerns expressed about the behaviour of press photographers and the 
publication  of  photographs  taken  at  a  time,  or  in  a  way,  that  breaches  the  Editors’  Code. 
There  is  obviously  a  limit  to  the  extent  to  which  a  press  self-regulatory  body  can  impact 
on the behaviour of photographers from agencies or of freelance photographers. However, 
the  press  must  remain  responsible  for  the  content  it  publishes  regardless  of  its  source. 
It  is  important  therefore  that  publishers  should  ensure  that  they  only  use  information  or 
photographs provided by third parties that were obtained ethically.

9 Part K, Chapter 7, para 4.39
10 Part K, Chapter 7, para 4.35

1797

Chapter 9 | Recommendations for the self-regulatory bodyKI recommend that a new regulatory body should make it clear that newspapers will 
be held strictly accountable, under their standards code, for any material that they 
publish, including photographs (however sourced).11

The public interest

2.10  The way in which a regulatory body understands and applies the concept of the public interest 
will be of great importance both to the newspapers themselves, and to the public and those 
who are the subjects of journalism. There would be benefit from a greater measure of clarity 
over that interpretation.

I  therefore  recommend  that  a  regulatory  body  should  provide  guidance  on  the 
interpretation of the public interest that justifies what would otherwise constitute a 
breach of the Code. this must be framed in the context of the different provisions of 
the Code relating to the public interest, so as to make it easier to justify what might 
otherwise be considered as contrary to standards of propriety.12

2.11  The question also arises as to how judgments on the public interest are taken within editorial 
teams and how the proper thought process can be demonstrated to the regulator should 
the need arise. The obvious and simple solution to this is that the publisher should make 
a contemporaneous note of the issues raised and the consideration given to them. This is 
an issue that has already been to some extent addressed by the Code Committee, and the 
Editors’ Code now says:

“Whenever the public interest is invoked, the PCC will require editors to demonstrate 
fully that they reasonably believed that publication, or journalistic activity undertaken 
with a view to publication, would be in the public interest and how, and with whom, 
that was established at the time.”

2.12 

I recommend that:

a  new  regulatory  body  should  consider  being  explicit  that  where  a  public  interest 
justification  is  to  be  relied  upon  they  would  expect  to  see  a  record  of  the  factors 
weighing against and in favour of publication, along with a record of the reasons for 
the conclusion reached.13

2.13 

It has been suggested that some editors might find it helpful, in particularly difficult cases, to 
be able to seek advice prior to publication on issues surrounding the approach to a relevant 
public  interest  question.  I  recognise  that  any  requirement  to  seek  pre-publication  advice 
would be a constraint on freedom of speech and is simply not appropriate but, on the basis 
that the decision is always one for the editor, it seems to me that what is no more than the 
opportunity to seek such advice offends neither those rights nor editorial independence.

I therefore recommend that a new regulatory body should consider whether it might 
provide an advisory service to editors in relation to consideration of the public interest 
in taking particular actions.14

PART K | Regulatory Models for the FutureKAccess to information

2.14  The Inquiry heard evidence of how the interpretation of some stories based on reports by 
third parties can be confusing. Medical and scientific stories were a particular concern. To 
further  public  understanding,  I  recommend  that  a  new  regulatory  body  should  consider 
encouraging the press to be as transparent as possible in relation to the sources used for 
stories, including providing any information that would help readers to assess the reliability of 
information from a source and providing easy access, such as web links, to publicly available 
sources of information such as scientific studies or poll results. This should include putting 
the names of photographers alongside images. This is not in any way intended to undermine 
the  existing  provisions  on  protecting  journalists’  sources,  only  to  encourage  transparency 
where it is both possible and appropriate to do so.15

Protecting journalists

2.15  Lord Hunt the current Chair of the PCC, suggested that there should  be a whistleblowing 
hotline into a new regulatory structure for those who feel that they are being asked to do 
things which are contrary to the Code. It is a shame that this has not been taken on board by 
the industry proposal and

I recommend that a regulatory body should put such a mechanism in place.16

2.16  The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and many others argued that journalists who comply 
with the code deserve some protection for doing so. I was struck that Rupert Murdoch, when 
the  idea  of  employment  contracts  including  a  conscience  clause  was  put  to  him,  did  not 
disagree.

I recommend that the industry generally, and a regulatory body in particular, should 
consider  requiring  its  members  to  include  in  their  contracts  with  journalist  staff  a 
clause to prevent any disciplinary action being taken against a journalist as a result of 
his or her refusing to do something which is contrary to the code of practice.17

Regulatory Models for the Future
Establishing an independent self-regulatory regime

Independence: appointments

An  independent  self  regulatory  body  should  be  governed  by  an  independent  Board.  In 
order to ensure the independence of the body, the Chair and members of the Board must 
be appointed in a genuinely open, transparent and independent way, without any influence 
from industry or Government.1

The appointment of the Chair of the Board should be made by an appointment panel. The 
selection of that panel must itself be conducted in an appropriately independent way and 
must, itself, be independent of the industry and of Government.2

The appointment panel:

4. 

5. 

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

should be appointed in an independent, fair and open way;
should contain a substantial majority of members who are demonstrably independent 
of the press;
should  include  at  least  one  person  with  a  current  understanding  and  experience  of 
the press;
should include no more than one current editor of a publication that could be a member 
of the body.3

The appointment of the Board should also be an independent process, and the composition of 
the Board should include people with relevant expertise. The requirement for independence 
means that there should be no serving editors on the Board.4

The members of the Board should be appointed by the same appointment panel that appoints 
the Chair, together with the Chair (once appointed), and should:

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

be appointed by a fair and open process;
comprise a majority of people who are independent of the press;
include a sufficient number of people with experience of the industry who may include 
former editors and senior or academic journalists;

(d)  not include any serving editor; and
(e)  not  include  any  serving  member  of  the  House  of  Commons  or  any  member  of 

the Government.5

Independence: funding

Funding for the system should be settled in agreement between the industry and the Board, 
taking into account the cost of fulfilling the obligations of the regulator and the commercial 
pressures on the industry. There should be an indicative budget which the Board certifies is 
adequate for the purpose. Funding settlements should cover a four or five year period and 
should be negotiated well in advance.6

Functions
Standards Code and Governance Requirements
The  standards  code  must  ultimately  be  the  responsibility  of,  and  adopted  by,  the  Board, 
advised by a Code Committee which may comprise both independent members of the Board 
and serving editors.7

The code must take into account the importance of freedom of speech, the interests of the 
public  (including  the  public  interest  in  detecting  or  exposing  crime  or  serous  impropriety, 
protecting public health and safety and preventing the public from being seriously misled) 
and the rights of individuals. Specifically, it must cover standards of:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

conduct,  especially  in  relation  to  the  treatment  of  other  people  in  the  process  of 
obtaining material;
appropriate respect for privacy where there is no sufficient public interest justification 
for breach and
accuracy, and the need to avoid misrepresentation.8

The Board should require, of those who subscribe, appropriate internal governance processes, 
transparency on what governance processes they have in place, and notice of any failures in 
compliance, together with details of steps taken to deal with failures in compliance.9

Complaints
The Board should require all those who subscribe to have an adequate and speedy complaint 
handling mechanism; it should encourage those who wish to complain to do so through that 
mechanism and should not receive complaints directly unless or until the internal complaints 
system has been engaged without the complaint being resolved in an appropriate time.10

The Board should have the power to hear and decide on complaints about breach of the 
standards code by those who subscribe. The Board should have the power (but not necessarily 
in all cases depending on the circumstances the duty) to hear complaints whoever they come 
from,  whether  personally  and  directly  affected  by  the  alleged  breach,  or  a  representative 
group affected by the alleged breach, or a third party seeking to ensure accuracy of published 
information. In the case of third party complaints the views of the party most closely involved 
should be taken into account.11

Decisions  on  complaints  should  be  the  ultimate  responsibility  of  the  Board,  advised  by 
complaints handling officials to whom appropriate delegations may be made.12

Serving editors should not be members of any Committee advising the Board on complaints 
and any such Committee should have a composition broadly reflecting that of the main Board, 
with a majority of people who are independent of the press.13

Powers, Remedies and Sanctions
In relation to complaints, the Board should have the power to direct appropriate remedial 
action for breach of standards and the publication of corrections and apologies. Although 
remedies are essentially about correcting the record for individuals, the power to require a 
correction and an apology must apply equally in relation to individual standards breaches 
(which the Board has accepted) and to groups of people (or matters of fact) where there is no 
single identifiable individual who has been affected.15

The power to direct the nature, extent and placement of apologies should lie with the Board.16

The Board should not have the power to prevent publication of any material, by anyone, at 
any time although (in its discretion) it should be able to offer a service of advice to editors 
of subscribing publications relating to code compliance which editors, in their discretion, can 
deploy in civil proceedings arising out of publication.17

The  Board,  being  an  independent  self-regulatory  body,  should  have  authority  to  examine 
issues on its own initiative and have sufficient powers to carry out investigations both into 
suspected serious or systemic breaches of the code and failures to comply with directions of 
the Board. Those who subscribe must be required to cooperate with any such investigation.18

The  Board  should  have  the  power  to  impose  appropriate  and  proportionate  sanctions, 
(including  financial  sanctions  up  to  1%  of  turnover  with  a  maximum  of  £1m),  on  any 
subscriber found to be responsible for serious or systemic breaches of the standards code or 
governance requirements of the body. The sanctions that should be available should include 
power to require publication of corrections, if the breaches relate to accuracy, or apologies if 
the breaches relate to other provisions of the code.19

The Board should have both the power and a duty to ensure that all breaches of the standards 
code that it considers are recorded as such and that proper data is kept that records the 
extent to which complaints have been made and their outcome; this information should be 
made available to the public in a way that allows understanding of the compliance record of 
each title.20

 Summary of RecommendationsLReporting
The Board should publish an Annual Report identifying:

21. 

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 
(d) 

(e) 

the body’s subscribers, identifying any significant changes in subscriber numbers;
the number of complaints it has handled and the outcomes reached, both in aggregate 
for the all subscribers and individually in relation to each subscriber;
a summary of any investigations carried out and the result of them;
a report on the adequacy and effectiveness of compliance processes and procedures 
adopted by subscribers; and
information about the extent to which the arbitration service had been used.21

Arbitration Service
The Board should provide an arbitral process in relation to civil legal claims against subscribers, 
drawing on independent legal experts of high reputation and ability on a cost-only basis to 
the subscribing member. The process should be fair, quick and inexpensive, inquisitorial and 
free for complainants to use (save for a power to make an adverse order for the costs of the 
arbitrator if proceedings are frivolous or vexatious). The arbitrator must have the power to 
hold hearings where necessary but, equally, to dispense with them where it is not necessary. 
The process must have a system to allow frivolous or vexatious claims to be struck out at an 
early stage.22

Encouraging membership
A new system of regulation should not be considered sufficiently effective if it does not cover 
all significant news publishers.23

The membership of a regulatory body should be open to all publishers on fair, reasonable and 
non-discriminatory  terms,  including  making  membership  potentially  available  on  different 
terms for different types of publisher.24

In  any  reconsideration  of  the  powers  of  the  Information  Commissioner  (or  replacement 
body), power should be given to that body to determine that membership of a satisfactory 
regulatory body, which required appropriate governance and transparency standards from its 
members in relation to compliance with data protection legislation and good practice, should 
be taken into account when considering whether it is necessary or proportionate to take any 
steps in relation to a subscriber to that body.25

It  should  be  open  any  subscriber  to  a  recognised  regulatory  body  to  rely  on  the  fact  of 
such  membership  and  on  the  opportunity  it  provides  for  the  claimant  to  use  a  fair,  fast 
and inexpensive arbitration service. It could request the court to encourage the use of that 
system of arbitration and, equally, to have regard to the availability of the arbitration system 
when considering claims for costs incurred by a claimant who could have used the arbitration 
service. On the issue of costs, it should equally be open to a claimant to rely on failure by a 
newspaper to subscribe to the regulator thereby depriving him or her of access to a fair, fast

court could take the view that, even where the defendant is successful, absent unreasonable 
or vexatious conduct on the part of the claimant, it would be inappropriate for the claimant 
to be expected to pay the costs incurred in defending the action.26

Recognition
In order to meet the public concern that the organisation by the press of its regulation is by a 
body which is independent of the press, independent of Parliament and independent of the 
Government, that fulfils the legitimate requirements of such a body and can provide, by way 
of benefit to its subscribers, recognition of involvement in the maintenance of high standards 
of journalism, the law must identify those legitimate requirements and provide a mechanism 
to recognise and certify that a new body meets them.27

The responsibility for recognition and certification of a regulator shall rest with a recognition 
body.  In  its  capacity  as  the  recognition  body,  it  will  not  be  involved  in  regulation  of 
any subscriber.28

The  requirements  for  recognition  should  be  those  set  out  the  recommendations  set  out 
above numbered 1 to 24 inclusive and more fully described in Part K, Chapter 7, Section 4 of 
the Report.29

The operation of any certified body should be reviewed by the recognition body after two 
years and thereafter at three yearly intervals.30

The role of recognition body, that is to say, to recognise and certify that any particular body 
satisfies  (and,  on  review,  continues  to  satisfy)  the  requirements  set  out  in  law  should  fall 
on  Ofcom.  A  less  attractive  alternative  (on  the  basis  that  any  individual  will  not  have  the 
requisite  authority  or  experience  and  will  only  be  occasionally  be  required  to  fulfil  these 
functions) is for the appointment of an independent Recognition Commissioner supported 
by officials at Ofcom.31

It should be possible for the recognition body to recognise more than one regulatory body, 
should more than one seek recognition and meet the criteria, although this is not an outcome 
to be advocated and, should it be necessary for that step to be taken, would represent a 
failure on the part of the industry.32

In passing legislation to identify the legitimate requirements to be met by an independent 
regulator organised by the press, and to provide for a process of recognition and review of 
whether those requirements are and continue to be met, the law should also place an explicit 
duty on the Government to uphold and protect the freedom of the press.33

 Summary of RecommendationsL	

Recommendations	for	a	self-regulatory	body

Internal Governance

34. 

In addition to Recommendation 10 above, a new regulatory body should consider requiring:

(a) 

(b) 

that newspapers publish compliance reports in their own pages to ensure that their 
readers have easy access to the information;34 and
as proposed by Lord Black, that a named senior individual within each title should have 
responsibility for compliance and standards.35

Incentives to membership

35. 

A  new  regulatory  body  should  consider  establishing  a  kite  mark  for  use  by  members  to 
establish a recognised brand of trusted journalism.36

The Code

36. 

A  regulatory  body  should  consider  engaging  in  an  early  thorough  review  of  the  Code  (on 
which  the  public  should  be  engaged  and  consulted)  with  the  aim  of  developing  a  clearer 
statement of the standards expected of editors and journalists.37

Powers and sanctions

37. 

38. 

A regulatory body should be prepared to allow a complaint to be brought prior to commencing 
legal proceedings if so advised. Challenges to that approach (and applications to stay) can be 
decided on the merits.38

In conjunction with Recommendation 11 above, consideration should also be given to Code 
amendments which, while fully protecting freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, 
would  equip  that  body  with  the  power  to  intervene  in  cases  of  allegedly  discriminatory 
reporting, and in so doing reflect the spirit of equalities legislation.39

39. 

A new regulatory body should establish a ring-fenced enforcement fund, into which receipts 
from fines could be paid, for the purpose of funding investigations.40

Protecting the public

40. 

A new regulatory body should continue to provide advice to the public in relation to issues 
concerning the press and the Code along with a service to warn the press, and other relevant 
parties such as broadcasters and press photographers, when an individual has made it clear 
that they do not welcome press intrusion.41

1808

PART L | Summary of RecommendationsL41. 

A new regulatory body should make it clear that newspapers will be held strictly accountable, 
under  their  standards  code,  for  any  material  that  they  publish,  including  photographs 
(however sourced).42

The public interest

42. 

43. 

A regulatory body should provide guidance on the interpretation of the public interest that 
justifies what would otherwise constitute a breach of the Code. This must be framed in the 
context of the different provisions of the Code relating to the public interest, so as to make it 
easier to justify what might otherwise be considered as contrary to standards of propriety.43

A new regulatory body should consider being explicit that where a public interest justification 
is to be relied upon, a record should be available of the factors weighing against and in favour 
of publication, along with a record of the reasons for the conclusion reached.44

44. 

A  new  regulatory  body  should  consider  whether  it  might  provide  an  advisory  service  to 
editors in relation to consideration of the public interest in taking particular actions.45

45. 

46. 

47. 

Access to information

A new regulatory body should consider encouraging the press to be as transparent as possible 
in relation to the sources used for stories, including providing any information that would 
help readers to assess the reliability of information from a source and providing easy access, 
such as web links, to publicly available sources of information such as scientific studies or poll 
results. This should include putting the names of photographers alongside images. This is not 
in any way intended to undermine the existing provisions on protecting journalists’ sources, 
only to encourage transparency where it is both possible and appropriate to do so.46

Protecting journalists

A regulatory body should establish a whistleblowing hotline for those who feel that they are 
being asked to do things which are contrary to the code.47

The  industry  generally  and  a  regulatory  body  in  particular  should  consider  requiring  its 
members to include in the employment or service contracts with journalists a clause to the 
effect that no disciplinary action would be taken against a journalist as a result of a refusal to 
act in a manner which is contrary to the code of practice.48

 Summary of RecommendationsL	

The	Press	and	Data	Protection

Recommendations to the Ministry of Justice
The exemption in section 32 of the Data Protection Act 1998 should be amended so as to 
make it available only where:49

48. 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

the  processing  of  data  is  necessary  for  publication,  rather  than  simply  being  in  fact 
undertaken with a view to publication;
the  data  controller  reasonably  believes  that  the  relevant  publication  would  be  or  is 
in  the  public  interest,  with  no  special  weighting  of  the  balance  between  the  public 
interest in freedom of expression and in privacy; and
objectively, that the likely interference with privacy resulting from the processing of the 
data is outweighed by the public interest in publication.

49. 

The exemption in section 32 of the Data Protection Act 1998 should be narrowed in scope, so 
that it no longer allows, by itself, for exemption from:50

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 
(d) 

(e) 
(f) 

the requirement of the first data protection principle to process personal data fairly 
(except in relation to the provision of information to the data subject under paragraph 
2(1)(a) of Part II Schedule 1 to the 1998 Act) and in accordance with statute law;
the  second  data  protection  principle  (personal  data  to  be  obtained  only  for  specific 
purposes and not processed incompatibly with those purposes);
the fourth data protection principle (personal data to be accurate and kept up to date);
the sixth data protection principle (personal data to be processed in accordance with 
the rights of individuals under the Act);
the eighth data protection principle (restrictions on exporting personal data); and
the right of subject access.

The recommendation on the removal of the right of subject access from the scope of section 
32 is subject to any necessary clarification that the law relating to the protection of journalists’ 
sources is not affected by the Act.

50. 

It should be made clear that the right to compensation for distress conferred by section 13 of 
the Data Protection Act 1998 is not restricted to cases of pecuniary loss, but should include 
compensation for pure distress.51

51. 

The  procedural  provisions  of  the  Data  Protection  Act  1998  with  special  application  to 
journalism in:

(a) 
(b) 

section 32(4) and (5)
sections 44 to 46 inclusive

should be repealed.52

55.

58. 

59. 

In conjunction with the repeal of those procedural provisions, consideration should be given 
to the desirability of including in the Data Protection Act 1998 a provision to the effect that, 
in considering the exercise of any powers in relation to the media or other publishers, the 
Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  have  special  regard  to  the  obligation  in  law  to 
balance the public interest in freedom of expression alongside the public interest in upholding 
the data protection regime.53

Specific provision should be made to the effect that, in considering the exercise of any of its 
powers in relation to the media or other publishers, the Information Commissioner’s Office 
must have regard to the application to a data controller of any relevant system of regulation 
or standards enforcement which is contained in or recognised by statute.54

The necessary steps should be taken to bring into force the amendments made to section 
55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 by section 77 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 
2008 (increase of sentence maxima) to the extent of the maximum specified period; and by 
section 78 of the 2008 Act (enhanced defence for public interest journalism).55

The prosecution powers of the Information Commissioner should be extended to include any 
offence which also constitutes a breach of the data protection principles.56

A  new  duty  should  be  introduced  (whether  formal  or  informal)  for  the  Information 
Commissioner’s  Office  to  consult  with  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  in  relation  to  the 
exercise of its powers to undertake criminal proceedings.57

The opportunity should be taken to consider amending the Data Protection Act 1998 formally 
to reconstitute the Information Commissioner’s Office as an Information Commission, led by 
a Board of Commissioners with suitable expertise drawn from the worlds of regulation, public 
administration, law and business, and active consideration should be given in that context to 
the desirability of including on the Board a Commissioner from the media sector.58

Recommendations to the Information Commissioner
The Information Commissioner’s Office should take immediate steps to prepare, adopt and 
publish a policy on the exercise of its formal regulatory functions in order to ensure that the 
press complies with the legal requirements of the data protection regime.59

In discharge of its functions and duties to promote good practice in areas of public concern, 
the  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  take  immediate  steps,  in  consultation  with 
the  industry,  to  prepare  and  issue  comprehensive  good  practice  guidelines  and  advice 
on appropriate principles and standards to be observed by the press in the processing of 
personal data. This should be prepared and implemented within six months from the date of 
this Report.60

66. 

	

67. 

The Information Commissioner’s Office should take steps to prepare and issue guidance to 
the public on their individual rights in relation to the obtaining and use by the press of their 
personal data, and how to exercise those rights.61

In particular, the Information Commissioner’s Office should take immediate steps to publish 
advice aimed at individuals (data subjects) concerned that their data have or may have been 
processed by the press unlawfully or otherwise than in accordance with good practice.62

The  Information  Commissioner’s  Office,  in  the  Annual  Report  to  Parliament  which  it  is 
required to make by virtue of section 52(1) of the Act, should include regular updates on the 
effectiveness of the foregoing measures, and on the culture, practices and ethics of the press 
in relation to the processing of personal data.63

The  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  immediately  adopt  the  Guidelines  for 
Prosecutors  on  assessing  the  public  interest  in  cases  affecting  the  media,  issued  by  the 
Director of Public Prosecutions in September 2012.64

The  Information  Commissioner’s  Office  should  take  immediate  steps  to  engage  with  the 
Metropolitan Police on the preparation of a long-term strategy in relation to alleged media 
crime with a view to ensuring that the Office is well placed to fulfil any necessary role in 
this respect in the future, and in particular in the aftermath of Operations Weeting, Tuleta 
and Elveden.65

The Information Commissioner’s Office should take the opportunity to review the availability 
to  it  of  specialist  legal  and  practical  knowledge  of  the  application  of  the  data  protection 
regime to the press, and to any extent necessary address it.66

The Information Commissioner’s Office should take the opportunity to review its organisation 
and  decision-making  processes  to  ensure  that  large-scale  issues,  with  both  strategic  and 
operational dimensions (including the relationship between the culture, practices and ethics 
of  the  press  in  relation  to  personal  information  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  application  of 
the data protection regime to the press on the other) can be satisfactorily considered and 
addressed in the round.67

Regulation	by	Law
The Criminal Law
On the basis that the provisions of s77-78 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 
are brought into effect, so that increased sentencing powers are available for breaches of 
s55 of the Data Protection Act 1998,68 the Secretary of State for Justice should use the power 
vested in him by s124(1)(a)(i) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to invite the Sentencing 
Council of England and Wales to prepare guidelines in relation to data protection offences 
(including computer misuse).69

PART L | Summary of RecommendationsL68. 

The Home Office should consider and, if necessary, consult upon:70

(a)  whether paragraph 2(b) of Schedule 1 to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 

(PACE) should be repealed;

(b)  whether  PACE  should  be  amended  to  provide  a  definition  of  the  phrase  “for  the 

purposes of journalism” in s13(2); and

(c)  whether s11(3) of PACE should be amended by providing that journalistic material is 
only held in confidence for the PACE provisions if it is held or has continuously been held 
since it was first acquired or created subject to an enforceable or lawful undertaking, 
restriction or obligation.

The Civil Law

Damages

69. 

70. 

There  should  be  a  review  of  damages  generally  available  for  breach  of  data  protection, 
privacy,  breach  of  confidence  or  any  other  media-related  torts,  to  ensure  proportionate 
compensation  including  for  non-pecuniary  loss  (all  referable  to  the  duration,  extent  and 
gravity of the contravention).71

The  Civil  Justice  Council  should  consider  the  level  of  damages  in  privacy,  breach  of 
confidence and data protection cases, being prepared to take evidence (from the Information 
Commissioner,  the  media  and  others)  and  thereafter  to  make  recommendations  on  the 
appropriate level of damages for distress in such cases. How the matter is then taken forward 
will ultimately be for the courts to consider.72

71. 

The Report of the Law Commission on Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages 
should be adopted in relation to its recommendations that legislation should provide that:

(a) 

(b) 

aggravated damages should only be awarded to compensate for mental distress and 
should have no punitive element;
exemplary damages should be retained (although re-titled as punitive damages).73

72. 

Exemplary  damages  (whether  so  described  or  renamed  as  punitive  damages)  should  be 
available  for  actions  for  breach  of  privacy,  breach  of  confidence  and  similar  media  torts, 
as  well  as  for  libel  and  slander.  The  application  to  a  defendant  of  any  relevant  system  of 
regulation of standards enforcement which is contained in or recognised by statute and good 
internal governance in relation to the sourcing of stories should be relevant to the decisions 
reached in relation to such damages.74

Costs

73. 

The Civil Procedure Rules should be amended to require the court, when considering the 
appropriate  order  for  costs  at  the  conclusion  of  proceedings,  to  take  into  account  the 
availability of an arbitral system set up by an independent regulator itself recognised by law. 
The purpose of this recommendation is to provide an important incentive for every publisher

75. 

76. 

to join the new system and encourage those who complain that their rights have been infringed 
to use it as a speedy, effective and comparatively inexpensive method of resolving disputes.75

In the absence of the provision of an approved mechanism for dispute resolution, available 
through  an  independent  regulator  without  cost  to  the  complainant,  together  with  an 
adjustment to the Civil Procedure Rules to require or permit the court take account of the 
availability of cost free arbitration as an alternative to court proceedings, qualified one way 
costs shifting should be introduced for defamation, privacy, breach of confidence and similar 
media related litigation as proposed by Lord Justice Jackson.76

The Press and the Police
Off-the-record briefings
The term ‘off-the-record briefing’ should be discontinued. The term ‘non-reportable briefing’ 
should be used to cover a background briefing which is not to be reported, and the term 
‘embargoed briefing’ should be used to cover a situation where the content of the briefing 
may be reported but not until a specified event or time. These terms more neutrally describe 
what are legitimate police and media interactions.77

It should be mandatory for ACPO rank officers to record all of their contact with the media, 
and for that record to be available publicly for transparency and audit purposes. This record 
need be no more than a very brief note to the effect that a conversation has taken place and 
the subject matter of that conversation. Where the discussion  involves a more significant 
operational  or  organisational  matter,  then  it  may  be  sensible  for  a  more  detailed  note  to 
be retained. Finally, in circumstances where policy or organisation matters may be on the 
agenda for discussion, it is good practice for a press officer also to be present.78

77. 

The simple rule included within the ‘Interim ACPO Guidance for Relationships with the Media’ 
should be adopted as good practice.79 This is:

“Police officers and staff should ask: ‘am I the person responsible for communicating 
about this issue and is there a policing purpose for doing so?’ If the answer to both 
parts of this question is ‘yes’, they should go ahead.”

78. 

Leaks of information
The Police Service should re-examine the rigour of the auditing process and the frequency of 
the conduct of audits in relation to access to the Police National Computer (PNC). Additional 
consideration should also be given to the number of people given access to the PNC and the 
associated rules which govern its usage.80

PART L | Summary of RecommendationsL79. 

80. 

81. 

Gifts, hospitality and entertainment
The  recent  ACPO  Guidance  should  more  specifically  spell  out  the  dangers  of  consuming 
alcohol in a setting of casual hospitality (without necessarily specifying a blanket ban).81

Media employment
Consideration should be given to the terms upon which ACPO rank officers are appointed 
and, in particular, whether these terms should include some limitation upon the nature of 
any employment within or by the media that can be undertaken without the approval of the 
relevant authority for a period of 12 months following the cessation of the appointment.82

Corruption, whistleblowing and related matters
An enhanced system for protection of whistleblowers and for providing assistance for the 
Police Service on general ethical issues should at least comprise the following:83

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

greater  prominence  should  be  given  to  the  Public  Interest  Disclosure  Act  (PIDA) 
telephone line operated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC);
there  should  be  an  ‘ethics  line’  to  the  IPCC,  available  for  all  serving  Police  Officers, 
providing general ethical guidance;
to  avail  those  at  rank  of  Chief  Constable  (Assistant  Commissioner  level  within  the 
Metropolitan  Police  Service),  Her  Majesty’s  Inspectorate  of  Constabulary  should 
identify  one  of  its  members,  a  former  Chief  Constable,  as  the  designated  point  of 
contact for confidential ethics guidance. The Chief Officer seeking and obtaining that 
advice would be able to refer to it should any issue subsequently arise on a complaint 
to a Professional Standards Department, a Police and Crime Commissioner, or indeed 
the IPCC itself. The advice would not be determinative of the complaint, but the fact 
that it was sought and received, as well as its content, would be a matter to be taken 
into account;

(e) 

(d)  within the IPCC itself, there is a need for an enhanced ‘filter system’ whereby the nature 
of  complaints  are  appropriately  addressed  at  an  early  stage  so  that  (a)  they  can  be 
investigated at the right level, and (b) sufficient structures are put in place to maintain 
confidentiality of the complaint, and differentiate as soon as is appropriate between 
genuine whistleblowers and those who are merely ventilating a personal grievance;
the former Chief Constable referred to under sub-paragraph (c) above should also be 
the recipient of complaints about Chief Constables made to the IPCC. In the event that 
he or she may already have given informal advice in relation to the subject-matter of 
the complaint, as per sub-paragraph (c) above, a substitute HMI would be deputed to 
act; and
Chief  Officers  should  also  be  the  subject  of  regular  independent  scrutiny  by  HMIC, 
including through unannounced inspections.

 Summary of RecommendationsL	
82. 

The	Press	and	Politicians
As a first step, political leaders should reflect constructively on the merits of publishing on 
behalf of their party a statement setting out, for the public, an explanation of the approach 
they propose to take as a matter of party policy in conducting relationships with the press.84

83. 

Party Leaders, Ministers and Front Bench Opposition spokesmen should consider publishing:85

(a) 

the simple fact of long term relationships with media proprietors, newspaper editors or 
senior executives which might be thought to be relevant to their responsibilities and,

(b)  on a quarterly basis:

i. 

ii. 

details  of  all  meetings  with  media  proprietors,  newspaper  editors  or  senior 
executives, whether in person or through agents on either side, and the fact and 
general nature of any discussion of media policy issues at those meetings; and
a fair and reasonably complete picture, by way of general estimate only, of the 
frequency or density of other interaction (including correspondence, phone, text 
and email) but not necessarily including content.

84. 

	
85. 

86. 

87. 

88. 

89. 

The suggestions that I have made in the direction of greater transparency about meetings 
and contacts should be considered not just as a future project but as an immediate need, not 
least in relation to interactions relevant to any consideration of this Report.86

Plurality	and	Media	Ownership
The particular public policy goals of ensuring that citizens are informed and preventing too 
much influence in any one pair of hands over the political process are most directly served by 
concentrating on plurality in news and current affairs. This focus should be kept under review.87

Online publication should be included in any market assessment for consideration of plurality.88

Ofcom and the Government should work, with the industry, on the measurement framework, 
in order to achieve as great a measure of consensus as is possible on the theory of how media 
plurality should be measured before the measuring system is deployed, with all the likely 
commercial tensions that will emerge.89

The levels of influence that would give rise to concerns in relation to plurality must be lower, 
and  probably  considerably  lower,  than  the  levels  of  concentration  that  would  give  rise  to 
competition concerns.90

Ofcom has presented the Inquiry and the Government with a full menu of potential remedies, 
and it has not been argued or suggested that any of them are inappropriate in principle. Each 
of them might be appropriate in a given set of circumstances and the relevant regulatory 
authority should have all of them in its armoury.91

PART L | Summary of RecommendationsL90. 

91. 

92. 

The Government should consider whether periodic plurality reviews or an extension to the 
public interest test within the markets regime in competition law is most likely to provide a 
timely warning of, and response to, plurality concerns that develop as the result of organic 
growth, recognising that the proposal for a regular plurality review is more closely focussed 
on plurality issues.92

Before making a decision to refer a media merger to the competition authorities on public 
interest grounds, the Secretary of State should consult relevant parties as to the arguments 
for and against a referral, and should be required to make public his reasons for reaching a 
decision one way or the other.93

The  Secretary  of  State  should  remain  responsible  for  public  interest  decisions  in  relation 
to  media  mergers.  The  Secretary  of  State  should  be  required  either  to  accept  the  advice 
provided by the independent regulators, or to explain why that advice has been rejected. 
At the same time, whichever way the Secretary of State decides the matter, the nature and 
extent of any submissions or lobbying to which the Secretary of State and his officials and 
advisors had been subject should be recorded and published.94

1.  Overview
1.1 

This Annex sets out an overview of the law of particular relevance to the Inquiry’s terms of 
reference. The purpose of the Annex is to summarise the current law to the extent that this 
is necessary to understand the evidence heard by the Inquiry, to put that evidence in a legal 
context and to assist in understanding the legal framework within which the recommendations 
set out in the Report are framed. The Annex is not intended to be a complete or definitive 
recitation of the law relating to the press, nor does the commentary in the Annex seek to 
determine any points of law or carry any weight in any future legal proceedings. For those 
unfamiliar  with  the  law,  in  the  interests  of  clarity,  authorities  which  support  different 
propositions are repeated and explained in different parts of the text.

1.2 

The broad structure of the Annex is as follows:
•  Freedom of Speech and Article 10 – The importance of freedom of speech, Article 10 of 
the European Convention, section 12 of the Human Rights Act and the protection of jour-
nalists’ sources;

•  Civil Law – Breach of confidence, misuse of private information, protection from Harass-

ment Act 1997 and defamation;

•  Regulatory Law – Legal framework relating to the Information Commissioner;
•  Criminal Law – Substantive law restraining the conduct of journalists and the content of 

publications;

•  Criminal Procedure – Police powers of investigation in relation to journalists.

2.  freedom of speech and Article 10

2.1 

2.2 

Recognition of the right to freedom of expression
The concept of freedom of speech has a long history, although the establishment of a legally 
enforceable right to free speech in the United Kingdom is a relatively recent development in 
the law.

Freedom of speech in a specific context was recognised in the Bill of Rights 1689 which referred 
to “freedom of speech in Parliament”. Freedom of speech in broader terms was recognised 
in a number of international instruments in the twentieth century. At the first meeting of 
the General Assembly of the United Nations in London in 1946, freedom of expression was 
proclaimed as the touchstone of all human rights.1 Article 19 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 
1948 states that:

1 UN General Assembly Resolution 59(1) of 14 December 1946

1843

“Everyone  has  the  right  to  freedom  of  opinion  and  expression;  this  right  includes 
freedom  to  hold  opinions  without  interference  and  to  seek,  receive  and  impart 
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

2.3 

2.4 

2.5 

2.6 

The right to freedom of expression is also recognised in the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), which came into force in 1976.2 Article 19 of the ICCPR states 
that everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom 
to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either 
orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. It is 
also observed that the exercise of the right to freedom to seek, receive and impart information 
carries with it special duties and responsibilities and may be subject to restrictions where 
these are provided by law and are necessary to respect the rights and reputation of others or 
the protection of national security, public order or public health or morals.

The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
(Cm.  8969),  frequently  referred  to  as  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights  (The 
Convention)  was  signed  on  4  November  1950.  Freedom  of  expression  was  enshrined  in 
Article 10. Prior to the Convention being incorporated into domestic law through the Human 
Rights Act 1998, the domestic courts had regard to the jurisprudence of the European Court 
of Human Rights (ECtHR) on freedom of expression and common law had recognised that 
freedom of expression had achieved the status as a constitutional right.3 Today, Article 10 
of the Convention is incorporated into domestic law through the mechanism set out in the 
Human Rights Act 1998.

Freedom of expression has been recognised as one of the general rights protected under EU 
law.4 The right to free expression also forms part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
European Union in Article 11.5

The  importance  of  freedom  of  expression  is  well  established  by  both  the  ECtHR  and  the 
domestic courts.6 In R (Animal Defenders International) v Secretary of State for Culture, Media 
and Sport, Lord Bingham observed:7

“Freedom  of  thought  and  expression  is  an  essential  condition  of  an  intellectually 
healthy  society.  The  free  communication  of  information,  opinions  and  argument 
about the laws which a state should enact and the policies its government at all levels 
should pursue is an essential condition of truly democratic government. These are the 
values which article 10 exists to protect, and their importance gives it a central role 
in the Convention regime, protecting free speech in general and free political speech 
in particular.”

2 Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by UN General Assembly resolution 2200A (XXI) of 16 
December 1966, entry into force 23 March 1976
3 In McCartan Turkington Breen v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 1 AC 277, Lord Steyn noted that even before the 
coming into force of the HRA 1988, “the principle of freedom of expression [had] attained the status of a constitutional 
right with high attendant normative force”, with reference made to Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127 
at 207G-H
4 Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. See also C-353/89 EC Commission v 
Netherlands [1991] ECR I-40689 at para 30
5 Signed and proclaimed by the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the 
European Council meeting in Nice on 7 December 2000

APPENDICES2.7 

The link between individual freedom of expression and a free media may also be discerned in 
citations from authority at the highest level. For example, per Sir John Donaldson MR in A-G 
v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No.2):8

“… the existence of a free press … is an essential element in maintaining parliamentary 
democracy and the British way of life as we know it. But it is important to remember 
why the press occupies this crucial position. It is not because of any special wisdom, 
interest or status enjoyed by proprietors, editors or journalist. It is because the media 
are the eyes and ears of the general public. They act on behalf of the general public. 
Their right to know and their right to publish is neither more nor less than that of the 
general public.”

2.8 

Additionally,  Lord  Bingham  observed  in  the  case  of  R  (Laporte)  v  Chief  Constable  of 
Gloucestershire, that:9

“…  the  proper  functioning  of  a  modern  participatory  democracy  requires  that  the 
media be free, active, professional and inquiring. For this reason the courts, here and 
elsewhere, have recognised the cardinal importance of press freedom and the need 
for any restriction on that freedom to be proportionate and no more than necessary 
to promote the legitimate object of the restriction.”

2.9 

Further, the rationale for protecting the freedom of the press in contributing to debate in a 
democratic society has also been recognised. Lord Steyn observed in R v Secretary of State for 
the Home Department, Ex p Simms:10

“Freedom of expression is, of course, intrinsically important: it is valued for its own 
sake.  But  it  is  well  recognised  that  it  is  also  instrumentally  important.  It  serves  a 
number  of  broad  objectives.  First,  it  promotes  the  self-fulfilment  of  individuals  in 
society. Secondly, in the famous words of Holmes J (echoing John Stuart Mill), ‘the best 
test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the 
market’: Abrams v United States (1919) 250 US 616, 630, per Holmes J (dissenting). 
Thirdly, freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy. The free flow of information 
and  ideas  informs  political  debate.  It  is  a  safety  valve:  people  are  more  ready  to 
accept decisions that go against them if they can in principle seek to influence them. 
It acts as a brake on the abuse of power by public officials. It facilitates the exposure 
of errors in the governance and administration of justice of the country.”

Article 10 of the Convention
2.10  Article 10 of the Convention provides:

“1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom 
to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference 
by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States 
from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.
2.  The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, 
may  be  subject  to  such  formalities,  conditions,  restrictions  or  penalties  as  are 
prescribed  by  law  and  are  necessary  in  a  democratic  society,  in  the  interests  of

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsnational security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or 
crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or 
rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, 
or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”

2.11  Article 10(1) encompasses a number of freedoms, including freedom of expression, the right 
to hold and impart opinions and ideas and the right to receive information and ideas. The 
freedom to receive and the freedom to impart information are two independent rights and 
not merely corollaries of each other.11 These rights belong to everyone in society and are 
not  simply  rights  of  the  press,  although  freedom  of  the  press  and  other  news  media  has 
consistently been recognised in case law as protected by Article 10. Freedom of expression 
is not limited to written or spoken word but extends to print, radio, television broadcasting, 
film and artistic works. The European Court of Human Rights has recently confirmed that it 
is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on political issues and on other 
subjects of public interest, emphasising that not only does the press have the task of imparting 
such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.12

2.12  Article  10  protects  not  only  the  substance  of  ideas  and  information,  but  also  the  form  in 
which they are conveyed.13 Unlike the press, the broadcast media are subject, by the express 
terms of Article 10(1), to licensing provisions. The ECtHR has recognised in the context of 
audiovisual media the importance of pluralism as an aspect of Article 10, noting that “there 
can be no democracy without pluralism. Democracy thrives on freedom of expression.”14

2.13  The State has not only a negative obligation to ensure that these rights are not infringed 
unless an infringement is necessary in a democratic society, but in some circumstances may 
have a positive obligation to ensure that the rights contained in Article 10 are safeguarded.15 
In deciding whether a positive obligation to safeguard Article 10 exists, regard must be had 
to the kind of expression rights at stake; their capability to contribute to public debate; the 
nature and scope of restrictions on expression rights; the ability of alternative venues for 
expression; and the weight of countervailing rights of others or the public.16

2.14  The language of Article 10 recognises that freedom of expression carries with it duties and 
responsibilities. Some forms of speech have been denied protection under the Convention; 
for example racist literature and expressions of political support for terrorism.17 The ECtHR in 
Otto Preminger Institut emphasised the duty on those who exercise freedom of expression 
to avoid expression which does not contribute to public debate and is gratuitously offensive 
to others.18

16 For example the ECtHR has arguably conceded that a positive obligation arises for the State to protect the right to 
freedom of expression by ensuring a reasonable opportunity to exercise a right of reply and an opportunity to contest 
a newspaper’s refusal suing for a right to reply in courts (see Melnychuk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 28743/03, ECHR 2005-IX). 
The Court has stressed that States are required to create a favourable environment for participation in public debate 
by all the persons concerned, enabling them to express their opinions and ideas without fear (Dink v. Turkey, para 137)

APPENDICES2.15  Article  10  expressly  acknowledges  that  freedom  of  expression  may  be  overridden  where 
necessary  to  protect  legitimate  interests.  Any  restriction  on  free  speech  must  pass  three 
distinct tests: (a) the restriction must be prescribed by law, (b) the restriction must further a 
legitimate aim, and (c) the interference must be shown to be necessary and proportionate in 
a democratic society.19 Lord Steyn explained this approach in Reynolds v Times Newspapers: 20

“The  starting  point  is  now  the  right  of  freedom  of  expression,  a  right  based  on  a 
constitutional or higher legal order foundation. Exceptions to freedom of expression 
must  be  justified  as  being  necessary  in  a  democracy.  In  other  words,  freedom 
of  expression  is  the  rule  and  the  regulation  of  speech  is  the  exception  requiring 
justification.  The  existence  and  width  of  any  exception  can  only  be  justified  if  it  is 
underpinned by a pressing social need. These are fundamental principles governing 
the balance to be struck between freedom of expression and defamation.”

2.16  Legitimate grounds for interfering with freedom of expression are set out in Article 10(2). 
The court will require evidence to justify any interference with freedom of expression and 
not  simply  mere  assertion.21  The  ECtHR  has  emphasised  that  there  is  little  scope  under 
Article 10(2) of the Convention for restrictions on the press in relation to political speech or 
in relation to debate on matters of public interest and the court will require the strongest 
reasons to justify impediments to the exercise of such speech.22 However, in the context of 
other restrictions imposed by Article 10(2), for example the protection of health or morals, 
cases  have  recognised  that  states  enjoy  a  wide  margin  of  appreciation  as  to  appropriate 
restrictions on freedom of expression.

2.17  The legitimate aim of “protection of the reputation and rights of others” set out in Article 10(2) 
permits a wide range of interests to be invoked as a justification for imposing restrictions on 
freedom  of  expression.  The  interests  most  commonly  invoked  are  the  right  to  reputation 
and  the  protection  of  privacy  (which  is  often  referred  to  as  the  tort  of  misuse  of  private 
information in domestic law).23 However, the rights and interests of others which may justify 
restrictions on the freedom of speech are broader than reputation. For example, courts have 
recognised the need to protect the religious rights of others by restricting offensive material, 
to protect intellectual property rights, to protect a defendant’s right to a fair trial, and to 
protect confidential information held subject to a duty of confidence.24

and government must display restraint in resorting to criminal proceeding in this context. In particular, see a number of 
cases arising out of criminal proceedings taken against the owner of a newspaper for publishing press articles, readers’ 
letters and reports concerning the conflict between Turkish Government and Kurdish organisations where the ECtHR 
emphasised that there is little scope under Art 10(2) of the Convention for restrictions on the press in relation to political 
speech and debate: Application 23556/94, Ceylan v Turkey (2000) 30 EHRR 73, Application 23144/93, Ozgur Gundem v

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials2.18  Cases have drawn a distinction between reporting facts capable of contributing to a debate 
of general public interest in a democratic society, and making tawdry allegations about an 
individual’s  private  life.25  In  respect  of  the  former,  the  pre-eminent  role  of  the  press  in  a 
democracy and its duty to act as a “public watchdog” are important considerations in favour 
of  a  narrow  construction  of  any  limitations  on  freedom  of  expression.  However,  different 
considerations apply to press reports concentrating on sensational and lurid news, intended 
to titillate and entertain, which are aimed at satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership 
regarding aspects of a person’s strictly private life.26 Such reporting does not attract the robust 
protection of Article 10 afforded to the press. As a consequence, in such cases, freedom of 
expression requires a more narrow interpretation.27

Relevance of responsible journalism and ethical journalism in the 
context of Article 10

2.19  The  ECtHR  has  repeatedly  held  that  it  is  not  for  the  courts  to  substitute  their  own  views 
for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists.28 
However, the ECtHR has on number of occasions recognised that responsible journalism and 
compliance with the ethics of journalists will be a factor, and in some cases, a highly significant 
factor,  in  determining  whether  an  interference  with  the  right  to  freedom  of  expression  is 
justified and proportionate.

2.20  The ECtHR held in Flux (No 6) v Moldova that:29

“… under the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 10, the exercise of freedom of expression 
carries with it “duties and responsibilities” which also apply to the press… the Court 
will examine whether the journalist who wrote the impugned article acted in good 
faith and in accordance with the ethics of the profession of journalist”.

2.21  The ECtHR has also held that:30

“… the safeguard afforded by article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues 
of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith and on an 
accurate factual basis and provide “reliable and precise” information in accordance 
with the ethics of journalism.”

2.22  The conduct of a journalist cuts two ways. If a journalist has acted responsibly, in good faith, 
and in accordance with the ethics of journalism, these factors are likely to support an argument 
that freedom of expression should prevail over competing interests. There are a number of 
cases in which the ECtHR has referred to the fact a journalist has acted in conformity with 
professional ethics as part of the consideration whether there is a legitimate and proportionate 
interference with Article 10.31 On the other hand, in cases where journalists have not acted

APPENDICESwith  responsibility  or  have  disregarded  the  ethics  of  the  profession,  this  will  support  an 
argument that the interference with the freedom of expression is justified. For example, the 
case of Prager and Obserschlick v Austria concerned a journalist who had accused a judge 
of being biased and of having an arrogant and bullying attitude in the performance of his 
duties. The Court addressed the behaviour of the journalist and took the view that he could 
not invoke either good faith or compliance with the ethics of journalism, on the basis that 
the research that he had undertaken did not appear adequate to substantiate such serious 
allegations, the court noting that:32

“… [he] had not attended a single trial before Judge J.. he had not given the judge any 
opportunity to comment on the accusations levelled against him”.

2.23  The conclusion as to the journalist’s conduct was of pivotal importance in the Court’s overall 
determination.  This  case  also  illustrates  that  the  adjudication  by  the  Court  of  the  proper 
standards to be expected of journalists may lead to different views, which can be seen in the 
dissenting opinions which took the view that the conduct of the journalist in this case could 
not per se be held to fall short of the standard of proper journalistic care.

2.24 

2.25 

In the case of Stoll v Switzerland the Court explained that the ethics of journalism required a 
distinction to be drawn between the manner in which the applicant obtained the information 
and  the  form  of  the  impugned  articles.33  The  Court  undertook  a  detailed  analysis  of  the 
manner in which the journalist had obtained a report and considered the extent to which 
he was responsible for leaking the document or whether he had acted illegally. The Court 
also undertook a comprehensive analysis of the articles themselves, noting that the question 
whether the form of the articles published were in accordance with journalistic ethics carries 
weight, and concluded that there were a number of shortcoming in the articles in respect of 
the content, vocabulary, and editing of the article, including sensationalist style of headings, 
inaccuracies in the articles and prominence of the articles within the newspaper. The Court 
therefore agreed with the opinion of the Swiss Press Council that the articles were in breach 
of the declaration on the rights and responsibilities of journalists adopted by the Swiss Press 
Council. The Court concluded that the content of the articles and the fact they were likely to 
mislead detracted from their contribution to the public debate that is protected by Article 10.

In Flux (No 6) v Moldova it was held that the Court will examine whether the journalist who 
wrote  the  impugned  article  acted  in  good  faith  and  in  accordance  with  the  ethics  of  the 
profession of journalism.34 In the Court’s view, this depended in particular on the manner 
in  which  the  article  was  written  and  the  extent  to  which  the  applicant  newspaper  could 
reasonably regard its sources as reliable with respect to the allegations in question. The latter 
issue must be determined in light of the situation as it presented itself to the journalist at the 
material time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight.35 The Court considered that disregard 
of  journalistic  ethics  may  undermine  the  rights  of  others  guaranteed  by  the  Convention, 
holding that “the applicant newspaper acted in flagrant disregard of the duties of responsible 
journalism and thus undermined the Convention rights of others”36. An assessment of the 
ethics  of  journalism  appeared  to  be  clearly  embedded  in  the  Court’s  analysis,  concluding 
that:37

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials“… in a world in which the individual is confronted with vast quantities of information

of players, monitoring compliance with journalistic ethics takes on added importance”.

2.27 

2.26  Dissenting judgments in the case expressed the view that the decision of the majority had 
undermined  freedom  of  expression  and  that  the  chilling  effect  of  sanctions  against  press 
freedom had materialised through the decision of the Court.38
In  short,  the  current  case  law  underlines  the  importance  of  considering  the  conduct  of 
journalists  and  their  compliance  with  the  ethics  of  journalism  in  assessing  whether  any 
interference with freedom of expression is justified.
Section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998

2.28  Section  12  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  (HRA)  is  predominantly  a  procedural  provision 
dealing with the circumstances where the High Court is considering whether to grant any 
relief, typically an injunction restraining publication, which might bear on the right of freedom 
of expression in Article 10.

2.29  Section 12, as enacted, was introduced into the Bill by the Government during the committee 
stage in the House of Commons as a result of support for such a clause being expressed by 
Lord Wakeham, Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, and a number of newspaper 
groups, due to concern that the proposed legislation might otherwise impede freedom of 
expression  by  protecting  privacy  and  imposing  prior  restraint  on  newspapers.  During  the 
second  reading  debate  in  the  House  of  Commons,  the  Home  Secretary,  Jack  Straw  MP, 
announced that an amendment would be introduced into the Bill to protect press freedom in 
a manner which was consistent with the Convention.39

2.30  The purpose of section 12 was analysed by Lord Nicholls in Cream Holdings Limited v Banerjee 

in the following terms:40

“When the Human Rights Bill was under consideration by Parliament concern was 
expressed at the adverse impact the Bill might have on the freedom of the press. 
Article 8 of the European Convention, guaranteeing the right to respect for private 
life, was among the Convention rights to which the legislation would give effect. The 
concern was that, applying the conventional American Cyanamid approach, orders 
imposing  prior  restraint  on  newspapers  might  readily  be  granted  by  the  courts  to 
preserve  the  status  quo  until  trial  whenever  applicants  claimed  that  a  threatened 
publication  would  infringe  their  rights  under  article  8.  Section  12(3)  was  enacted 
to allay these fears. Its principal purpose was to buttress the protection afforded to 
freedom of speech at the interlocutory stage. It sought to do so by setting a higher 
threshold  for  the  grant  of  interlocutory  injunctions  against  the  media  than  the 
American Cyanamid guideline of a “serious question to be tried” or a “real prospect” 
of success at the trial.”

2.31  Section 12 applies where the court is considering whether to grant any relief which, if granted, 
might  affect the  exercise  of  the  Convention  right  to  freedom  of  expression.41  This  section 
provides that no such relief is to be granted so as to restrain publication before trial unless 
the court is satisfied that the applicant is likely to establish that publication should not be 
allowed.42

42 S12(3) 

1850

APPENDICES2.32  The meaning of “likely” was analysed by Cream Holdings Limited v Banerjee (supra) by Lord 
Nicholls who concluded that the effect of s12(3) is that the court is not to make an interim 
restraint order unless satisfied the applicant’s prospects of success at the trial are sufficiently 
favourable to justify such an order being made in the particular circumstances of the case.43 
As to what degree of likelihood makes the prospects of success sufficiently favourable, Lord 
Nicholls explained that:44

“the general approach should be that courts will be exceedingly slow to make interim 
restraint  orders  where  the  applicant  has  not  satisfied  the  court  he  will  probably 
(“more  likely  than  not”)  succeed  at  the  trial  …  but  there  will  be  cases  where  it  is 
necessary for a court to depart from this general approach and a lesser degree of 
likelihood will suffice as a prerequisite. Circumstances where this may be so include 
those mentioned above: where the potential adverse consequences of disclosure are 
particularly grave, or where a short-lived injunction is needed to enable the court to 
hear and give proper consideration to an application for interim relief pending the 
trial or any relevant appeal”.

2.33  The significance of s12(3) is that this sets a higher bar than the general law in relation to 
granting an interim injunction. The courts have clarified that there is no conflict between 
s12(3) and the Convention because s12(3) does not seek to give a priority to one Convention 
right over another. It is simply dealing with the interlocutory stage of proceedings and with 
how the court is to approach matters at that stage in advance of any ultimate balance being 
struck between rights which may be in conflict.45

2.34  Section 12(4) provides that the court must have particular regard to the importance of the 
Convention right to freedom of expression and, in particular where the proceedings relate 
to material which the respondent claims, or which appears to the court, to be journalistic, 
literary or artistic material the court must have regard to the extent to which the material 
has, or is about to become available to the public, or it is, or would be, in the public interest 
for the material to be published and any relevant privacy code.

2.35  The courts have rejected the argument that s12(4) has the effect that extra weight should be 
given to freedom of expression. In Ashdown v Telegraph Group Ltd, Lord Phillips MR rejected 
the argument that “must have particular regard to” means that the Court should place extra 
weight  on  the  matters  specified,  noting  that  s12  does  no  more  than  underline  the  need 
to  have  regard  to  contexts  in  which  the  ECtHR  has  given  particular  weight  to  freedom  of 
expression, while at the same time drawing attention to considerations which may none the 
less justify restricting that right.46 Section 12(4) does not require the court to treat freedom 
of speech as paramount.47

2.36  Section 12(4)(b) requires that the Court pay particular regard to any relevant privacy code 
when considering proceedings which relate to journalistic material. Therefore, if a newspaper 
has breached one of the provisions of the PCC Code, this is a factor which the Court can take

therefore represents an important part of the factual matrix within which the Court exercises 
its discretion.

2.37 

In summary, the object of media proprietors in lobbying for the inclusion of s12 in the HRA 
1998  was  to  prevent  the  development  of  privacy  law  and  to  prevent  prior  restraint.  It  is 
doubtful that s12 achieves either of these aims. The case law has repeatedly emphasised 
that s12(4) does not require the court to treat freedom of speech as paramount. The role 
of s12 is predominantly to establish a test for granting interim relief that differs from the 
conventional balance of convenience that is considered in civil proceedings, but otherwise 
adds little to the substantive law of Article 10. The view has been expressed by some human 
rights  commentators  that  s12  serves  no  sensible  purpose  and  there  is  some  force  in  this 
point.48

Protection of journalistic sources

Introduction

2.38  The Editors’ Code of Practice frames the relationship between a journalist and his source as 
giving rise to a “moral obligation” on the part of the journalist to protect confidential sources 
of information.49 The current legal position is that, under both international and domestic 
law, a journalist enjoys a “qualified right” to protect the confidentiality of a source. This right 
is guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention and section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 
1981, but is susceptible to being overridden by specifically defined competing considerations.

2.39  The  European  and  domestic  jurisprudence  on  the  protection  of  journalistic  sources  has 
repeatedly  emphasised  the  importance  of  the  protection  of  sources  as  inherent  in  the 
freedom of the press and necessary to preserve the ability of the press to perform its role 
as a public watchdog. The classic statement of this position is the decision of the European 
Court in Goodwin v United Kingdom:50

“Without  such  protection,  sources  may  be  deterred  from  assisting  the  press  in 
informing the public in matters of public interest. As a result the vital public-watchdog 
role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate 
and reliable information may be adversely affected”.

2.40 

In  domestic  law,  the  rationale  for  the  protection  of  sources  has  long  been  established.  In 
1981, Lord Denning gave the crux of the justification in these words:51

“If [newspapers] were compelled to disclose their sources, they would soon be bereft 
of information which they ought to have. Their sources would dry up. Wrongdoing 
would  not  be  disclosed.  Charlatans  could  not  be  exposed.  Unfairness  would  go 
unremedied.  Misdeeds  in  the  corridors  of  power,  in  companies  or  in  government 
departments would never be known.”

APPENDICESLegal right to protection of sources: domestic law

2.41  Prior  to  the  enactment  of  s10  of  the  Contempt  of  Court  Act  1981,  the  House  of  Lords  in 
British Steel Corporation v Granada Television Ltd noted that the relationship of confidence 
between a journalist and a source was such that it was in no different category to a doctor 
and a patient, or banker and customer and that in those cases the court has to decide in the 
particular  circumstances  whether  the  interest  in  preserving  the  confidence  is  outweighed 
by other interests to which the law attaches importance.52 The House of Lords reviewed the 
previous case law and confirmed that journalists had no absolute privilege so as to entitle 
them to refuse to disclose their sources of information. The Court adopted a test of necessity 
for overriding the confidence of a source and held that there is no immunity from disclosure 
of sources where disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice. Following this judgment, 
Parliament  passed  s10  of  the  Contempt  of  Court  Act  1981,  providing  a  qualified  right  for 
journalists to protect their sources.

2.42  Section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides that:

“No  Court  may  require  a  person  to  disclose,  nor  is  any  person  guilty  of  contempt 
of  Court  for  refusing  to  disclose,  the  source  of  the  information  contained  in  that 
publication for which he is responsible, unless it be established to the satisfaction of 
the Court that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or 
for the prevention of disorder or crime.”

2.43  As was noted by the House of Lords in Re an Inquiry under the Company Securities (Insider 
Dealing)  Act  1985  the  protection  afforded  by  s10  was  clearly  intended  primarily  for  the 
benefit of journalists. The Court held that:53

“the legislature in enacting section 10, manifestly intended that in court proceedings 
(1)  journalists  should  ordinarily  be  entitled  to  refuse  to  disclose  the  source  of  any 
information contained in any publication (2) if they are to be deprived of that privilege 
the party seeking disclosure will have to satisfy the court that disclosure is necessary 
in  the  interests  of  justice  or  national  security  or  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or 
crime.”

2.44  The House of Lords held in Secretary of State for Defence v Guardian Newspapers Ltd that 
s10  eliminated  the  old  practice  where  judges  exercised  their  discretion  in  determining 
whether sources should be disclosed and replaced judicial discretion with a rule of law which 
specifically  defines  the  circumstances  in  which  the  confidentiality  of  journalists’  sources 
could be revealed.54 Lord Diplock, discussing s10 generally, noted that the exceptions include 
no reference to the “public interest” generally.

2.45  The Court of Appeal in Financial Times v Interbrew CA noted that:55

“It will be observed that this provision creates no power or right of disclosure: what it 
does is assume the existence of such a power or right and place a strong inhibition on 
its exercise. It governs material received with a view to publication, whether published 
or not: see X Ltd v Morgan-Grampian Ltd [1991] 1 AC 1, 40, per Lord Bridge.”

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials2.46  The  Court  of  Appeal  also  clarified  that  s10  applies  to  material  received  with  a  view  to 

publication, whether published or not.56

2.47  Section 10 operates by giving a journalist a prima facie right to refuse to disclose a source, 
and no order can be made to this effect unless it can be established that disclosure of the 
source is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of 
disorder or crime.57 Even if it is shown that one of the exceptions is made out, for example that 
disclosure is necessary for the protection of national security, the court retains its discretion 
to decline to order the source. However, it is likely to be rare that the Court would decline to 
order disclosure in circumstances where the exception was made out, and would probably be 
limited to a situation where a journalist would be put at risk.58

2.48 

In  X  Ltd  v  Morgan-Grampian  (Publishers)  Ltd  Lord  Bridge  gave  guidance  on  the  general 
approach to be adopted to s10, noted that:59

“the judge’s task will always be to weigh in the scales the importance of enabling 
the ends of justice to be attained in the circumstances of a particular case on the 
one hand against the importance of protecting the sources on the other hand. In this 
balancing exercise it is only if the judge is satisfied that disclosure in the interests of 
justice is of such preponderating importance as to override the statutory privilege 
against disclosure that the threshold of necessity will be reached.”

Interpretation of the exceptions set out in section 10

2.49 

In  relation  to  the  phrase  “necessary  for  the  prevention  of  crime”  it  has  been  held  that 
“necessary”, although stronger than “useful or expedient”, is less strong than “indispensable”.60 
“Prevention of crime” is not restricted to a specific future crime, but means the deterrence 
and control of crime generally so that crimes allegedly already committed might come within 
the exception.61

2.50  “Necessary in the interests of justice” was initially given a restricted meaning in Secretary 
of State for Defence v Guardian Newspapers where Lord Diplock limited the phrase to the 
technical interests of the administration of justice.62 Lord Bridge adopted a broader approach 
in X v Morgan Grampian, finding that the phrase is wide enough to include the exercise of 
legal rights and self-protection from legal wrongs, whether or not by court action.63 He held 
that the “interests of justice” were not confined to technical sense of the administration of 
justice in the course of legal proceedings in a court of law. The sense in which it is used in 
section 10 is such that persons should be entitled to exercise important legal rights and to 
protect themselves from serious legal wrongs whether or not they result in legal proceedings. 
The House of Lords in Ashworth Hospital Authority v MGN Ltd confirmed that the definition 
of “interests of justice” in  s10 was wide enough to include  cases where the injured party 
sought some form of lawful redress other than litigation, thus preferring the approach of Lord 
Bridge of Harwich in X Ltd v Morgan- Grampian (Publishers) Ltd (see above) to Lord Diplock in 
Secretary of State for Defence v Guardian Newspapers Ltd, [1985] AC 339.64

APPENDICES2.51  The prevention of crime and national security are not the only good reasons for limiting the 
public interest in the confidentiality of sources: the interests of justice exception allows for 
a more detailed evaluation including the importance of the case for the claimant, the public 
interest in the information from the source, and the method by which the source obtained 
the material. “Necessary” has been interpreted to mean “really needed”.65

2.52 

In Ashworth Hospital Authority v MGN Ltd the House of Lords identified the following matters 
as relevant to the question of necessity: i) as a matter of principle the necessity for disclosure 
must be convincingly established, ii) limitations on the confidentiality of journalistic sources 
call for the most careful scrutiny by the Court, iii) the disclosure must be in order to meet a 
pressing social need, iv) the disclosure should be proportionate to the legitimate aim which 
is being pursued.66

2.53  An example of the approach of the Court to an order requiring disclosure of a source in the 
context of enquiries made by a regulatory body is the judgment of the House of Lords in In re 
An Inquiry under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985.67 In this case the House 
of Lords considered whether a journalist was entitled to immunity from disclosing his source 
of information contained in a publication in the context of an inquiry by inspectors under 
section 177 of the Financial Services Act 1986 into the leak of price-sensitive information. 
The journalist refused to answer questions in the course of the inquiry which might lead to 
the identification of his source and argued he had a reasonable excuse for refusing to answer 
questions on the basis that he was conferred with immunity by s10 of the Contempt of Court 
Act.

2.54  The House of Lords held that the effect of s10 is to recognise and establish that in the interests 
of a free and effective press it is in the public interest that a journalist should be entitled to 
protect their sources unless some other overriding public interest requires them to reveal 
it.68 It was in the public interest that a journalist should be entitled to protect their source of 
information unless one of the other matters of public interest referred to required it to be 
revealed. It was for the party seeking disclosure, in this case the inspectors, to satisfy the court 
that identification of sources was necessary for the prevention of crime. The House of Lords 
held that “necessary” could not be precisely defined, but the nearest paraphrase was “really 
needed” and that “prevention of crime” was not restricted to the prevention of particular 
crimes but was used in the broadest general sense of deterrence and containment.69 On the 
facts the inspectors had satisfied the Court that it was of real importance for the purposes of 
their inquiry that they should know what the journalist’s sources of information had been.

2.55  The facts of Ashworth Hospital Authority are instructive. The House of Lords considered an 
appeal by MGN Ltd against an order made by the High Court requiring it to identify who had 
provided it with the medical records of Ian Brady, a notorious convicted murderer detained 
in a secure hospital, parts of which had appeared in an article in their newspaper. The Court 
noted  that  both  s10  and  Article  10  have  a  common  purpose  in  seeking  to  enhance  the 
freedom of the press by protecting journalistic sources.70 It concluded that the approach set 
out by the ECtHR can be applied equally to s10 given that Article 10 is part of domestic law 
and that the application of s10 should follow the judgment on Article 10 in the decision of

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsthe ECtHR in Sunday Times v United Kingdom.71 That case established that the court has to be 
satisfied that the interference was necessary, having regard to the facts and circumstances 
prevailing in the specific case before it.72 Lord Woolf explained by reference to the speech of 
Lord Bridge in X Ltd v Morgan-Grampian (Publishers) Ltd, that the approach to be adopted in 
relation to s10 of the 1981 Act involved very much the same balancing exercise as is involved 
in applying Article 10 of the Convention.73

2.56  Following the judgment of the House of Lords the newspaper revealed only the name of the 
journalist who provided the story, and not the source at the hospital who had provided the 
medical records. The hospital sought disclosure of the source from the named journalist who, 
following a trial, succeeded in persuading the Court that the source should not be disclosed.74 
The hospital appealed to the Court of Appeal.75 The Court of Appeal held that the approach of 
the English courts to both s10 of the 1981 Act and Article 10 of the Convention should be the 
same.76 The question in a case to which s10 of the 1981 Act or Article 10 of the Convention 
applies is whether the claimant has shown that it is both necessary, in the sense of there 
being an overriding interest amounting to a pressing social need, and proportionate for the 
court to order the journalist to disclose the name of his source. The requirements of necessity 
and proportionality are separate but cover substantially the same area.77 Although the Court 
of Appeal was concerned that the Article 10 point should only have to be considered once 
(rather than, as transpired in this case, both at the behest of the newspaper and then the 
journalist), it upheld the decision of the trial judge.

Legal right to protection of sources: international instruments

2.57  Protection of journalistic sources is a right which is well recognised in countries around the 
world  by  virtue  of  international  agreements,  declarations  and  case  law.  The  instruments 
generally  adopt  as  the  starting  point  that  the  identity  of  sources  is  not  to  be  disclosed, 
although this may be outweighed by competing considerations.

2.58  The  principle  of  protecting  sources  has  been  recognised  by  the  United  Nations  since  the 
1950s. In 1952 the Sub-Commission on Freedom of Information and of the Press drafted a 
code of ethics which set out that:78

“…  discretion  should  be  observed  concerning  sources  of  information.  Professional 
secrecy should be observed in matters revealed in confidence; and this privilege may 
always be invoked to the furthest limits of law”.

2.59  The  UN  Special  Rapporteur  on  the  promotion  and  protection  of  the  right  to  freedom  of 

opinion and expression, in his report in 1997 noted that:79

given in favour of the hospital on 18 October 2002 on the basis that the application had been resolved in its favour by 
the decision in the MGN case: see [2003] EWCA Civ 663. The Court held that different issues could arise in this second 
round of the litigation which justified a substantive hearing

APPENDICES“the  protection  of  sources  assumes  primary  importance  for  journalists,  as  a  lack 
of  this  guarantee  may  create  obstacles  to  journalists’  right  to  seek  and  receive 
information,  as  sources  will  no  longer  disclose  information  on  matters  of  public 
interest. Any compulsion to reveal sources should therefore be limited to exceptional 
circumstances where a vital public or individual interest is at stake”.

2.60  The UN Commission on Human Rights set out in its Annual Resolution in 2005 that it was 
“stressing the need to ensure greater protection for all media professionals and for journalistic 
sources” and called for States to respect the right of protection of journalistic sources.80

2.61  The  Council  of  Europe  and  the  European  Parliament  have  issued  in  the  region  of  fifty 
declarations and other instruments relating to freedom of expression and the media since 
1949.  These  include  the  Resolution  on  the  Confidentiality  of  Journalists’  Sources  by  the 
European Parliament and amongst these the most significant is the recommendation made 
on 8 March 2000 relating to the protection of journalistic sources.81

2.62  The purpose of the recommendation was to reinforce and supplement the principles that 
had been established by the judgment of the European Court in Goodwin v United Kingdom 
and to provide a basis for common European minimum standards concerning the right of 
journalists not to disclose their sources of information.82

2.63  The  Committee  recommended  that  the  governments  of  member  states  implement  the 
practice and principles appended to the recommendation into domestic law. The principles 
set out in the recommendation are as follows:

“Principle 1 (Right of non-disclosure of journalists)

  Domestic law and practice in member states should provide for explicit and 
clear protection of the right of journalists not to disclose information identifying 
a source in accordance with Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the Convention) and the principles 
established herein, which are to be considered as minimum standards for the 
respect of this right.

Principle 2 (Right of non-disclosure of other persons)

  Other  persons  who,  by  their  professional  relations  with  journalists,  acquire 
knowledge of information identifying a source through the collection, editorial 
processing or dissemination of this information, should equally be protected 
under the principles established herein.

Principle 3 (Limits to the right of non-disclosure)

(a) The right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source must not 
be subject to other restrictions than those mentioned in Article 10, paragraph 2 
of the Convention. In determining whether a legitimate interest in a disclosure 
falling within the scope of Article 10, paragraph 2 of the Convention outweighs 
the public interest in not disclosing information identifying a source, competent 
authorities of member states shall pay particular regard to the importance of 
the right of non-disclosure and the pre-eminence given to it in the case-law 

80 The right to freedom of opinion and express on Human Rights Resolution 2005/38, 19 April 2005 
81 18 January 1994, Official Journal of the European Communities No C 44/34 
82 At paragraph 4 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Recommendation 

1857

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsof the European Court of Human Rights, and may only order a disclosure if, 
subject to paragraph b, there exists an overriding requirement in the public 
interest and if circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature.

(b) The  disclosure  of  information  identifying  a  source  should  not  be  deemed 

necessary unless it can be convincingly established that:

i.  reasonable alternative measures to the disclosure do not exist or have been 
exhausted  by  the  persons  or  public  authorities  that  seek  the  disclosure, 
and

ii.  the legitimate interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest 

in the non-disclosure, bearing in mind that:

•  an overriding requirement of the need for disclosure is proved,
the circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature,
• 
• 
the necessity of the disclosure is identified as responding to a pressing 
social need, and

•  member states enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing this 
need, but this margin goes hand in hand with the supervision by the 
European Court of Human Rights.

(c)  The above requirements should be applied at all stages of any proceedings 

where the right of non-disclosure might be invoked.

Principle 4 (Alternative evidence to journalists’ sources)
In legal proceedings against a journalist on grounds of an alleged infringement of 
the honour or reputation of a person, authorities should consider, for the purpose of 
establishing the truth or otherwise of the allegation, all evidence which is available 
to  them  under  national  procedural  law  and  may  not  require  for  that  purpose  the 
disclosure of information identifying a source by the journalist.
Principle 5 (Conditions concerning disclosures)

(a) The motion or request for initiating any action by competent authorities aimed 
at the disclosure of information identifying a source should only be introduced 
by persons or public authorities that have a direct legitimate interest in the 
disclosure.

(b) Journalists should be informed by the competent authorities of their right not 
to disclose information identifying a source as well as of the limits of this right 
before a disclosure is requested.

(c)  Sanctions against journalists for not disclosing information identifying a source 
should only be imposed by judicial authorities during court proceedings which 
allow for a hearing of the journalists concerned in accordance with Article 6 of 
the Convention.

(d) Journalists should have the right to have the imposition of a sanction for not 
disclosing their information identifying a source reviewed by another judicial 
authority.

(e) Where  journalists  respond  to  a  request  or  order  to  disclose  information 
identifying  a  source,  the  competent  authorities  should  consider  applying 
measures  to  limit  the  extent  of  a  disclosure,  for  example  by  excluding  the 

1858

APPENDICESpublic  from  the  disclosure  with  due  respect  to  Article  6  of  the  Convention, 
where  relevant,  and  by  themselves  respecting  the  confidentiality  of  such  a 
disclosure.

Principle  6  (Interception  of  communication,  surveillance  and  judicial  search  and 
seizure)

(a) The following measures should not be applied if their purpose is to circumvent 
the  right  of  journalists,  under  the  terms  of  these  principles,  not  to  disclose 
information identifying a source:

i. 

interception orders or actions concerning communication or correspondence 
of journalists or their employers,

ii.  surveillance orders or actions concerning journalists, their contacts or their 

employers, or

iii.  search  or  seizure  orders  or  actions  concerning  the  private  or  business 
premises, belongings or correspondence of journalists or their employers 
or personal data related to their professional work.

(b) Where information identifying a source has been properly obtained by police 
or judicial authorities by any of the above actions, although this might not 
have been the purpose of these actions, measures should be taken to prevent 
the subsequent use of this information as evidence before courts, unless the 
disclosure would be justified under Principle 3.

Principle 7 (Protection against self-incrimination)
The  principles  established  herein  shall  not  in  any  way  limit  national  laws  on  the 
protection against self-incrimination in criminal proceedings, and journalists should, 
as  far  as  such  laws  apply,  enjoy  such  protection  with  regard  to  the  disclosure  of 
information identifying a source.”

2.64  The Recommendation takes its cue from Article 10 of the Convention, namely that the right 
of  journalists  to  protect  their  sources  is  not  an  absolute  right,  but  may  be  overridden  if 
circumstances of a sufficiently serious nature are identified.83 The Recommendation follows 
the conventional balancing exercise under the Convention in respect of qualified rights: that 
interference with a right must pursue a legitimate aim and the infringement of the right must 
be proportionate.

2.65  The  Parliamentary  Assembly  Recommendation  1950  (2011)  entitled  “The  protection  of 
journalistic sources” reaffirmed that the protection of journalists’ sources of information is 
a basic condition for both the full exercise of journalistic work and the right of the public to 
be informed on matters of public concern.84 The Parliamentary Assembly noted with concern 
the large number of cases in which public authorities in Europe have forced or attempted to 
force journalists to disclose their sources, despite the clear standards set by the European 
Court and the Committee of Ministers.85

83 At para 6 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Recommendation 
84 Assembly debate on 25 January 2011 (4th Sitting). Text adopted by the Assembly on 25 January 2011 (4th Sitting) 
85 At paras 2-3. Para 5 restated that “Public authorities must not demand the disclosure of information identifying a 
source unless the requirements of Article 10, paragraph 2, of the Convention are met and unless it can be convincingly 
established  that  reasonable  alternative  measures  to  disclosure  do  not  exist  or  have  been  exhausted,  the  legitimate 
interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in the non-disclosure, and an overriding requirement of 
the need for disclosure is proved”. Further, “the disclosure of information identifying a source should therefore be limited 
to exceptional circumstances where vital public or individual interests are at stake and can be convincingly established.” 

1859

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials2.66  The 2011 Recommendation provides that the confidentiality of journalists’ sources must not 
be  compromised  by  the  increasing  possibilities  provided  by  technological  developments, 
for  example  the  power  of  public  authorities  to  control  the  use  by  journalists  of  mobile 
telecommunication  and  internet  media  and  the  interception  of  correspondence  and 
surveillance of journalists. In addition, the right of journalists not to disclose their sources 
of  information  is  a  professional  privilege  intended  to  encourage  sources  to  provide 
journalists with important information which they would not give without a commitment to 
confidentiality.

2.67  The seminal case of the European Court of Human Rights on journalistic sources is the case 
of Goodwin v United Kingdom.86 An order had been made by the domestic court under s10 
of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 which required a journalist to disclose the identity of a 
source that had provided details of a company’s confidential corporate plan. The purpose of 
the order was to permit the company to bring proceedings against the source. The ECtHR 
considered whether this amounted to an unlawful interference with Article 10.

2.68  The ECtHR held that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of 
democratic society. In particular, if journalists are forced to disclose their sources then the 
role of the press in acting as a public watchdog could be seriously undermined, because of the 
chilling effect that such disclosure would have upon the free flow of information. Accordingly, 
an order to disclose sources cannot be compatible with Article 10 unless there is an overriding 
requirement in the public interest.87 As a matter of general principle, the necessity for any 
restriction  on  freedom  of  expression  must  be  convincingly  established  and  the  restriction 
must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.88 The Court  stated that there must 
be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued by the 
disclosure order and the means deployed to achieve that aim.89

2.69  On the facts the ECtHR held that the order to disclose the source had to be viewed in light of 
the fact that publication had been restrained already and whilst the company had a further 
legitimate interest in ascertaining the identity of the source to prevent further dissemination 
of confidential material and terminating the employment of the source, the interests of a 
democratic  society  in  a  free  press  outweighed  these  interests.  Therefore  the  order  for 
disclosure of a source was disproportionate in the circumstances.90

2.70 

It  is  clear  that  the  protection  of  journalists’  sources  in  Article  10  extends  not  only  to  an 
order made by the court that a source be disclosed, but also to searches and the seizure of 
documents held by journalists at their offices and homes. For example, in Ernst and others v 
Belgium the ECtHR considered whether searches and seizures by the judicial authorities at 
their newspaper’s offices and their homes constituted a breach of their freedom of expression 
under  Article  10  and  a  violation  of  their  right  to  privacy  under  Article  8  of  the  European 
Convention.91 The ECtHR concluded that the searches and seizures violated the protection 
of  journalistic  sources  guaranteed  by  the  right  to  freedom  of  expression  and  the  right  to 
privacy. The Court considered that the searches and seizures, which were intended to gather 
information that could lead to the identification of persons who were leaking confidential 
information, came within the sphere of the protection of journalistic sources, an issue which 
called for the most careful scrutiny by the Court.

APPENDICES2.71  More recently, consideration of the principles relevant to the extent of the right to protect 
confidentiality of sources was set out by the ECtHR in Financial Times Ltd and Others v United 
Kingdom.92 The Financial Times and other UK newspapers complained that their Article 10 
rights  has  been  infringed  by  an  order  requiring  them  to  disclose  documents  to  a  Belgian 
company which could lead to identification of journalistic sources at the origin of a leak to the 
press in relation to a takeover bid. The European Court upheld the newspapers’ complaint, 
holding there was a violation of Article 10 and in that case, the balance was tipped in favour of 
the public interest in protecting journalistic sources. The Court held that although a disclosure 
order could serve the purpose of enabling the bringing of proceedings against a source, in 
order for it to be “necessary” under Article 10 to order disclosure it was not sufficient that the 
party seeking the order had merely shown that it would otherwise be unable to bring a claim 
or show a threatened legal wrong.93 Where leaked information subsequently published was 
alleged to be inaccurate, the duty of journalists to contribute to public debate by accurate 
reporting and the steps that had been taken by the journalist to verify the accuracy of the 
information was relevant to deciding whether the order for disclosure was justified, however 
the principle of protection of sources meant that that such matters could not be decisive.94 
Where an unauthorised leak had occurred and the source had not been identified a general 
risk of future leaks would always be present, therefore the aim of preventing further leaks 
could only exceptionally justify an order requiring disclosure of a source.95 On the facts, the 
Court held that the company’s interest in identifying and bringing proceedings against the 
journalist  was  insufficient  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in  the  protection  of  journalistic 
sources and that there had therefore been a violation of Article 10.

2.72  Whilst each case will turn on its own facts, the following principles can be derived the case 

law of the ECtHR:
(1) 

The right to freedom of expression in Article 10 encompasses safeguards and guarantees 
to the press, and protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for 
press freedom. An order for disclosure of a source cannot be compatible with Article 10 
unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest.
In accordance with the usual balancing exercising under the Convention, any restriction 
of Article 10 rights must pursue a legitimate aim, the necessity of any restriction on 
freedom of expression must be convincingly established and any restriction on the right 
must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

(2) 

2.73  The following factors will be relevant to undertaking this exercise:

(1)  Whether  alternative  means  of  discovering  the  identity  of  a  leak  of  information  had 
been pursued. For example in Roemen and Schmit v Luxembourg the Court considered 
that the fact that the authorities had searched the premises of journalists to discover 
the  identity  of  the  leak  without  searching  the  premises  or  interviewing  individuals 
responsible for investigating the matter was a fact in concluding that balance between 
the competing interests, namely the protection of sources on the one hand and the 
prevention  and  punishment  of  offences  on  the  other,  had  not  been  maintained.  It 
accordingly found a violation of the right to freedom of expression.96 In Ernst and others 
v Belgium the European Court concluded that the searches and seizures of documents 
from  journalists’  homes  and  offices  violated  the  protection  of  journalistic  sources 
guaranteed by the right to freedom of expression. In reaching this conclusion the Court

93 Ibid, at paras 64-66 
94 Ibid, at para 67

96 Application 51772/99, [2003] ECHR 102

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials(2) 

questioned  whether  other  means  could  not  have  been  employed  to  identify  those 
responsible for the breaches of confidence and, in particular, took into consideration 
the fact that the police officers involved in the operation of the searches had very wide 
investigative powers.97
The interest of an employer in identifying the source of a leak of confidential material 
in order to terminate an employee’s employment is unlikely in itself to be sufficient to 
justify the disclosure of a source. It has been held that it is not enough to show that 
without disclosure the party seeking disclosure would be unable to bring a claim or 
assert a threatened legal wrong.98 Further, the aim of preventing future leaks would 
only exceptionally justify an order for disclosure.99

(3)  Disclosure may be proportionate where a journalist holds information which may assist 
the prevention of a serious crime. For example in Nordisk Film & TV A/S v Denmark the 
European Court held that a court order requiring disclosure of research material which 
had been compiled whilst making a documentary on paedophilia was a proportionate 
interference  with  the  journalist’s  freedom  of  expression,  namely  the  prevention  of 
crime in the case of serious child abuse.100
It would be relevant whether a journalist had acted in good faith and in accordance 
with the ethics of journalism to provide accurate and reliable information.101 The steps 
taken to verify the accuracy of information would also be relevant but not decisive.
The conduct of the source would also be relevant but not a decisive factor.102

(5) 

(4) 

Conclusion

2.74  A journalist’s right to protect the confidentiality of his or her sources is well recognised in 
both domestic and European law. Successive decisions of the courts as well as international 
declarations and recommendations have emphasised the importance of the protection of 
sources in promoting a free press and exercise of the freedom of expression. However, such 
rights carry responsibilities and the case law has also made clear that the conduct of both the 
source and the journalist will be relevant to the balancing exercise undertaken in weighing up 
the purpose served by disclosure with the underlying right to confidentiality. The assessment 
of these competing aims is highly fact sensitive and the weight given to different factors will 
vary depending on the circumstances of each individual case.

The  concept  of  privacy  is  one  which  divides  opinion,  both  in  relation  to  the  scope  of  its 
protection and the manner in which it should be protected. This debate invariably requires 
reflection upon the fundamental right of freedom of expression and the extent to which the 
media are entitled to exercise this freedom without unjustifiably impinging upon the rights 
of private individuals.

The common law has historically taken a conservative approach to the protection of privacy 
and the courts have demonstrated reluctance to develop a general cause of action for the 
protection of privacy rights. The courts have previously adopted the stance that a specific 
right  to  privacy  could  only  be  recognised  by  Parliament  and  therefore  individuals  seeking 
to protect private information or restrain publication turned to the creative application of 
existing causes of action.103 For example, the law of confidentiality was invoked to restrain the 
publication of material with a personal or private dimension.104 Some concern was expressed 
at the implementation of Article 8 through the less than satisfactory means of requiring the 
Court to “shoehorn” within the cause of action of breach of confidence claims for misuse 
of private information, and it is right to observe that the tort of breach of confidence is not 
necessarily a good fit for complaints which focus on the intrusive nature of the publication, 
as opposed to the exposure of ‘secret’ information through publication.105

However, in the period 1997-1998 Parliament enacted three statutes which shape the law 
providing protection against interference with privacy. First, the Protection from Harassment 
Act 1997 (PHA) provides a remedy for invasion of privacy which involves a course of conduct 
which  the defendant knows or ought to know amounts to harassment, including  conduct 
causing alarm or distress.106 The PHA protects against both publication of information and 
the conduct of the press in obtaining information; for example door-stepping and intrusive 
investigations. Secondly, the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) sets out a comprehensive regime 
for the processing of personal data and provides a remedy where privacy is invaded, both 
through publication or other methods of processing data.107 Thirdly, Parliament enacted the 
Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). From 2 October 2000, when the HRA came into force, Articles 
8 and 10 were incorporated in the law of England and Wales as substantive and enforceable 
rights.

The enactment of the HRA did not result in automatic recognition of a general tort of invasion 
of privacy, as the House of Lords clarified in Wainwright v Home Office.108 However the HRA 
represented an important stepping-stone in the path to the development of the law to protect 
unjustified invasion of privacy, provoking lively discussion of the impact that the Act would 
have on the development of a law protecting privacy.109

Despite  these  three  Acts  of  Parliament  signalling  recognition  of  the  need  to  bolster 
privacy rights, the Government made clear that it anticipated that the Courts would bear 
the  responsibility  of  developing  the  law  of  privacy  appropriately,  having  regard  to  the 
Convention.110 This task was taken up by the House of Lords in the seminal case of Campbell 

103 See for example the remarks of Leggatt LJ in Kaye v Robertson [1991] FSR 62, CA 
104 In the Spycatcher case, AG v Guardian Newspapers (No 2) [1990] 1 AC 109 Lord Goff explained that the tort 
of breach of confidence encompassed the following principles: i) the principle of confidentiality only applies to 
information to the extent that it is confidential, ii) the duty of confidence applies neither to useless information, nor 
to trivia, iii) although the basis of the law’s protection of confidence is that there is a public interest that confidences 
should be preserved public interest may be outweighed by some other countervailing public interest which favours 
disclosure. This approach was applied to try to protect information being imparted in circumstances of confidence 
and to seek to restrain publication of information to the world at large. See for example Prince Albert v Strange (1849) 
2 De G & Sm 652; 1 Mac & G 25, matrimonial secrets, Argyll v Argyll [1967] Ch 302, and information about sexual 
relationships, Stephens v Avery [1988] 1 Ch 449

v MGN Ltd in which the House recognised a new cause of action, namely misuse of private 
information, as distinct from breach of confidence.111

This  cause  of  action  is  now  the  closest  thing  to  a  free-standing  right  to  protection  from 
invasion of privacy in English law. The core element of privacy in this context is whether the 
person  in  question  had  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy  in  respect  of  the  information 
and whether interference with that expectation is justified. The law after Campbell therefore 
recognised two distinct causes of action, protecting two different interests: privacy (misuse 
of private information) and secrecy (breach of confidence).112

The cause of action recognised in Campbell is the product of three features of the law. Firstly, 
the rights enshrined in Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention are incorporated into domestic 
law and individuals have a right to bring a claim for infringements of these rights. Secondly, 
the State is obliged to protect an individual from unjustified invasion of their private life by 
another individual.113 Thirdly, the Courts are subject to a duty to avoid acting incompatibly 
with Convention Rights, and so must, in determining claims, give effect to Convention rights.114 
It is unsurprising, given these features, that the law relating to misuse of private information 
requires a rights-based analysis and that the jurisprudence of the ECtHR has shaped domestic 
law in this area.115

Since the landmark decision in Campbell, the law relating to misuse of private information has 
evolved on a case by case basis, both through the decisions of the ECtHR in this area which 
are absorbed into domestic law, and through the body of domestic case law that has built 
up over the years as the Courts deal with interim applications seeking to restrain publication 
of material and the smaller number of final hearings, or trials of alleged misuse of private 
information. The Court of Appeal has recently described the law in this field as “well travelled 
(if fast moving)” and the principles applicable are considered in detail below.116

A  significant  proportion  of  claims  brought  to  restrain  publication  on  the  basis  that  the 
proposed publication unjustifiably interferes with an individual’s privacy involve a claim for 
misuse  of  private  information.  However,  the  legal  framework  which  has  the  potential  to 
protect privacy interests is broader and it is through a combination of the common law of 
misuse of private information and breach of confidence, and actions based on the PHA and 
DPA, that the law has established a comprehensive framework for the protection of privacy 
rights.  The  framework  is  overlapping  in  some  respects,  and  it  is  not  unusual  for  cases  to 
pursued based on more than one cause of action.117

Human Rights Act 1998

3.10  The HRA has had a significant impact on the development of the law to protect privacy in 
two material respects. Firstly, s6 of the HRA requires the courts (as a public authority) to 
act compatibly with Convention rights. In this context the key Convention rights are Article

117 For example, Campbell v MGN Ltd [2004] 2 AC 457 is an example of successful claims both for misuse of private 
information and for breach of the DPA. In CC v AB [2007] EMLR 11 claims were made for misuse of private information 
and under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. In Carina Trimingham v Associated Newspapers Limited [2012] 
EWHC 1296 (QB) claims were brought pursuant to the PHA 1997 and misuse of private information

APPENDICES8 (respect for private life) and Article 10 (freedom of expression and the right of the general 
public to receive information). Secondly, by s2(1) a court is also required to take into account 
judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, and by virtue of this provision the ECtHR’s 
case law has informed the development of domestic law. For this reason it is necessary to 
dwell briefly on the scope of Articles 8 and 10 in this context.

3.11  Article 8 provides as follows:

“Article 8: Right to Respect for Private and Family Life
1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his 
correspondence.
2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right 
except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society 
in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the 
country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, 
or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”

3.12  The  scope  of  Article  8  and  the  meaning  of  “private  and  family  life”  has  been  analysed 
extensively in case law. The ECtHR has stated that private life is a broad term not susceptible 
to  exhaustive  definition,  but  includes  elements  such  as  gender  identification,  name  and 
sexual orientation, sexual life, mental health, the right to identity and personal development 
and to establish and develop relationships: Bensaid v United Kingdom.118

3.13  The House of Lords in R (Countryside Alliance) v A-G addressed the scope of private life within 
the meaning of Article 8. Baroness Hale observed that Article 8 protects a “private space” and 
the “personal and psychological space within which each individual develops his or her own 
sense of self and relationship with other people”.119

3.14  However, it is now well established that protection of reputation is a right which is covered by 

the right to respect for private life under Article 8.120

3.15  Article  8  does  not  confer  an  absolute  right  to  privacy:  Article  8(1)  provides  for  a  right  to 
“respect” for privacy and therefore is inherently qualified. The right is further qualified by 
Article 8(2). The purposes of the qualifications are to ensure that the core of Article 8 is not 
read so widely that its claims became unreal and unreasonable.121 Safeguards against a overly 
broad reading of Article 8 include the parameters that the threat to a person’s Article 8 rights 
must attain a certain level of seriousness, that absent an expectation of privacy there will be 
no interference with personal autonomy and that the breadth of Article 8(1) may be curtailed 
by the scope of the justifications in Article 8(2): see Laws LJ in R (Wood) v Commissioner of 
Police for the Metropolis.122

3.16 

It is clear that the words “the right to respect for ... private ... life” which appear in Article 8 
require not only that the State refrain from interfering with private life but also entail certain 
positive obligations on the State to ensure effective enjoyment of this right by those within 
its jurisdiction.123 Such an obligation may require the adoption of positive measures designed 
to  secure  effective  respect  for  private  life  even  in  the  sphere  of  the  relations  between 
individuals.124

1865

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.17  Article 10 is dealt with in some detail at paragraph 2.10 onwards above. In short, Article 10 
protects the right to freedom of expression, which encompasses the right to hold and impart 
opinions and ideas and the right to receive information and ideas. In general terms Article 
10 protects the freedom of the press and the plurality of the media, although the degree of 
protection extended to particular types of expression will vary depending on the content. 
Reporting on matters of public interest will invariably attract a greater degree of protection 
than gossip about an individual’s private life.125

3.18  Article 10(2) expressly acknowledges that interference with Article 10 rights may be justified 
in order to protect the rights and the reputation of others. Article 10(2) permits a wide range 
of interests to be invoked as a justification for imposing restrictions on freedom of expression. 
Those  most  commonly  invoked  are  the  right  to  reputation  or  protection  of  privacy,  often 
referred to as the tort of misuse of private information in domestic law.

3.19 

It is the interplay between Article 8 and Article 10 rights that shapes the cause of action of 
misuse of private information.

Breach of confidence

3.20  Whilst misuse of private information will be the most relevant cause of action for individuals 
seeking to protect their privacy, the principles that relate to breach of confidence remain 
relevant, as it may be easier for a claimant to establish on the particular facts that a breach 
of confidence is actionable, and the existence of a relationship of confidence may support a 
claim for misuse of private information, or may be determinative of the claim.126

3.21  The starting point is to determine whether there is a relationship or duty of confidence. This 
may be by reason of express terms in a contract (for example an employment contract), or 
by reason of an implied term (for example an implied term that an employee will not use or 
disclose for the duration of his employment confidential information gained in the course of 
that employment). An obligation of confidence may also arise through the common law, and 
the courts have recognised that there are three elements to an action for breach of confidence. 
First, the information must have the quality of confidence. Secondly, the information must 
have been imparted in circumstances of confidence. Thirdly, there has been an unauthorised 
use of the information.127

3.22 

In order to satisfy the first element, namely that the information has the quality of confidence, 
the information must not be widely available in the public domain. The courts have developed 
a comprehensive set of principles through case law, which assist in defining when personal 
information  may  have  a  quality  of  confidence.  Many  of  these  factors  overlap  with  the 
first stage of a misuse of private information claim; namely whether there is a reasonable 
expectation of privacy. These factors include whether the subject matter is of an intimate 
nature,  whether  the  information  is  either  believed  or  expressly  stated  to  be  confidential, 
the  extent  to  which  access  to  the  information  is  controlled  or  protected  and  the  form  of 
the information. Generally material will not have the necessary quality of confidence if the 

125 See Armonienė, cited above, at 39 
126 For example, in Browne v Associated Newspapers Limited [2006] 1 QB 103, the Court noted that the existence of 
a previous relationship of confidence was of considerable importance in determining whether the claimant had a 
reasonable expectation of privacy. See also on this issue the analysis of Tugendhat J as to what constitutes a breach of 
confidence in Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis & Anor v Times Newspapers Ltd & Another [2011] EWHC 2705 
(QB) at paras 94-140 
127 AG v Observer Ltd [1990] 1 AC 109 and Douglas v Hello! Ltd [2008] 1 AC 1 at para 307 

1866

APPENDICESinformation is trivial tittle-tattle.128 For example, in Mills v News Group Newspapers Ltd, on the 
particular facts of the case the court considered that the triviality of the claimant’s address 
was a factor against granting an injunction.129 The courts have also sought to distinguish the 
levels  of  detail  which  may  attract  a  duty  of  confidence,  for  example  in  Theakston  v  MGN 
Ltd, Ouseley J drew a distinction between that fact that a television presenter had visited a 
brothel, from the details of what had occurred there.130

3.23 

In terms of the second element, it needs to be demonstrated that confidential information 
comes to the knowledge of a person in circumstances where he is on notice, or has agreed, 
that the information is confidential.131 The element of unauthorised use of the information 
requires an analysis of the confidant’s conscience and whether the person would, or should, 
be troubled by the disclosure of the information.132

3.24  Where a third party acquires information  from a person  who  himself  is  subject  to a duty 
of confidence, the third party receiving the information may be restrained by an injunction 
from further disclosure of the information on the basis that the third party assumes a duty 
of confidence to the original confider. However, the extent of any relief will depend on the 
circumstances of the case. In order not to subvert an order of the court, a duty of confidence 
has been crafted that is binding on media organisations even where there has been no breach 
of confidence: see Venables v News Group Newspapers Ltd where the court imposed a duty 
of confidence on defendant news organisations and persons not party to the litigation with 
knowledge of the whereabouts and appearances of the killers of Jamie Bulger who, at the 
time of the killing, were 10 years of age.133

3.25  There  are  a  number  of  possible  defences  to  claims  for  breach  of  confidence,  including 
consent to disclosure, waiver of the duty of confidence, or where the party seeking to restrain 
disclosure is relying on an unlawful restricting provision. Further, where the information is 
false there is generally no duty of confidence, although careful enquiry will be necessary to 
establish whether the information merely has a number of minor inaccuracies or can be said 
to be completely false before this principle is applied.

Remedies

3.26  Most  commonly  a  party  will  seek  an  injunction  to  prevent  disclosure  of  the  confidential 
information.  Often  an  injunction  will  be  sought  on  an  interim  basis  to  prevent  disclosure 
once the alleged breach of confidence comes to light. An interim injunction is unlikely to be 
granted where either the material will be published in the near future in any event, or where 
there is a lack of particularity as to the material that is confidential. A final injunction may be 
granted in relation to an actual or threatened breach of confidence. The courts more readily 
grant injunctions in respect of personal information than trade secrets, the latter being more 
readily assessed in monetary terms suitable for an award of damages.134

3.27  An injunction will bind the party to whom the injunction is addressed although third parties 
may be liable for contempt if they act in a manner which is contrary to the terms of an interim 
injunction of which they have notice so as to frustrate the purpose of the judge in making

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsthe order; this is known as the ‘Spycatcher principle’.135 Further, the test for the grant of an 
injunction in defamation cases is higher than for an interim injunction in breach of confidence 
claims and the courts will not allow parties to seek an interim injunction on the basis of a 
claim for breach of confidence where in reality what is sought to be protected is material that 
is said to be untrue and damaging to reputation.

3.28  The courts also have discretion to order the delivery up of and destruction of documents, 

articles or machinery obtained or made in breach of confidence.

3.29  Damages may be sought in addition to, or instead of an injunction and can be sought for 
both past and future losses. There is some uncertainty as to the extent of damages that may 
be awarded for breach of personal confidence and doubt has been expressed as to whether 
shock  and  distress  caused  by  the  unauthorised  disclosure  of  confidential  information  can 
properly be reflected in an award of damages, however given that the courts have recognised 
that damages can be awarded for injury to feelings in cases of misuse of private information it 
may be that a parallel approach will be taken in breach of confidence matters.136 An alternative 
remedy which may be sought by the claimant is an account of profits, namely depriving the 
defendant of the profits resulting from the misuse of confidential information and awarding 
these profits to the claimant.

Misuse of private information

Establishment of cause of action

3.30 

In A v B plc Lord Woolf CJ explained that the court, as a public authority, was able to fulfil 
its duty under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 Act “by absorbing the rights which 
Articles 8 and 10 protect into the long-established action for breach of confidence”.137

3.31  The leading domestic case remains the decision of the House of Lords in Campbell v MGN Ltd, 
which recognised a cause of action for misuse of personal information.138 This claim is quite 
distinct from the claim of breach of confidence, with its foundations in Article 8 and 10 of the 
ECHR. Lord Nicholls observed that:139

“The time has come to recognise that the values enshrined in Articles 8 and 10 are 
now part of the cause of action for breach of confidence … and are as much applicable 
in disputes between individuals or between an individual and a non-governmental 
body such as a newspaper as they are in disputes between individuals and a public 
authority”.

3.32  On the basis that information about an individual’s private life is more naturally described as 
private than confidential, Lord Nicholls said that “the essence of the tort is better encapsulated 
now as misuse of private information”.140

3.33  The  elements  of  the  cause  of  action  were  defined  in  the  following  way  by  the  House  of 

Lords:141

135 A-G v Newspaper Publishing plc [1988] Ch 333 at 375 and 380

APPENDICES(1) 

(2) 

The information at issue engages Article 8 of the Convention by being within the scope 
of the claimant’s private or family life, home or correspondence; and
The  conduct  or  threatened  conduct  of  the  defendant  is  such  that,  upon  analysis  of 
the  proportionality  of  interfering  with  the  competing  rights  under  Article  10,  it  is 
determined that the protection of the rights of others makes it necessary for freedom 
of expression to give way.

3.34  The  threshold  test  for  whether  Article  8  is  engaged  by  the  publication,  or  threatened 
publication,  of  information  in  any  given  case  is  “whether  in  respect  of  the  disclosed  fact 
the person in question had a reasonable expectation of privacy”.142 Lord Hope defined the 
question as “whether the information that was disclosed was private and not public”, noting 
that:143

“in some cases … the answer to the question whether the information is public or 
private will be obvious. Where it is not, the broad test is whether disclosure of the 
information about the individual (“A”) would give substantial offence to A, assuming 
that A was placed in similar circumstances and was a person of ordinary sensibilities”.

3.35  The court will then proceed to determine whether the interference is proportionate. Where 
both Articles 8 and 10 are engaged, a balance must be struck, or the competing requirements 
of  the  Articles  reconciled,  by  the  application  of  the  principle  of  proportionality.144  This 
requires  a  focused  and  penetrating  consideration  of  the  proposed  interference  with  the 
Article 8 right if publication occurs without remedy, and the value and proposed interference 
with the Article 10 right if a remedy is granted. There are different degrees of privacy, just 
as there are different orders of expression ranging in importance from political expression 
through educational or artistic expression to commercial expression.145 The key issue is the 
weight to be given to each of the rights at stake in any particular case. As Lady Hale put it, the 
proportionality of interfering with one right has to be balanced against the proportionality of 
restricting the other.146

3.36  The Court of Appeal in Murray v Express Newspapers summarised the principles set out in 

Campbell in the following way:147

(1) 

The right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention and the 
right to respect for a person’s privacy enshrined in Article 8 are vitally important rights. 
Both lie at the heart of liberty in a modern state and neither has precedence over the 
other.

(2)  Although the origin of the cause of action relied upon is breach of confidence, since 
information about an individual’s private life would not, in ordinary usage, be called 
confidential, the more natural description of the position today is that such information 
is private and the essence of the tort is better encapsulated now as misuse of private 
information.
The  values  enshrined  in  Articles  8  and  10  are  now  part  of  the  cause  of  action  and 
should be treated as of general application and as being as much applicable to disputes 
between individuals as to disputes between individuals and a public authority.

Essentially the touchstone of private life is whether in respect of the disclosed facts the 
person in question had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
In  deciding  whether  there  is  in  principle  an  invasion  of  privacy,  it  is  important  to 
distinguish between the first question whether Article 8 is engaged, and the subsequent 
question whether, if it is, the individual’s rights are nevertheless not infringed because 
of the combined effect of Articles 8(2) and 10.

3.37 

It is self-evident that Articles 8 and 10 are of the utmost importance in the reasoning process 
undertaken by the court; they are now “the very content of the domestic cause of action that 
the English court has to enforce”.148

Elements of cause of action of misuse of private information

3.38  The two-stage test formulated in McKennitt v Ash149 per Buxton LJ frequently cited in the case 

law, is as follows:

(1)   First,  the  court  must  ask  whether  the  information  is  private  in  the  sense  that  it  is 
in  principle  protected  by  Article  8  and,  if  so,  whether  the  person  has  a  reasonable 
expectation of privacy in respect of the information. If the answer is no, that is the end 
of the case.
If yes, the second question is whether in all the circumstances, the Article 8 rights of the 
claimant must yield to the right to freedom of expression conferred on the defendant 
by Article 10.

3.39 

In  Hutcheson  (formerly  known  as  “KGM”)  v  News  Group  Newspapers  Ltd  and  others,  the 
Court of Appeal cited the well-established test applied at first instance:150

“First, it is necessary to demonstrate that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy 
in respect of the subject-matter in question, having regard to article 8 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. If that hurdle is overcome, 
it next has to be shown that there is no countervailing public interest sufficient to 
outweigh his right to protect that information. At the second stage, the court will 
apply  what  has  been  termed  ‘an  intense  focus’  to  the  particular  circumstances  of 
the case, in order to arrive at a determination of where the balance lies between the 
competing rights concerned.”

3.40  This summary encapsulates the test neatly.

3.41  The two stage approach is applied to both substantive actions (a trial of the claim) and interim 
injunctions;  although  in  the  latter  context  the  test  must  be  considered  in  the  light  of  the 
burden imposed on the claimant to satisfy the Court that there are sufficient prospects to 
justify an injunction in view of the test in section 12 of the HRA.

3.42 

It  is  important  to  recognise  that  Article  8  is  engaged  irrespective  of  whether  the  private 
information sought to be published is true or false.151

APPENDICESStage 1 – Is there a reasonable expectation of privacy?

3.43  The key issue to be resolved by the court is whether the information sought to be protected 
is of a private, as distinct from a public, nature and whether the claimant has a reasonable 
expectation of privacy in respect of that information.

3.44  The law does not protect unreasonable demands to keep information out of the public sphere 
or ‘hyper-sensitive’ claimants and, for this reason, the question whether there is a reasonable 
expectation  of  privacy  is  an  objective  test  considered  in  light  of  the  circumstances  of  the 
claimant. Lord Hope in Campbell emphasised that the reasonable expectation was that of the 
person who is affected by the publicity:152

“The question is what a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities would feel if she 
was placed in the same position as the claimant and faced with the same publicity”.

3.45  The Court of Appeal in Murray v Express Newspapers summarised the position as follows:153

“As we see it, the question whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy is 
a broad one, which takes account of all the circumstances of the case. They include 
the  attributes  of  the  Claimant,  the  nature  of  the  activity  in  which  the  Claimant 
was engaged, the place at which it was happening, the nature and purpose of the 
intrusion, the absence of consent and whether it was known or could be inferred, the 
effect on the Claimant and the circumstances in which and the purposes for which the 
information came into the hands of the publisher.”

3.46  The  court  does  not  address  questions  of  privacy  in  terms  of  generalities.  According  to 
the authorities set out  above, the question  must be whether this  particular person  has a 
reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the particular information at issue.154

Factors which guide the Court’s decision on the stage 1 analysis

3.47  There are a number of matters to which the Court is likely to have regard in determining 
whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. These include, the following factors, 
which are not necessarily exhaustive:

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) 

The nature of the information itself (namely its content)
The form of the information (namely the medium in which it is kept)
The effect of disclosure on the claimant (and other relevant individuals)
The attributes of the claimant
The circumstances in which the information came into the hands of the publisher
The extent to which information is already in the public domain

Nature of the information

3.48  The nature of the information itself is likely to be significant in determining whether there 
is a reasonable expectation of privacy and there are certain types of information which the 
courts have readily been persuaded to describe as private information.

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.49 

Information  relating  to  physical  or  mental  health  has  been  held  to  lie  at  the  heart  of  the 
protection afforded by Article 8.155 The courts have recognised that personal information about 
individuals held in medical records, reports or interviews is both confidential and private: 
Venables v News Group Newspapers Ltd.156 In Campbell the House of Lords recognised that 
the Claimant’s therapy for drug addiction related to treatment directed at her physical and 
mental health and was akin to the private information contained in medical records, although 
Lady Hale identified that not every statement about a person’s health will carry the “badge 
of confidentiality”.157

3.50  Sexual behaviour and sexual orientation are an aspect of private life and are protected by 
Article 8. For example, the ECtHR in PG and JH v United Kingdom held that elements such as 
gender identification, name, sexual orientation and sexual life are important elements of the 
personal sphere protected under Article 8.158

3.51 

In  Mosley v News  Group  Newspapers  Ltd, Eady  J considered in  some depth  the extent to 
which revelations concerning sexual relations could lawfully be made by the media.159 Among 
other things, he reasoned as follows:160

“It has now to be recognised that sexual conduct is a significant aspect of human life 
in respect of which people should be free to choose”.

3.52  The judge noted that anyone indulging in sexual activity is entitled to a degree of privacy, 
especially if it is on private property and between consenting adults.161 In articulating the 
standards expected of the media in this context, Eady J expressed his view that it is not for 
the state or for the media to expose sexual conduct which does not involve any significant 
breach of the criminal law, and this is the case whether the motive for such intrusion is merely 
prurience or a moral crusade:162

“It is not for journalists to undermine human rights, or for judges to refuse to enforce 
them, merely on grounds of taste or moral disapproval. Everyone is naturally entitled 
to espouse moral or religious beliefs to the effect that certain types of sexual behaviour 
are wrong or demeaning to those participating. That does not mean that they are 
entitled to hound those who practise them or to detract from their right to live life as 
they choose”.
“…where the law is not breached ... the private conduct of adults is essentially no-one 
else’s business. The fact that a particular relationship happens to be adulterous, or 
that someone’s tastes are unconventional or “perverted”, does not give the media 
carte blanche”.

3.53  Whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy between parties to a sexual relationship 
depends on the circumstances, and where the sexual conduct amounts to unlawful conduct, 
or  conduct  that  is  grossly  immoral,  that  may  prevent  the  claimant  from  protecting  the 
information relating to it. The length of the relationship may be relevant. An expectation of 
privacy may not be reasonable in relation to a fleeting encounter, in contrast to a long term 
relationship.163

APPENDICES3.54 

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  law  more  readily  protects  the  details  of  a  sexual 
relationship than the mere fact of a sexual relationship, or than the fact of sexual orientation 
per se. In Goodwin v NGN Ltd it was held that the fact that details of a sexual relationship are 
confidential or private does not necessarily mean that the bare fact of a sexual relationship 
is private, citing by way of example the case of Ntuli in which the judge at first instance had 
granted an anonymised Claimant an injunction restraining an anonymised Defendant from 
publishing, amongst other information “the fact that the Claimant had a relationship with the 
Defendant”.164 The Court of Appeal in that case varied the injunction, and named the parties 
and the fact of their relationship. Maurice Kay LJ observed that:165

“the material in respect of which Mr Donald has been found to have a reasonable 
expectation of privacy is not detailed in the judgment. The material in the judgment 
does not attract a reasonable expectation of privacy.”

3.55  The approach of the Court to the issue of whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy 
in respect of a sexual relationship and sexuality can be further illustrated by Trimingham v 
Associated  Newspapers  Ltd.  Both  cases  reveal  that  the  fact  of  a  relationship  may,  or  may 
not, attract a reasonable expectation of privacy depending on the particular circumstances 
of each case, although the statement in Goodwin that it is rarely realistic for partners in a 
relationship  to  expect  that  the  fact  of  their  relationship  will  remain  confidential  between 
the two of them for a long or indefinite period may signal an approach which tends towards 
disclosure of the fact of the relationship.166

3.56 

In Goodwin, the court explained that the circumstances why there might be a reasonable 
expectation of privacy of the fact of the relationship include when an abusive family will not 
allow the couple to be together and the fact of the relationship being known could create 
a risk of harm. By contrast, circumstances why the fact of a relationship may not attract a 
reasonable expectation of privacy include those where parties to a relationship are proud of, 
or at least content to disclose, the relationship. The court held there was not a reasonable 
expectation of privacy of the fact of a relationship between Fred Goodwin, the then Chief 
Executive of RBS and ‘VBN’, an employee of RBS, relying on the following reasons. Firstly, if an 
employee has a sexual relationship with a more senior person in the company there are any 
number of possible misunderstandings and grievances (whether well founded or not) that can 
arise if the fact of the relationship is not known, at least to the work colleagues of the more 
junior of the two partners to the relationship. Secondly, the extent to which men in positions 
of power benefit from that power in forming relationships with sexual partners who are less 
senior within the same organisation is also a matter which is of concern to an audience much 
wider  than  the  work  colleagues  of  either  partner  in  the  relationship.  The  court  held  that 
whatever limits there may be to the legal concept of a public figure, or of a person carrying 
out official functions, Fred Goodwin came within the definition, and distinguished him from 
sportsmen and celebrities in the world of entertainment, who do not come within it.167

3.57  However, the court held that VBN did have a reasonable expectation that her name would not 
be published by the press. The court permitted disclosure of her job description, even though 
the court recognised that this might lead some people to identify her, on the basis that she 
was unlikely to establish that prohibiting publication of her job description was necessary and 
proportionate for the protection of her rights.168

1873

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.58 

In  Trimingham  v  Associated  Newspapers  Limited  the  Court  took  a  robust  approach  to  the 
expectation of privacy of the claimant’s sexuality.169 The Court was asked to consider whether 
the claimant, a bisexual woman living in a civil partnership who had conducted an affair with 
a married politician, had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of her appearance 
and her sexuality. Tugendhat J held that in light of the fact that the claimant had i) entered 
into a civil partnership recently and was actually living with her civil partner, ii) had engaged 
in a sexual relationship with a man who was a prominent politician, and who had conducted 
the election campaign the previous month in circumstances where revelation of the affair to 
the public at large was inevitable and, iii) that even before the revelation of her affair with 
the politician she had had relationships with other men, and those who knew her knew of 
her sexuality, it was unarguable that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy as to her 
sexuality. The court concluded that the claimant was not the purely private figure she claimed 
to be and that her reasonable expectation of privacy had become limited, mainly by reason 
of her involvement with a prominent politician, both professionally as his press agent, and 
personally by way of the sexual relationship, in circumstances where he campaigned with a 
leaflet to the electorate about how much he valued his family, but also by reason of what she 
herself had disclosed in the past. Therefore, despite the fact that the Defendant referred to 
the claimant’s sexuality in 65 articles over about 15 months, it only did so (a) when writing 
about matters of public interest, mainly developments in the politician’s personal life which 
were  relevant  to  his  public  life,  and  (b)  when  the  claimant  and  her  conduct  (and  other 
information about her) were within the range of what an editor could in good faith regard as 
relevant to the story.170

3.59  The Courts have recognised that home is one of the matters expressly included in Article 
8(1) of the Convention as deserving respect. In McKennitt v Ash, the judge at first instance 
protected  the  description  of  a  person’s  home  as  private  and  confidential  information, 
noting  that  to  convey  such  details  without  permission  to  the  general  public  is  almost  as 
objectionable as spying into the home with a long distance lens and publishing the resulting 
photographs.171 Another example of this approach can be observed in Beckham v MGN Ltd 
in which an injunction  was obtained restraining the publisher  of a tabloid  magazine from 
publishing unauthorised photographs of the interior of a new home on the basis that this 
would invade the family’s privacy and compromise their security.172

3.60 

It is generally recognised that material obtained under compulsory powers for the purposes 
of criminal proceedings cannot be used for purposes other than those for which the powers 
were conferred and the same principle applies where the information has not been obtained 
through the use of compulsory powers but the threat of them.173 Convictions and acquittals 
are  generally  not  private,  although  the  High  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  grant  an  injunction 
to  prohibit  publication  of  the  identities  of  individuals  accused  and  convicted  of  criminal 
offences.174 There may be circumstances in which information about criminal convictions is 

169 [2012] EWHC 1296 (QB). The Claimant is pursuing an appeal against this decision. Permission to appeal has been 
granted by the Court of Appeal but a hearing date has not yet been fixed. Any conclusions to be drawn from the case 
will have to be reviewed in the light of the appeal

court has power to lift these restrictions where it is appropriate to do so

APPENDICEScapable of being protected as private, for example in the case of Venables where court orders 
have the effect of preventing publication of the present identities of the two claimants who 
had been provided with new identities having been convicted, as 10 year old children, of 
murder.

3.61 

It  has  been  held  that  a  person  has  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy  in  relation  to  his 
or her financial affairs.175 Information relating to business affairs may also be protected by 
relationships of confidence. However, once financial affairs have been raised in open court, 
the information will not always retain its character as private. It is also important to recognise 
that information relating to the salaries of public figures may not be regarded as part of their 
private lives.176

Form of information

3.62 

In addition to the content of the information, the source or form of the information is likely 
to have a significant bearing on whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.177 For 
example,  personal  diaries,  private  written  communications  and  private  conversations  are 
generally more likely to fall within the sphere of private information than conversations in 
public places or photographs taken in a private place.

3.63  The law relating to the restriction of information about appearance, primarily through the 
publication of photographs, has developed rapidly and not always consistently. The Courts 
have recognised that the publication of photographs have the potential to be particularly 
intrusive. In Douglas v Hello! Ltd the Court of Appeal recognised that:178

“…  special  considerations  attach  to  photographs  in  the  field  of  privacy.  They  are 
not  merely  a  method  of  conveying  information  that  is  an  alternative  to  verbal 
description.  They  enable  a  person  viewing  the  photograph  to  act  as  spectator,  in 
some circumstances voyeur would be a more appropriate noun, of whatever it is that 
the photograph depicts. As a means of invading privacy, a photograph is particularly 
intrusive”.

3.64  The mere taking of a photograph may not involve an interference with privacy but clandestine 
recording may be regarded in itself as an unacceptable infringement of Article 8 rights. 179 Well 
known examples where the publication of a photograph has been held to amount to misuse of 
personal information include publication of a model leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting 
(Campbell), and the video of the Head of Formula 1 participating in sadomasochistic sexual 
activities (Mosley). Other examples include injunctions granted to protect the publication of 
unauthorised photographs of an actress in a private hotel and photographs of a television 
presenter in a brothel.

3.65 

In Von Hannover the ECtHR made clear that photographs of ordinary events in a person’s life 
in public may nevertheless engage Article 8.180 However, the domestic courts remain cautious 
in granting protection to routine activities which are part and parcel of daily life and played

177 In HRH Prince of Wales v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2008] 1 CH 57, the Court of Appeal explained that it was not 
easy to identify the extent to which information is private because of the nature of the information or because of the 
form in which it is conveyed and usually these facts form an interdependent amalgam of circumstances

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsout in public. In Campbell, Baroness Hale doubted that to photograph the claimant going 
out to buy milk would engage Article 8.181 Lord Hope in Campbell drew a distinction between 
someone who photographed a person by chance in the street, as against where a photo was 
taken in secret with a view to publication.182 The Court of Appeal in Murray addressed the 
potential conflict between the positions in Von Hannover and Campbell and concluded that 
no clear distinction could be drawn between family activities and routine acts, such as a visit 
to the shops, and that each case depended on its own circumstances.

3.66 

In  the  recent  case  of  Von  Hannover  (No.2)  the  ECtHR  recognised  that  in  the  absence  of 
evidence of harassment or illegal activity on the occasion that a photo complained of was 
taken, the restriction on publication of a photo taken in a public place which is innocuous and 
inoffensive will generally not outweigh Article 10 considerations.183 The Von Hannover cases 
are considered further below.

3.67  Correspondence is specifically protected by Article 8. The ECtHR in Copland v UK held that 

personal emails are included within private life for the purpose of Article 8.184

3.68  The  ECtHR  has  been  prepared  to  treat  telephone  conversations  as  within  the  scope  of 
“correspondence” in Article 8 and has held that telephone-tapping of private conversations 
may breach Article 8.185

3.69  The courts have held on numerous occasions that private journals and diaries are confidential 
documents.186 However, it does not invariably follow that all the information contained in 
private  journals  will  be  protected,  in  particular  in  circumstances  where  details  disclose 
misconduct  that  falls  outside  the  scope  of  a  reasonable  expectation  of  privacy,  or  where 
details contained in the diary do not relate to the applicant.187

3.70 

3.71 

Effect on applicant and other affected persons
In Campbell a number of their Lordships considered that the extent of harm to the claimant 
was a significant factor in determining whether her rights had been infringed by the disclosures 
at issue. This follows from the fact that the tort of misuse of private information seeks to give 
effect to human dignity and autonomy and, as Lady Hale identified, damage to private life 
and  to  physical  or  moral  integrity  are  key  elements  in  determining  whether  a  reasonable 
expectation of privacy existed.188

It  is  not  just  the  effect  on  the  applicant  that  must  be  considered  but  others  that  may  be 
affected by publication, including family members. This point was underlined in ETK v News 
Group Newspapers Ltd, where particular weight was placed on the interests of the children, 
the court observing that the purpose of the injunction is both to preserve the stability of the 
family and to save the children the ordeal of playground ridicule that would inevitably follow 
publicity.189

both because it would undermine the family as a whole and because the playground is a cruel place where the bullies 
feed on personal discomfort and embarrassment” 

1876

APPENDICESAttributes of the claimant

3.72  A number of cases have tended to draw a distinction between a public and a private figure 
and suggest that individuals who can properly be described as public figures may enjoy a 
lesser degree of protection than others, although the extent of this distinction has not been 
consistently applied in case law. The jurisprudence in this area is not always straightforward 
to follow and the courts, initially inclined to adopt the concept of involuntary role models, 
appear to have retreated from this approach.

3.73 

In  A  v  B  plc  a  married  professional  footballer  failed  in  his  attempt  to  restrain  a  national 
newspaper from publishing details of his sexual relationships with two women who wished 
to sell their stories. The Court of Appeal held that:190

“Even trivial facts relating to a public figure can be of great interest to readers and 
other observers of the media. Conduct which in the case of a private individual would 
not be the appropriate subject of comment can be the proper subject of comment 
in  the case  of  a  public  figure.  The  public  figure  may  hold  a  position  where higher 
standards of conduct can be rightly expected by the public. The public figure may be a 
role model whose conduct could well be emulated by others. He may set the fashion. 
The higher the profile of the individual concerned the more likely that this will be the 
position. Whether you have courted publicity or not you may be a legitimate subject 
of public attention. If you have courted public attention then you have less ground to 
object the intrusion which follows. In many of these situations it would be overstating 
the position to say that there is a public interest in the information being published. 
It  would  be  more  accurate  to  say  that  the  public  have  an  understandable  and  so 
legitimate interest in being told the information. If this is the situation then it can be 
appropriately taken into account by a Court when deciding on which side of the line 
a case falls.”

3.74  This decision represents a high water mark from which the courts have since retreated. Recent 
case law suggests that the courts have refrained from making findings that a person is a role 
model, however where a person’s professional life or job description carries an expectation 
of high standards of behaviour the courts will take this into account.191 Thus, the concept of 
some public figures being involuntary role models having a lesser entitlement to privacy was 
questioned in Campbell v MGN Ltd.192 Lord Phillips MR noted that “the fact that an individual 
has achieved prominence on the public stage does not mean that his private life can be laid 
bare by the media”, and similarly the mere fact that a person is a public figure who has a 
relationship with the media does not disentitle them from a right to privacy.193

3.75  These  latter  sentiments  were  echoed  in  Strasbourg  authority  which  demonstrated  some 
reluctance to accept that prominent public figures are effectively stripped of their protection 
by virtue of their position. For example, in Craxi (No.2) v Italy the Court found that the rights 
of a former Italian Prime Minister had been violated by the playing in a domestic court of his 
covertly recorded private telephone conversations during the course of his prosecution for 
corruption, and held that public figures (even politicians of the highest order) are entitled 
to the enjoyment of the guarantees in Article 8 on the same basis as every other person.194 
Similarly, in Tammer v Estonia, the Court held that the sexual life of senior politicians can be 
wholly protected from publicity, finding that the penalties imposed by the national authority

were not a violation of Article 10.195

3.76  Having made the point that A v B might represent one high water mark, Craxi and Tammer 
might be thought of as the high water mark for protecting public figures. The seminal case of 
Von Hannover v Germany196 adopts a less protective approach, namely that the public right’s 
right to know about the lives of public figures can in certain circumstances extend to the 
private life of public figures, particularly where politicians are concerned, but this will depend 
on  the  particular  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  individual’s  role  and  duties.  In  this  case 
Princess Caroline of Monaco complained about pictures of her engaging in ordinary activities 
in public places. The ECtHR held that, in balancing the Article 8 and 10 rights, “a fundamental 
distinction” had to be made between reporting facts capable of contributing to a debate in a 
democratic society relating to, for example, politicians in the exercise of their functions, and 
reporting details of the private life of an individual who, as in Princess Caroline’s case, does 
not exercise official functions. The court held that:197

“…the decisive factor in balancing the protection of private life against freedom of 
expression should lie in the contribution that the published photos and articles make 
to a debate of general interest. It is clear in the instant case that they made no such 
contribution  since  the  Applicant  exercises  no  official  function  and  the  photos  and 
articles related exclusively to details of her private life.”

3.77  Significantly,  and  no  doubt  correctly,  in  McKennitt  v  Ash  it  was  suggested  that  A  v  B  was 

inconsistent with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Von Hannover.198

3.78  More recently in Von Hannover (No.2)199 the Court was concerned again with a complaint 
of  Princess  Caroline  of  Monaco  that  photographs  taken  during  a  family  holiday  had  been 
published with articles commenting on the Price’s poor health. The Court upheld the finding 
of  the  domestic  court  that  the  health  of  the  reigning  Prince  of  Monaco  was  a  matter  of 
general interest and press were entitled to report on how the Prince’s children reconciled 
their family obligations with legitimate needs of their private life, including holidaying. The 
Court  accepted  that  the photos,  considered in  the light  of  the accompanying  articles, did 
contribute to a debate of general interest.200

3.79 

In  Murray  v  Express  Newspapers  it  was  held  that  the  law  should  protect  children  from 
intrusive media attention, at any rate to the extent of holding that a child has a reasonable 
expectation that he or she will not be targeted in order to obtain photographs in a public 
place for publication which the person who took or procured the taking of the photographs 
knew would be objected to on behalf of the child.201

Circumstances in which information comes into the hands of the publisher

3.80  Whilst breach of confidence is a distinct cause of action and misuse of private information 
may arise without there being any confidential relationship, the existence of a confidential 
relationship  can  be  an  important  consideration  as  to  whether  there  is  a  reasonable 
expectation of privacy. Where the proposed publication is set against a backdrop of a pre-
existing relationship of confidence between the parties, the need for protection is greater.

APPENDICES3.81  The test for breach of a confidence was set out by the House of Lords in Douglas v Hello! 
Ltd  as  follows.  First,  the  information  itself  must  have  the  necessary  quality  of  confidence 
about it. Secondly, that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an 
obligation of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorised use of that information to 
the detriment of the party communicating it.202

3.82 

In the case of Lord Browne of Madingley v Associated Newspapers Ltd the Court of Appeal 
accepted the principle that a pre-existing relationship between the relevant persons or parties 
is of enormous importance in answering in the affirmative Lord Nicholls’ question (as set out 
in Campbell) about whether the subject of the disclosure has a reasonable expectation of 
privacy in the information to be published.203 However it is important to recognise that the 
existence of a prior relationship of confidence is not determinative.204

Information in the public domain

3.83  The  expectation  of  privacy  in  some  circumstances  may  be  limited  by  the  extent  to  which 
information has already entered the public domain. The law will not restrain publication where 
this would serve no useful purpose, in other words where the re-publication of information 
would not have a significant effect. Consideration of this issue is relevant both to the Stage 
1 question of reasonable expectation of privacy and to conducting the balancing exercise at 
Stage 2.205

3.84  The “public domain” is not always easy to define. In this regard there is potentially an important 
distinction between information which is made available to a person’s circle of friends or work 
colleagues and information which is widely published in a newspaper.206 Whether information 
is known to the public at large is a matter of fact and degree for determination in each case 
depending on its specific circumstances.

3.85  The position can be summarised in a nutshell by reference to the remarks in Douglas v Hello!, 
that  once  intimate  personal  information  about  a  celebrity’s  private  life  has  been  widely 
published, it may serve no useful purpose to prohibit further publication.207 However, the 
Courts have been slow to conclude that no useful purpose would be served by injunctive 
relief unless the information has been widely publicised. For example, in CTB v News Group 
Newspapers Ltd, Tugendhat J continued an injunction in favour of protecting the identity of 
a professional footballer in spite of wide publicity revealing his identity on the grounds that 
continuing publicity would constitute unwarranted harassment.208

207 [2005] EWCA Civ 595 at para 105. This case reiterated (with particular references to photographs) the sentiment 
of Lord Goff in Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers (No 2) [1991] AC 109 at 260 E-H that harm may be caused by 
repetition of facts already known to an earlier but different readership 
208 [2011] EWHC 1334. It was said “It is obvious that if the purpose of this injunction were to preserve a secret, it would 
have failed in its purpose. But in so far as its purpose is to prevent intrusion or harassment, it has not failed. The fact 
that tens of thousands of people have named the claimant on the internet confirms that the claimant and his family 
need protection from intrusion into their private and family life. The fact that a question has been asked in Parliament 
seems to me to increase, and not to diminish the strength of his case that he and his family need that protection.” See 
also the previous judgments in this case CTB v News Group Newspapers Ltd & Another [2011] EWHC 1232 granting 
anonymity and then CTB v NGN and Another [2011] EWHC 1326 (QB) (an early application to vary the injunction). Also 
see Giggs v NGN [2012] EWHC 431 (QB) in which Eady J declined to continue the anonymity of the footballer 

1879

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.86 

It will be relevant to consider whether repeated publication is likely to engage Article 8 and 
further invade privacy. For example, in Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No.3) all members of the House 
of  Lords  accepted  that  privacy  could  be  invaded  by  further  publication  of  information  or 
photographs already available to the public.209

3.87  Where information is put into the public domain by claimant themselves, the mere fact that 
a claimant has made limited disclosures about a particular area of his or her private life will 
not necessary prevent a claim for further, unauthorised publication of material in the same 
area.210  However,  previous  disclosure  by  the  claimant  may  limit  the  scope  of  reasonable 
expectation of privacy in a particular case. In Axel Springer the fact that a well known actor 
“had actively sought the limelight” in the past, revealing details about his private life in a 
number of interviews, meant that his “legitimate expectation” that his private life would be 
effectively protected was thereby reduced.211

3.88 

In X & Y v Persons Unknown the Court held that there is a real distinction between what is 
written about an individual on the one hand and what he or she himself puts or agrees to 
put into the public domain on the other.212 Eady J, in granting an injunction against further 
dissemination of allegations about the state of the claimants’ marriage carefully scrutinised 
the press cuttings produced by the defendant containing references to or quotations from the 
claimants, noting that careful attention needed to be paid by the court as to how information 
had been made public – distinguishing between celebrities being prepared to go along with 
‘lifestyle’ pieces without wishing to cross boundaries into personal relationships and those 
who took the view that any publicity is good publicity. It is clear there is no hard and fast rule 
and in each case the court will have to examine the specific evidence and make an evaluation 
(on which, inevitably, there may be room for differing opinions).

3.89 

In  Ferdinand  v  MGN  Ltd  Nicol  J  did  not  accept  the  argument  that  the  Claimant  had  no 
reasonable expectation of privacy because explicit details about his sex life were already in 
the public domain as a result of the publication of previous articles (some of which resulted 
from disclosures by him, and others where he had not denied them or taken any action).213 
Nicol J stated that:214

“the Claimant had not, before the article, disclosed anything about his relationship 
with [a particular woman]. It is not necessary to consider whether in an extreme case 
there would be some merit in the argument that widespread and extensive discussion 
by a person of similar aspects of their private life would disentitle them to have a 
reasonable expectation of privacy. The present case is nowhere near that extreme. 
In this context, the Claimant was also entitled to say that the articles alleging affairs 
with other women were not published with his consent and the fact that he had not 
litigated them could not be taken as his tacit acceptance of another article, let alone 
another article about a different woman.”

in a national newspaper

APPENDICESPlace where the conduct occurs

3.90  As a general principle a person is entitled to expect that information about their behaviour in 
their home or another private place is and will remain private. However, protection of activities 
undertaken in public, in particular photographs or video recordings, has been expanded by 
the case law. For example, in Campbell the majority of the House of Lords concluded that 
the publication of photographs taken in a public place was actionable. In Murray the Court 
of Appeal held that a child of famous parents arguably had a reasonable expectation that 
photographs  would  not  be  taken  of  him  for  publication  whilst  in  a  pushchair  on  a  public 
street. The circumstances in which the photographs were taken is also relevant, this issue 
has been addressed recently in Von Hannover (No 2) in which the Court held that there was 
not infringement of Article 8 by the publication of photographs taken in public (namely in a 
street of a skiing resort). The ECtHR held that the domestic court was correct to analyse the 
circumstances in which the photographs were taken including whether they have been taken 
surreptitiously or in a climate of harassment, but that there was no evidence to suggest that 
this was the case.215

False information

3.91  Unauthorised  disclosure  of  personal  information  may  be  actionable  even  if  the  claimant 

contends that some or all of the material is false: see McKennitt v Ash. Buxton LJ stated:216

“that provided the matter complained of is by its nature such as to attract the law of 
breach of confidence, then the Defendant cannot deprive the claimant of his Article 8 
protection simply by demonstrating that the matter is untrue”.

Latham LJ went further in his concurring judgment, saying that:

“..the truth or falsity of the information is an irrelevant inquiry in deciding whether 
the information is entitled to be protected and judges should be chary of becoming 
side-tracked into that irrelevant inquiry.”

3.92  The  rationale  for  this  approach  appears  to  be  that  the  courts  are  reluctant  to  require  a 
claimant to spell out which of the allegations are true or false, Eady J observing in Beckham 
v Gibson that this would defeat the purposes of the injunction.217 This marks a departure 
from the law relating to breach of confidence where it has long been held that there can be 
no confidentiality in false information. Therefore in the context of a tort of misuse of private 
information, the truth or falsity of the information disclosed is of minor relevance, although 
in Campbell, it was observed by Lord Hope that:218

“there is a vital difference between inaccuracies that deprive the information of its 
intrusive quality and inaccuracies that do not”.

Stage 2 – Balancing exercise between Articles 8 and 10

3.93  The second stage has been referred to by the Courts as the “ultimate balancing test” and the 
“parallel analysis” and requires an assessment of the comparative importance of the two 
rights.

1881

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.94  The interaction between Articles 8 and 10 was explained by Lord Nicholls in Campbell v MGN 

Ltd:219

“Article  8(1)  recognises  the  need  to  respect  private  and  family  life.  Article  8(2) 
recognises  there  are  occasions  when  intrusion  into  private  and  family  life  may  be 
justified. One of these is where the intrusion is necessary for the protection of the 
rights and freedoms of others. Article 10(1) recognises the importance of freedom 
of expression. But article 10(2), like article 8(2), recognises there are occasions when 
protection of the rights of others may make it necessary for freedom of expression to 
give way. When both these articles are engaged a difficult question of proportionality 
may arise. This question is distinct from the initial question of whether the published 
information engaged article 8 at all by being within the sphere of the complainant’s 
private or family life.”

3.95  Lord Steyn in Re S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on publication) noted that neither 
Article 8 nor Article 10 has precedence over the other and that where the values protected 
by the two articles are in conflict an intense focus on the comparative importance of the 
rights being claimed is necessary. Further, the justification for interfering with or restricting 
each right must be taken into account and finally the proportionality test must be applied to 
each (also known as the ultimate balancing test). In conducting this balancing exercise, the 
courts have acknowledged that this process will require an “intense focus on the facts of the 
individual case”.220

3.96  On the Article 8 side, the more intimate the aspect of private life that is interfered with the more 
serious must be the reasons for the interference before the restriction can be legitimate.221 
When striking a balance between competing rights the court is not restricted to considering 
the Article 8 rights of the claimant and the defendant but should take into account the extent to 
which other individuals would be affected by publication; for example the claimant’s family.222 
In many cases the claimant’s privacy interests will align with those of their family and the rights 
of family members may have a significant impact in determining these issues.

3.97  On the Article 10 side, different types of speech have varying levels of protection. Lady Hale 
in Campbell explained that political speech is top of the list and that the free exchange of 
information and ideas on matters relevant to the organisation of the economic, social and 
political life of the country is crucial to any democracy and that without this, it can scarcely be 
called a democracy at all. Further, intellectual and educational speech and expression are also 
important in a democracy, not least because they enable the development of the potential 
for an individual to play a full part in society, including in democratic life. Artistic speech and 
expression is important for similar reasons; fostering both individual originality and creativity 
and the free-thinking and dynamic society we so much value. Lady Hale doubted whether the 
political and social life of the community and the intellectual, artistic or personal development 
of individuals is assisted by poring over the intimate details of a fashion model’s private life, 
for example.223

3.98  Thus, as a matter of approach, there is a hierarchy of both privacy interests and of freedom 
of  expression  rights.  The  more  intimate  the  nature  of  the  information  and  the  closer  the 
information is aligned to Article 8, the greater weight the court will accord to the information

in the balancing exercise. Similarly the more important the nature of speech being exercised, 
the more weight will be given to this.

In Von Hannover v Germany (No 2), various factors were identified by the Court as being 
relevant to the consideration of how the competing Convention Articles could be balanced. 
These included: the status of the person concerned (distinguishing between private individuals 
and  persons  acting  in  an  official  or  public  context  such  as  politicians),  the  subject  matter 
of the report (distinguishing between the press as a public watchdog and as a reporter of 
private facts about well known people), the prior conduct of the person concerned (noting 
that simply because an individual has co-operated with the press does not deprive them of 
privacy) and the form or content of the publication and its consequences.224 The ECtHR in 
Axel Springer, identified similar factors as relevant to the “criteria for the balancing exercise”: 
(1) contribution to a debate of general interest, (2) how well known the person concerned 
was  and  what  was  the  subject  matter  of  the  report,  (3)  the  prior  conduct  of  the  person 
concerned, (4) the method used to obtain the information and its veracity, (5) the content 
form and consequences of the publication, and (6) the severity of the sanction imposed.225

Public interest in publication

3.100  The most significant factor in the balancing exercise is the extent to which the information 
sought to be disclosed can truly be said to make a contribution to a debate of general interest. 
For  example,  the  contribution  that  the  published  information  would  make  to  a  debate  of 
general interest was treated as the decisive factor in ETK v NGN Ltd.226

3.101  Two  key  issues  need  to  be  considered  in  this  context,  namely  what  is  meant  by  “public 

interest” and who the arbiter of the meaning of public interest is.

3.102  The meaning of “public interest” is hard to pin down. The courts have drawn a distinction 
between matters which contribute to a debate on matters in the public interest and matters 
which are simply of interest to some members of the public. A striking and oft-quoted aphorism 
in this context is the observation of Lord Wilberforce in British Steel v Granada Television, that 
“there is a wide difference between what is interesting to the public and what is in the public 
interest to make known”.227 A statement to a similar effect is that of Stephenson LJ explained 
in Lion Laboratories v Evans, “the public are interested in many private matters which are no 
real concerns of theirs and which the public have no pressing need to know”.228

3.103  In Goodwin v NGN Ltd the Court found there to be a public interest in disclosure, not because 
the publication would expose serious impropriety or crime but because it is in the public 
interest that there should be public discussion of the issues raised by the publication, namely 
the circumstances in which it is proper for a person holding public office or exercising official 
functions to carry on a sexual relationship with an employee in the same organisation.229 It 
was held that:230

228 (1985) QB 526 
229 [2011] EWHC 1437 (QB) at para 133; it was held that “it is in the public interest that newspapers should be able 
to report upon cases which raise a question as to what should or should not be a standard in public life. The law, and 
standards in public life, must develop to meet changing needs. The public interest cannot be confined to exposing 
matters which are improper only by existing standards and laws, and not by standards as they ought to be, or which 
people can reasonably contend that they ought to be.” 
230 paras 136-137, ibid 

1883

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials“it is in the public interest that newspapers should be able to report upon cases which 
raise  a  question  as  to  what  should  or  should  not  be  a  standard  in  public  life.  The 
law, and standards in public life, must develop to meet changing needs. The public 
interest cannot be confined to exposing matters which are improper only by existing 
standards and laws, and not by standards as they ought to be, or which people can 
reasonably contend that they ought to be.”

However, the Court emphasised that:

“[As  a]  matter  of  principle,  the  right  to  respect  for  private  life  of  persons  holding 
responsible positions cannot be overridden in the interests of freedom of expression 
simply because a newspaper alleges that they might have a worry that might distract 
them from doing their jobs. It cannot be right that the press should be free to interfere 
with a person’s private and family life by exposing confidential information, and then 
seek to justify that by speculating that the information might have distracted him 
from doing his job.”

3.104  In  Mosley  v  UK,  the  ECtHR  recognised  the  distinction  between  reporting  facts,  even  if 
controversial, capable of contributing to a debate of general public interest in a democratic 
society, and making tawdry allegations about an individual’s private life.231 In respect of the 
former, the pre-eminent role of the press in a democracy and its duty to act as a “public 
watchdog” are important considerations in favour of a narrow construction of any limitations 
on  freedom  of  expression.  However,  different  considerations  apply  to  press  reports 
concentrating on sensational and, at times, lurid news, intended to titillate and entertain, 
and which are aimed at satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership regarding aspects of 
a person’s strictly private life. Such reporting does not attract the robust protection of Article 
10 afforded to the press. Critically, the court confirmed the Article 10 right of members of 
the public  to have access to a wide range of publications  covering a variety of fields, but 
stressed that in assessing whether there is a public interest which justifies an interference 
with the right to respect for private life, the focus must be on whether the publication is in 
the interests of the public and not whether the public might be interested in reading it.

3.105  The Strasbourg authorities have also carefully scrutinised claims of public interest in relation 
to intimate details of persons’ private lives. In Campany Y Diex de Revenga v Spain, the Court 
was concerned with the publication of a sex scandal between an aristocrat and a banker and, 
in rejecting the complaint of breach of Article 10, held that even though the persons were 
known to the public the reports could not be regarded as having contributed to debate on a 
matter of general interest to society.232

3.106  In considering the public interest in any publication it is important for the court to focus on 
the precise nature of the proposed publication and on the facts of an individual case, rather 
than reciting considerations of a generalised nature. In McKennitt, Eady J emphasised that:233

“[it  is]  necessary  to  scrutinise  with  care  any  claims  to  public  interest  –  which  are 
sometimes made by the media and their representatives on a rather formulaic basis”.

3.107  This does not sit easily with the submission advanced by some media groups, for example 
News  International,  that  it  is  a  common  misconception  that  the  media  must  justify  any 
publication which involves private information of any kind by pointing to a specific public

APPENDICESinterest in the publication of the particular information in question.234 Although the point 
may be well made in instances where the alleged infringement of privacy is at too low a level 
as to engage Article 8 and whilst the Court in A v B plc stated that any inference with the press 
has to be justified irrespective of whether a particular publication is desirable in the public 
interest, the case law over the past decade has revealed that in any case where Article 8 is 
clearly engaged the courts will require the media to demonstrate the public interest in the 
particular publication and this will be highly material in the balancing exercise.235

3.108  The issue of who should be the arbiter of public interest has been the subject of analysis 
in recent authority. The case law suggests that it is for the court to determine whether the 
proposed publication would be in the public interest, although this position is not without its 
difficulties. In Mosley v News Group Newspapers Limited, Eady J held that on the current state 
of the authorities it is for the court to decide whether a particular publication was or was not 
in the public interest, and that there was little if any scope for considering the defendant’s 
state of mind  “because it is  only  the court’s decision  which counts on the central issue of 
public interest”.236

3.109  However, this position in respect of misuse of private information can be contrasted with 
the  provisions  of  the  DPA  in  which  the  exemption  available  to  the  media  in  section  32  is 
dependent upon the data controller reasonably believing that publication would be in the 
public interest and therefore the enquiry pursued by the Court is into the state of mind of 
the data controller and whether their belief was a reasonable one.237 Similarly, Parliament 
has amended the data protection legislation to provide for a public interest defence to the 
criminal offence in section 55 (although this section has not been brought into force), and the 
terms of this defence focus on whether the media defendant acted in the reasonable belief 
that its processing of data was in the public interest, and not on whether it actually was in 
the public interest.

3.110  These provisions were considered by Tugendhat J in Terry v Persons Unknown, where it was 
observed that there was uncertainty in the existing law as to the extent to which, if at all, the 
belief of a person threatening to make a publication in the media is relevant to the issue of 
public interest. After citing from the judgment of Eady J in Mosley v News Group Newspapers 
Limited and referring to the provisions of s32 of the Data Protection Act 1998, he observed 
that:238

“The  Data  Protection  Act  might  well  apply  to  a  newspaper  publication,  and  in 
particular to an online publication. If that Act did apply, it would be anomalous if 
the  public  interest  defence  under  Section  32  required  the  Court  to  have  regard  to 
the reasonable belief of the journalist, but that the same defence under the general 
law did not. I cannot decide that any reasonable belief on the part of a journalist or 
editor would be irrelevant without hearing argument for that proposition, if it is to 
be advanced.”

3.111  However,  the  position  was  set  out  in  more  robust  terms  in  Goodwin  v  NGN  Ltd  where 
Tugendhat J held that whilst newspaper editors have the final decision on what is of interest 
to the public: judges have the final decision what it is in the public interest to publish.239

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.112  The correct approach based on present authority is that in conducting the balancing exercise 
between Article 8 and Article 10 and determining the public interest in publication, the Court 
is the ultimate arbiter of the public interest in the proposed/actual publication. It is for the 
Court to conduct a detailed and focussed analysis of the public interest in the publication 
and not simply enquire as to whether the journalist or editor had a reasonable belief that 
the publication was in the public interest. However, this is not to say that the state of mind 
of the journalist or editor is necessarily irrelevant to the balancing exercise under stage 2. As 
set out below, the defendant’s motive is relevant to the strength of the Article 10 right: take 
the hypothetical case of a defendant making threats to publish, or blackmailing an individual. 
This may well weaken his or her Article 10 claim. In contrast, a defendant acting in good faith 
and in the reasonable belief that publication is in the public interest may well find himself in 
a stronger position as regards his or her Article 10 right.

Factors of relevance to the balancing exercise

3.113  Whilst not intended to be an exhaustive collection of the factors which may be relevant to the 
balancing exercise under stage 2, the following issues have been considered in the case law 
in undertaking the balancing exercise between Article 8 and Article 10.

Correcting false image

3.114  An example of the application of this principle can be identified in Ferdinand v MGN Ltd. 
Whilst Nicol J held in relation to a “kiss and tell” story about footballer Rio Ferdinand that 
the first stage test was satisfied, there was a public interest in publication on two grounds, 
one of which was to correct the “false image” created as a result of an interview given by the 
footballer in which he had portrayed himself as a family man and as a reformed character in a 
stable relationship. The Court held that while that perception of him continued to exist, there 
was a public interest in demonstrating that it was untrue. The judge acknowledged that it was 
an unattractive “kiss and paid for telling” story, but stated that:240

“stories  may  be  in  the  public  interest  even  if  the  reasons  behind  the  informant 
providing the information are less than noble”.

3.115  In McKennitt v Ash the Court of Appeal suggested that a very high degree of misbehaviour 
must be demonstrated in order to justify the disclosure of private information on the basis 
that the information tends to expose hypocrisy or correct a false image.241

Affects performance of obligations and duties

3.116  In Goodwin v NGN Limited and VBN it was argued that there was a public interest in exposing 
details of a relationship between Fred Goodwin and a senior employee of the Royal Bank of 
Scotland on the basis that it had an impact on the financial difficulties of the bank. Whilst 
this argument was rejected in the absence of evidence, Tugendhat J recognised that there 
may be circumstances where the private life of a person holding a responsible position so 
impacted on his or her ability to carry out their role that it would be in the public interest to 
report it.242 Any assertion that features of a persons’ private life have a detrimental effect on 
the performance of public duties will require proper evidence.

1886

APPENDICESComparative value of different sorts of speech

3.117  Baroness Hale confirmed in Campbell that there are different types of speech just as there 
different types of information, some of which are more deserving of protection in a democratic 
society than others. The courts will therefore be more likely to find in favour of the defendant 
where the publication relates to political speech rather than gossip.243

Debate relating to public figures

3.118  The case of Von Hannover v Germany is of particular importance in confirming that disclosure 
of information about public servants or officials is likely to contribute to a debate of general 
importance which will weigh heavily in the Article 8 and Article 10 balancing exercise.244 The 
Court held that “a fundamental distinction” had to be made between reporting facts capable 
of contributing to a debate in a democratic society relating to, for example, politicians in the 
exercise of their functions, and reporting details of the private life of an individual who, as 
in Princess Caroline’s case, does not exercise official functions. In the former case, the Press 
exercises its vital role of “watchdog”. In the latter case it does not perform that role, see para 
63. Accordingly:245

“…the decisive factor in balancing the protection of private life against freedom of 
expression should lie in the contribution that the published photos and articles make 
to a debate of general interest. It is clear in the instant case that they made no such 
contribution  since  the  Applicant  exercises  no  official  function  and  the  photos  and 
articles related exclusively to details of her private life.”

3.119  A different approach was taken in Axel Springer and Von Hannover (No.2) which confirmed 
that reports of the private lives of public figures will be acceptable where they contribute to 
a matter of general interest and there is no evidence of other wrongdoing. In both cases the 
fact that the individuals involved were not private individuals but could properly be regarded 
as “public figures” was important. In Axel Springer, the court found that the TV personality 
had himself revealed details about his private life in a number of interviews and in the court’s 
view had actively sought the limelight and was well known to the public. As a consequence, 
his legitimate expectation that his private life would be effectively protected was reduced.246 
In Von Hannover (No. 2), the court was satisfied that Princess Caroline and her husband were 
“undeniably very well known”, irrespective of the question of the extent to which the Princess 
assumes official functions on behalf of the Principality of Monaco.247

Defendant’s motives in threatening to publish private information

3.120  To date the court has regarded as a relevant factor the Defendant’s intentions in stating their 
intention to publish private information. Tugendhat J in AMM v HXW held that if a person is 
making unwarranted demands with threats to publish, that is a factor in deciding whether 
that person has any Article 10 rights, and, if so then the weight to be accorded to them in 
balancing them with the Applicant’s Article 8 rights.248

1887

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.121  In another privacy case, Sharp J took into account the defendant’s motives when balancing 
the claimant’s Article 8 and the defendant’s Article 10 rights when she observed in DFT v TFD 
that disclosure of the information in that case (whether to the media or generally) would 
be  the  fulfilment  of  a  blackmail  threat  and  that  the  expression  rights  of  blackmailers  are 
extremely weak, if they are engaged at all.249

3.122  It is unsurprising that the court will seek to inquire into the motives of the discloser, as this will 

likely go to the assessment of the strength and integrity of the argument of public interest.

Rights of another person to tell their story

3.123  In  McKennitt  v  Ash,  the  defendant,  Ms  Ash,  an  author  and  close  friend  of  Ms  McKennitt, 
sought  to  resist  the  order  for  injunctive  relief  on  the  basis  that  her  book  was  simply  an 
expression of her relationship with the claimant and the role she played in her life and it 
was therefore argued that it was her right to tell her own story. In rejecting this argument 
Eady J held, having regard to the decision in Von Hannover, that if a person wishes to reveal 
information  about  aspects  of  his  or  her  relations  with  other  people,  which  would  attract 
the  prima  facie  protection  of  privacy  rights,  any  such  revelation  should  be  crafted,  so  far 
as  possible,  to  protect  the  other  person’s  privacy.  He  emphasised  that  it  does  not  follow, 
because one can reveal one’s private life, that one can also expose confidential matters in 
respect of which others are entitled to protection if their consent is not forthcoming.250

Pre-notification requirement

3.124  Prior  notification  of  publication  can  properly  be  described  as  good  practice  but  is  not  a 
legal requirement. The law does not require advance notice of publication to be given to 
the subject of an article and a challenge to this before the ECtHR pursued by Max Mosley 
was unsuccessful. The Court noted that Article 10 does not prohibit the imposition of prior 
restraint on publication, any such restrains call for the most careful scrutiny although prior 
restraint  may  be  more  readily  justified  in  cases  which  demonstrate  no  pressing  need  for 
immediate publication and in which there is no obvious contribution to a debate of general 
public interest.251 However, the ECtHR held that Article 8 does not require a legal duty to be 
imposed on the press to notify the subject of a publication in advance in order to allow him 
the opportunity to seek an interim injunction and thus prevent publication of material which 
violated  his  right  to  respect  for  his  private  life.  This  conclusion  was  reached  on  the  basis 
that there was a risk of a chilling effect on the press, and doubts as to effectiveness of a pre-
notification requirement and the wide margin of appreciation in this area.252

Remedies for misuse of private information

3.125  There are three potential remedies for the tort of misuse of private information: an injunction, 

damages and a declaration.

249 [2010] EWHC 2335 (QB) at para 23 
250 This was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal, who emphasised the fact that the individual who wished to 
disclose private information about another had been in, and only possessed this information because of a (more than 
transient) relationship of confidence

1888

APPENDICESInjunctions

3.126  An injunction may be sought on an interim or final basis. An injunction is often the most 
effective  remedy  for  claimants  seeking  to  restrain  publication  of  personal  information  or 
pictures.

3.127  The Court has recognised that damages may not be an effective remedy in this context. The 

Court of Appeal in Douglas & Ors v Hello Ltd. & Ors held that:253

“The award of damages eventually made to the Douglases, although unassailable in 
principle, was not at a level which, when measured against the effect of refusing them 
an interlocutory injunction, can fairly be characterised as adequate or satisfactory. 
Only by the grant of an interlocutory injunction could the Douglases’ rights have been 
satisfactorily  protected.  Further,  the  interests  of  Hello!  at  the  interlocutory  stage, 
which were essentially only financial, could have been protected by an appropriate 
undertaking in damages by the Douglases”.

3.128  In Mosley v News Group Newspapers Ltd Eady J observed that:254

“whereas reputation can be vindicated by an award of damages, in the sense that 
the claimant can be restored to the esteem in which he was previously held, that is 
not possible where embarrassing personal information has been released for general 
publication”.

3.129  When an injunction is sought on an interim basis, the court will carefully scrutinise the basis 
for seeking to restrain publication. The burden for the applicant of establishing the need for 
restraining pre-publication is a heavy one. The court will consider, applying s12 of the HRA, 
whether the Claimant is likely to establish at trial that publication is an unlawful interference 
with their right to privacy and this process will require consideration of the principles set out 
in detail above.

3.130  The courts have repeatedly recognised the need for restraint in interfering with publication 

and the need for such interference to be justified.255

3.131  If a party proceeds to trial and is successful in establishing a cause of action in respect of the 
future publication or disclosure of information, the court may grant an injunction. Where 
a claimant has established his claim for misuse of private information at trial then, unless 
the grant of an injunction would be an exercise in futility because, for example, the private 
information is so widely in the public domain that there would be no point in restraining 
publication of it, he or she is very likely obtain an injunction restraining a defendant from 
further misuse.

3.132  In this area of the law that have recently been concerns regarding a number of procedural 
aspects of injunction, in particular the anonymity of claimants and publication of the mere 
fact of an injunction having been granted being prohibited, commonly referred to as a super 
injunction.

3.133  As  a  general  principle,  the  names  of  parties  to  an  action  are  included  in  the  orders  and 
judgments of the court. This is a corollary of the general rule that hearings are carried out in 
and judgments and orders are public and there is no general exception where cases concern

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsprivate matters: JIH v News Group Newspapers Ltd.256 Article 6 provides for a public hearing 
and for a judgment to be pronounced publicly, although this right is subject to the need to 
protect the private life of the parties, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the 
court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.

3.134  However, parties seeking an injunction to restrain publication often wish to preserve their 
anonymity to prevent further reporting of the circumstances giving rise to, and the claim for, 
an injunction.

3.135  The Court has jurisdiction to make an order for anonymity in accordance with section 11 of 
the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and CPR 39.2(4). Such an order is often sought together with 
a substantive injunction seeking, (a) the protection of private information and, (b) prevention 
of publicity concerning the existence of the proceedings and the claimant’s interest in them 
(sought  on  the  basis  that  to  allow  such  publicity  would  encourage  speculation  about  the 
subject matter of the action, which would be intrusive in itself and may well alight on the very 
class of secret which exists). If anonymity is not ordered, the fact that the claimant has had to 
seek relief against the defendants may become a story in its own right.

3.136  Derogations from the general principle of open justice can only be justified in exceptional 
circumstances. However, it is fair to observe that by 2010 claimants were frequently seeking 
interim injunctions against the media which had some or most or all of the following features: 
the  applications  were  heard  in  private,  the  proceedings  were  brought  in  an  anonymised 
form,  there  was  no  public  judgment,  they  were  sought  without  notice  to  anyone  (for 
example, because the defendants were “persons unknown”, or because the defendant media 
organisation was thought to be likely to frustrate the order if given notice), and the injunctions 
were served on media third parties with the intention of binding them in accordance with the 
“Spycatcher” principle.

3.137  Claimants  often  sought  such  orders  on  the  grounds  that  if  they  were  not  granted  these 
procedural protections they would be deterred from seeking any relief at all. Prior to the 
decision  in  Terry,  such  arguments  tended  to  be  successful.257  However,  the  Terry  decision 
marked an important check on the growing practice of the courts to entertain proceedings 
effectively shrouded in secrecy. Tugendhat J emphasised that these protections were only to 
be granted if necessary and a number of subsequent cases made clear that public judgment 
would be required, even if some material facts were omitted from the judgment and set out 
in a confidential schedule attached to the order. The concerns raised by Tugendhat J in Terry 
fed into the Report of the Committee on Super-Injunctions at para 2.35258:

“It  is  true  that,  until  early  2010,  there  were  justifiable  concerns  that  a  form  of 
permanent secret justice was beginning to develop. However, that concern should be 
dispelled by the decision in the Terry case.”

3.138  Another feature of the practice in relation to obtaining injunctions which gave rise to legitimate 
concern  was  that  interim  injunctions  were  kept  in  place  for  long  periods  and  potentially 
indefinitely, either because the initial orders granting interim relief did not contain a return 
date or because the substantive claims were not progressed by the claimant towards trial, in 
many cases because for a claimant once an interim injunction was granted no better result 
could be achieved at full trial and for the defendant the grant of an injunction on an interim 
basis was effectively determinative of the issue as the story may not be worth publishing

APPENDICESmonths later. In Giggs v News Group Newspapers Ltd Tugendhat J noted the incentive for 
claimants  to  abuse  the  process,  to  avoid  the  need  to  prove  their  cases  at  trial.259  Having 
obtained an interim non-disclosure order it may appear to be in interests of the claimant to 
hold on to it as long as possible and to proceed to trial as slowly as possible, if at all.260

3.139  During this period the media expressed concern against orders, in particular, super injunctions, 
which restrain a person from: publishing information which relates to the applicant and is 
said to be confidential or private, and, publicising or informing others of the existence of the 
order and the proceedings.

3.140  The Committee on Super-Injunctions chaired by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Neuberger, was 
set up in April 2010 in response to these concerns and the Report dated 20 May 2011 and 
accompanying “Practice Guidance: Interim Non-Disclosure Orders” issued by Lord Neuberger 
MR  with  effect  from  1  August  2011  entrenched  the  developments  towards  open  justice 
recognised in the case law and emphasised free speech and open justice.261

Damages

3.141  Where a claim for misuse of personal information is successful the claimant is likely to be 
compensated for any non pecuniary losses by an award of damages and the courts have tended 
to award damages for distress, hurt feelings and loss of dignity in privacy cases. Initially these 
awards have tended to be in the region of £2,000 – £10,000, with the Mosley case signalling 
a departure from these lower sums to an award of £60,000. In Cooper v Turrell Tugendhat 
J accepted the submission that the measure of damages in Mosley, in which the court took 
into account sums awarded in defamation cases, was the more appropriate guide to take 
than awards in earlier cases.262 There are a number of reported settlements in the region of 
£30,000. In determining quantum the Court will have regard to all the circumstances of the 
unlawful disclosures that are relevant, including the seriousness and scale of the intrusion, 
the circumstances in which the information was obtained and the defendant’s knowledge at 
to potential harm to the claimant. Particularly intrusive disclosure, for example photographs, 
may affect the severity of the conduct. The claimant’s own conduct will also be scrutinised 
for the purposes of assessing damages and to the extent that the claimant’s conduct has 
contributed to the nature and scale of the distress this is likely to be material.

3.142  Aggravated  damages  have  been  awarded  in  some  privacy  cases.  For  example,  £1,000 
aggravated damages were awarded in Campbell v MGN on the basis of the post-publication 
conduct  of  the  newspapers.  Whilst  there  had  been  some  judicial  movement  towards 
recognising a claim for exemplary damages in this context, it has now been established that 
exemplary  damages  are  not  awardable  in  claims  for  misuse  of  private  information,  until 
such a course is sanctioned by Parliament or the Supreme Court. 263 In Mosley v NGN Eady 
J adopted a restrictive approach to the extension of exemplary damage, holding that it was 
not clear that misuse of private information was a tort to which the possibility of exemplary 
damages should necessarily extend.

Appendix 4 | Legal MaterialsProtection from Harassment Act 1997

3.143  The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (PHA) has potential application both to the conduct 
of journalists, for example news-gathering activities by journalists and photographers, and 
also in relation to the actual content of publications.

3.144  The PHA provides that a person must not pursue “a course of conduct” which amounts to 
harassment of another and which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of that 
other.264 A person “ought to know” conduct amounts to harassment if a reasonable person 
in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct amounted to or 
involved harassment of the other.265 A course of conduct must involve conduct on at least 
two occasions.266

3.145  “Harassment” is not exhaustively defined in the Act, although the Act provides that harassment 
includes alarming another person or causing that person distress.267 However, the Act does 
not require alarm or distress to be caused; harassment may be demonstrated by other means, 
for example, the use by the press of offensive or insulting words about a person’s appearance 
or repeated mocking by a newspaper of a person’s sexual orientation, or in relation to other 
characteristics protected by the Equality Act 2010. The lack of an exhaustive definition of 
harassment gives the courts scope to interpret the Act so as to give effect to the rights under 
Article 8 and Article 10 of the ECHR.268

3.146  Section 1(3) sets out the defences to a claim for harassment, and these include that the course 
of conduct was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, was pursued under 
any enactment or rule of law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by 
any person under any enactment, or in the particular circumstances the pursuit of the course 
of conduct was reasonable. In the context of the press seeking to rely on a reasonableness 
defence it has been held that the defence:269

“requires the publisher to consider whether a proposed series of articles, which is 
likely to cause distress to an individual, will constitute an abuse of the freedom of press 
which the pressing social needs of a democratic society require should be curbed”.

3.147  Section  2  of  the  PHA  provides  that  the  course  of  conduct  pursued  in  breach  of  section  1 
will be a criminal offence. This is discussed in more detail at paragraph 4.129 of the Annex. 
Section 3 provides that an actual or apprehended breach of section 1 may be the subject of a 
claim in civil proceedings by the person who is or may be the victim of the course of conduct 
in question. This has the effect that a civil claim can be brought to restrain an apprehended 
breach of section 1, by way of an injunction; or a claim can be brought after the conduct has 
occurred to seek damages for (among other things) any anxiety caused by the harassment and 
any financial loss resulting from the harassment.270 If a court grants an injunction restraining a 
person from pursuing any conduct which amounts to harassment and the claimant considers 
that the defendant has breached the injunction, he or she may apply for the issue of a warrant 
for the arrest of the defendant.271

APPENDICES3.148  A limited number of claims have been brought against the press under the PHA on the basis 
that actual publication amounts to harassment, although the case law thus far suggest that 
claimants  have  enjoyed  limited  success  in  relation  to  claims  that  publication  amounts  to 
harassment.

3.149  The principle of such a claim being brought was first addressed in Thomas v News Group 
Newspapers Ltd in which News Group sought to strike out (as being unarguable) a claim for 
harassment based upon the publication of a series of articles in which the claimant, described 
as a “black clerk” was criticised for her involvement in a dispute over a racist comment at her 
place of work, and hate mail was subsequently received by the claimant in response to the 
article (the newspaper having published the claimant’s name and address). The court stated 
that:272

“In general, press criticism, even if robust, does not constitute unreasonable conduct 
and does not fall within the natural meaning of harassment”.

However, the Court of Appeal held that it was at least arguable that it was foreseeable that 
the publication of the articles complained of would lead Sun readers to address hostile letters 
to the claimant, causing her additional distress.

3.150  Recently,  in  Trimingham  v  Associated  Newspapers  Limited  the  claimant,  who  had  worked 
with and had an extra-marital affair with a well known politician, pursued a claim under the 
PHA.273 The basis of the claim was that the newspaper had engaged in a course of conduct 
which included publication of comments about the claimant’s personal appearance as well 
as  her  sexuality,  which  she  regarded  as  offensive,  both  in  the  articles  complained  of  and 
in  the  readers’  comments.  The  claimant  sought  damages,  including  aggravated  damages, 
and an injunction against the newspaper ordering them to refrain from further publication 
which  made  reference  to  the  claimant’s  sexual  orientation  unless  relevant  in  a  particular 
context distinct from her relationship with the politician and that the newspaper refrain from 
harassing the claimant.

3.151  Tugendhat  J  outlined  that  the  correct  approach  was  for  the  court  to  ask  the  following 
questions: (1) was the distress that the claimant suffered the result of the course of conduct, 
in  the  form  of  speech?  (2)  if  so,  ought  the  defendant  to  have  known  that  that  course  of 
conduct amounted to harassment? (3) if so, has the defendant shown that the pursuit of that 
course of conduct was reasonable? To both questions (1) and (2) the Court noted there are 
subsidiary questions: namely was the claimant a purely private figure or not and, either way, 
was she in other respects a person with a personality known to the defendant such that it 
ought not to have known that the course of conduct amounted to harassment?

3.152  Tugendhat J also set out guidance in relation to the interpretation of a course of conduct 
consisting of speech which is alleged to be pejorative of a claimant: he did so by adopting the 
guidance provided by the Court of Appeal in Jeynes v News Magazines Ltd dealing with the 
meaning of words alleged to be defamatory:274

“The governing principles relevant to meaning … may be summarised in this way: (1) 
The governing principle is reasonableness. (2) The hypothetical reasonable [person] is 
not naïve but he is not unduly suspicious. He can read between the lines. He can read 
in an implication more readily than a lawyer and may indulge in a certain amount of 

272 [2001] EWCA Civ 1233 at para 34 
273 [2012] EWHC 1296 (QB). As set out above, there is an appeal pending against this decision by the Claimant 
274 [2008] EWCA Civ 130 

1893

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsloose thinking but he must be treated as being a man who is not avid for scandal and 
someone who does not, and should not, select one bad meaning where other non-
[pejorative] meanings are available. (3) Over-elaborate analysis is best avoided… (5) 
The article must be read as a whole, ...”

3.153  In relation to the defence of reasonableness, Tugendhat J noted in interpreting the decision 

in Thomas that:

“for the court to comply with HRA s.3, it must hold that a course of conduct in the 
form of journalistic speech is reasonable under PHA s.1(3)(c) unless, in the particular 
circumstances of the case, the course of conduct is so unreasonable that it is necessary 
(in the sense of a pressing social need) and proportionate to prohibit or sanction the 
speech in pursuit of one of the aims listed in Art 10(2), including, in particular, for the 
protection of the rights of others under Art 8.”

3.154  Although the decision is subject to challenge in the Court of Appeal, in Trimingham a narrow 
view  was  taken  of  the  meaning  of  a  private  individual;  and  the  Court  concluded  that  the 
claimant was not a private person by reason of the fact that: 1) in her professional capacity 
she undertook to work for one of leading politicians in country, and 2) in her private capacity 
she conducted a sexual relationship with a politician which would lead to him leaving his 
wife. Ultimately, the Judge accepted that whilst the claimant was upset about the insulting 
and offensive language about her appearance, he did not accept that the defendant ought 
to have known that its conduct in relation to that language would be sufficiently distressing 
to be considered oppressive or amount to harassment and he did not accept that in fact it 
was so considered by the claimant.275 The Court found that discussion or criticism of sexual 
relations which arise within a pre-existing professional relationship, or of sexual relationships 
which  involve  the  deception  of  a  spouse,  or  a  civil  partner,  or  of  others  with  a  right  not 
to be deceived, are matters which a reasonable person would not think would be conduct 
amounting  to  harassment,  and  would  think  was  reasonable,  unless  there  are  some  other 
circumstances which make it unreasonable. One circumstance which may make such a course 
of conduct unreasonable is if it interferes with the Article 8 rights of the claimant. However 
the Judge found that the claimant’s Article 8 rights had become very limited because she was 
not a purely private figure.

3.155  The  Trimingham  decision  illustrates  the  approach  that  will  be  adopted  by  the  courts  in 
assessing whether the publication of an article amounts to harassment. It appears that a key 
hurdle for any claimant is the need to establish that the journalist would have known that 
the course of conduct amounted to harassment, which appears from the decision to be a 
relatively high hurdle.

3.156  In  addition  to  the  content  of  publications,  methods  of  news  gathering  may  also  amount 
to harassment. For example, there are a number of cases where interim injunctions have 
been granted against journalists and photographers to prohibit them from door stepping, or 
besetting the home of a person they wished to photograph or interview. In AM v News Group 
Newspapers Ltd & Ors an application for an injunction was made by a person who had become 
subject to media interest solely by reason of the fact that he was the landlord of a property 
rented by the cleric Abu Qatada.276 The applicant’s home had been visited by journalists who 
were calling his phone, knocking at his door, and taking photographs of him when he went 
outside. His children could not go outside. Tugendhat J noted that Article 8 of the ECHR and 
s.6 of the HRA require measures to be put in place to ensure respect for a person’s home 

275 At para 254

APPENDICESand family life, and therefore made an order imposing publishing restrictions prohibiting the 
publishing  or  broadcasting  of:  the  claimant’s  name  and  address;  or  any  photograph,  film, 
video or image that identified the claimant’s address or showed any occupier or invitee within 
the house or garden of the claimant’s address; and also imposed a restraint on harassment 
in relation to the contacting the claimant or approaching the claimant’s address.277 The Judge 
noted that the order, in so far as it prohibited disclosure of information, was made with a 
view to preventing interference with the right to respect of one’s home and family and not to 
preventing disclosure of information which is sensitive.

3.157  Another example is the case of Ting Lan Hong and KLM v Persons Unknown where Tugendhat 
J granted an injunction prohibiting harassment of the mother of the child of actor Hugh Grant, 
following prolonged harassing conduct from photographers.278 The Court noted that Ms Hong 
had received numerous calls and messages from journalists, had been regularly followed and 
photographed without her consent when pregnant, had photographers outside her home 
every day for a period, and that photographers persisted in attending at her property despite 
a warning from the PCC to desist from such conduct. The order was granted prohibiting the 
harassment of the claimant.

3.158  These two cases are illustrative of the utility of the PHA in seeking to restrain the conduct 
of  journalists  and  photographers  where  their  conduct  amounts  to  harassment  within  the 
meaning  of  the  Act.  It  seems  likely  that  where  an  individual  is  faced  on  more  than  one 
occasion with a number of journalists or photographers present at their home, telephoning 
or  attempting  to  communicate  with  them  in  circumstances  where  distress  and  alarm  is 
caused, this is likely to justify the grant of an injunction requiring the ceasing of such conduct, 
provided the relevant threshold of severity is established.

Defamation

3.159  In  broad  terms,  the  law  of  defamation  protects  a  person’s  reputation.  Unlike  misuse  of 
private information, defamation is not concerned with protecting a person from publication 
of private information but protects a person from the publication of untruths which have the 
effect of damaging their reputation.

3.160  The  principles  of  the  law  of  defamation  are  mostly  contained  in  the  common  law  with 
some overlay of statutory provisions, namely the Defamation Acts 1952 and 1996. The law 
is currently the subject of debate and likely reform. The Defamation Bill was presented to 
Parliament on 10 May 2012 and seeks to clarify and reform aspects of the law of defamation.

3.161  There  are  two  varieties  of  each  of  the  torts  of  libel  and  slander:  personal  defamation, 
where there are imputations as to the attributes or character of an individual; and business 
or professional defamation, where the imputation goes to an attribute of an individual, a 
business,  or  a  charity,  and  that  imputation  is  as  to  the  way  the  profession  or  business  is 
conducted.  These  varieties  are  not  mutually  exclusive:  the  same  words  may  carry  both 
varieties of imputation.

3.162  A  person  or  organisation  may  bring  a  claim  for  defamation  where  they  can  be  identified 
from the publication, for example by name or by their title, or where the material would 
lead people acquainted with the person to believe that he or she was the person referred 

277 in any newspaper, magazine, public computer network, interest website, sound or television broadcast or cable or 
satellite programme 
278 [2011] EWHC 2995 (QB) 

1895

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsto. There is no statutory definition of what is defamatory, however the test adopted by the 
courts is whether a statement “lowers a person in the estimation of right-thinking members 
of society generally”.279 Whether the words in fact convey a defamatory meaning is a question 
of fact applying the standard of the ordinary reasonable person.

3.163  The principles applied in determining the meaning of the words were summarised in Jeynes 
v  News  Magazines  Ltd  (to  which  reference  is  made  above)  where  Sir  Anthony  Clarke  MR 
identified principles which bear repetition: (1) the governing principle is reasonableness; (2) 
the hypothetical reasonable reader is not naïve but he is not unduly suspicious, he can read 
between the lines, he can read in an implication more readily than a lawyer and may indulge 
in a certain amount of loose thinking but he must be treated as being a man who is not avid 
for scandal and someone who does not, and should not, select one bad meaning where other 
non-defamatory meanings are available; (3) over-elaborate analysis is best avoided; (4) the 
intention of the publisher is irrelevant; (5) the article must be read as a whole, and any “bane 
and antidote” taken together; (6) the hypothetical reader is taken to be representative of 
those who would read the publication in question; (7) in delimiting the range of permissible 
defamatory meanings, the court should rule out any meaning which, “can only emerge as 
the produce of some strained, or forced, or utterly unreasonable interpretation”; (8) it follows 
that “it is not enough to say that by some person or another, the words might be understood 
in a defamatory sense”.280

3.164  There was previously some uncertainty as to whether the existing law imposes a “seriousness 
threshold”, although the recent case of Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Limited surveyed 
the authorities and concluded that defamation must include a qualification or threshold of 
seriousness, so as to exclude trivial claims.281

3.165  As a general principle the claimant will need to establish that the material has been read, 
heard or seen by at least one other person and in some circumstances the courts may be 
prepared to draw an inference that material has been widely published in the absence of 
concrete evidence of receipt of the information by others, for example, where information is 
generally accessible (for example on the website of a mainstream newspaper).

3.166  The  extent  of  publication  is  important,  as  proceedings  may  be  stayed  on  the  basis  that 
where publication is very limited, the cost of proceedings may be disproportionate to the 
likely benefit in the event the claimant succeeds: see for example Jameel v Dow Jones & Co 
Inc.282 It was recently observed by Tugendhat J that recent cases demonstrate that each of 
the three judges who are currently hearing most of the defamation cases are applying the 
principle  of  Jameel  v  Dow  Jones  with  some  frequency,  and  in  a  number  of  different,  but 
related, contexts in defamation actions.283

3.167  Each  separate  publication  of  a  statement  (or  re-publication)  may  give  rise  to  a  cause  of 
action.  For  example,  each  transmission  of  a  television  or  radio  broadcast,  and  each  copy 
of  a  newspaper  sold  is  a  separate  publication.  This  issue  is  mainly  of  significant  where 
some publications would otherwise be statute barred and in cases where publications are 
in different jurisdictions and where common law qualified privilege is a defence.284 Further

284 The rule is not applied in assessing damages and is usually not applied in determining meaning, where the single 
meaning rule is applied 

1896

APPENDICESpublication by a different party of the same material may also give rise to a cause of action, 
this being known as the “repetition rule”.285 In some circumstances the original publisher will 
be liable for the subsequent re-publication if this was both caused by the original publication 
and  a  foreseeable  consequence.286  Some  concern  has  been  expressed  whether  this  rule 
should be of equal application to the Internet, however the courts have to date rejected a 
“single publication” rule and held, for example, that each separate bulletin board posting, 
or display of content of a web page (for as long as that web page remains accessible) gives 
rise to a cause of action. 287 Publication will occur where a person intentionally or negligently 
takes part in, or authorises, the communication of material. Each person who publishes the 
defamatory  material  is  in  principle  liable.  Liability  will  not  ordinarily  attach  to  accidental 
publication of defamatory material.288

Defences

3.168  There are a number of defences available to publishers of defamatory material, including 
defences of justification, fair comment, absolute privilege, qualified privilege and innocent 
dissemination. These are considered below.

3.169  A  defence  of  justification  will  be  open  to  a  publisher  where  the  defamatory  statement  is 
substantially true.289 This must be proven on the balance of probabilities and is an objective 
test: it is not sufficient for a publisher to show that they genuinely believed the statement 
was true.

3.170  A defence of fair comment protects expressions of opinion or comments (as distinction from 
assertions of fact), where the comment relates to a matter of public interest, the comment is 
based on facts which are true or absolutely privileged and the comment is fair.290

3.171  In certain limited circumstances the law recognises that defamatory statements will be immune 
from challenge, even where no other defence applies. These exceptions, known as absolute 
privilege, include statements made in the House by Members of Parliament,291 statements 
made in the course of judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings by the judge, counsel, parties, 
witnesses and jurors,292 and statements made to the police and investigatory agencies in the 
course of an inquiry into illegality or wrongdoing.293 Fair and accurate reports of proceedings 
before various courts attract absolute privilege if published contemporaneously.294

3.172  The law also recognises certain forms of qualified privilege where publication of defamatory 
statements attract privilege if the statement was made in the performance of a legal, social 
or  moral  duty  or  to  protect  an  interest  and  the  statement  was  made  to  a  person  with  a

288 Exceptionally where the defendant should reasonably have anticipated publication as a consequence of their 
conduct they will be unable to rely on the accidental nature of the publication itself

290 Referred to in Spiller v Joseph [2010] UKSC 53 as “honest comment”. The Supreme Court held that the comment 
must explicitly or implicitly indicate at least in general terms the facts on which it is based. See also s6 of the 
Defamation Act 1952

1897

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialscorresponding duty or interest in receiving that material.295 One aspect of qualified privilege 
of particular relevance is the application of the duty and interest argument to publication 
of material in the public interest, as articulated by the House of Lords in Reynolds v Times 
Newspapers Ltd.296

3.173  The  defence  of  Reynolds  privilege  has  recently  been  comprehensively  analysed  by  the 
Supreme Court in Flood v Times Newspapers Limited.297 This defence will protect publication 
of a defamatory matter where i) it is in the public interest that the information should be 
published and ii) the publisher has acted responsibly in publishing information.298 This defence 
is accurately described as a public interest defence.299

3.174  In respect of the first element, the courts have recognised that this is not a black and white 
test, but rather it is necessary to consider “the extent to which the subject matter is a matter 
of public concern”. The publisher must show that the publication was in the public interest, 
and this must go further than merely showing that the subject matter was of public interest.300 
The test adopted by Lady Hale in Jameel that “there must be some real public  interest in 
having this information in the public domain” was supported by Lord Phillips in Flood.301 The 
Reynolds privilege requires a balancing exercise between the importance of the public interest 
in receiving the relevant information and the public interest in preventing the dissemination 
of defamatory allegations with the injury to reputation that results.302 Ultimately each case 
will turn on its own facts, however the seriousness of the allegation is a significant factor 
in  assessing  where  the  balance  should  be  struck  between  the  public  interest  in  receiving 
information and the potential harm caused if an individual is defamed.303 In respect of the 
public interest in publishing allegations made and being investigated against a senior police 
officer, the Supreme Court placed weight on the fact that the publication was with a view 
to ensuring that the allegations were properly investigated by the police in circumstances 
where the journalist had reason to believe they were not being so investigated.304 Lord Mance 
explained that journalistic judgement carried weight in considering how much detail should 
be published, although any journalist must carefully consider the public interest in publishing 
allegations that have not been fully investigated or their accuracy determined.305

3.175  In Flood the Supreme Court addressed the extent of verification required before a journalist 
can rely on the defence. The Court emphasised that the privilege will attach only if the journalist 
has acted honestly and reasonably believed the published facts to be true, although no hard 
and fast principles can be applied. Where a journalist alleges there are grounds for suspecting 
a  person  to  be  guilty  of  misconduct  the  responsible  journalist  should  satisfy  himself  that 
grounds for suspicion exist (these can be derived from reliable sources or inferred from the 
fact of a police investigation), but he need not know what the grounds are.306

295 See also Schedule 1 to the Defamation Act 1996, which contains a table of reports and statements which are 
protected by qualified privilege, the privilege being defeated if it is shown that the publication was malicious and 
without the need to demonstrate corresponding duties and interests

1898

APPENDICES3.176  The law also recognises, through common law and statute, a defence of innocent dissemination. 
Section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 sets out a defence for a person who was not the author, 
editor or publisher of the statement, who took reasonable care in relation to the publication 
of the statement and did not know and had no reason to believe, that what he did caused or 
contributed to the publication of a defamatory statement. The common law defence protects 
defendants who did not know a publication contained a libel, or that the publication was of 
such a character that it was likely to contain a libel and the absence of such knowledge was 
not by reason of negligence.307

Remedies

3.177  Whilst the primary objective for persons upon being defamed (or threatened with defamation) 
is to restrain publication, it is only in exceptional circumstances that the court will be content 
to grant an interim injunction restraining publication. Interim relief will be refused if the there 
is any proper basis for a believing a defence will be successful or that the claimant is only 
likely to recover nominal damages. Section 12 of the HRA will apply to an interim injunction 
sought in defamation claims and it has been held that nothing in this section weakens the 
common  law  rule  that  interim  relief  will  only  be  granted  if  the  material  complained  of  is 
so clearly actionable that if a jury were to find for the defendant an appeal court would be 
obliged to set aside the jury’s conclusion as unreasonable.308

3.178  Where a claimant is successful in a defamation trial, a permanent injunction restraining the 
defendant from further publication of the defamatory material will be granted if it can be 
established that future publication is likely and would constitute an actionable wrong.

3.179  The principal mechanism for vindicating damage to reputation is an award of damages. The 
law presumes that a defamatory publication has damaged the reputation of the claimant. 
Compensatory damages are awarded to compensate the damage to reputation and include 
damages for monetary loss occasioned by the attitude adopted by other persons towards 
the claimant (special damages) and damages for distress, hurt and humiliation. Aggravated 
damages may be awarded where the conduct of the defendant has increased the claimant’s 
injury or where the defendant has acted improperly. Exemplary damages may be awarded 
in  some  cases  to  punish  the  defendant  for  particularly  disgraceful  conduct  and  where 
compensatory damages are inadequate in all the circumstances. A defendant who has given 
an apology prior to the commencement of the action may be able to mitigate the extent of 
an award of damages.

Application of the law of defamation to the internet

3.180  In  an  era  where  the  internet  has  displaced  nearly  every  other  form  of  communication  in 
terms of its scope, use and geographical reach, the extent to which claims of defamation can 
be pursued against statements published on the internet is a pressing concern. The internet 
facilitates the communication of information and opinion to a global audience of billions of 
people on an instantaneous basis. Freedom of expression demands that regulation should 
not interfere with the potential of this source of information, however the internet poses a 
significance potential for abuse and unregulated activity, including defamatory statements, 
to be widely published.

307 See for example Goldsmith v Sperrings Ltd [1977] 1 WLR 478 
308 Commonly known as the rule in Bonnard v Perryman [1891] 2 Ch 269. The relationship between this rule and s12 of 
the HRA 1998 was addressed by the Court of Appeal in Greene v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2005] QB 972 

1899

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials3.181  The desirability and practicality of regulating internet content is a hotly contested subject and 
the existing legal position is complex, both as a result of the fact that there is no comprehensive 
framework at a domestic level which establishes a mechanism for regulation of the internet 
and secondly because of the extent to which the courts have tried, not always successfully, to 
apply the traditional principles of defamation to the Internet.

3.182  The distinction between libel and slander is not straightforward in the context of the internet, 
where  the  medium  through  which  the  information  is  published  may  resemble  television 
programmes (with video), radio programmes (with audio), or notice-boards or text akin to 
newspaper articles. In short, the internet may involve transient or permanent publication 
and may comprise spoken and/or written word. Section 166(1) of the Broadcasting Act 1990 
has the effect of deeming a number of internet communications and internet services to be 
published in permanent form, and this is actionable as libel.309

3.183  Websites that host user generated content pose a particular difficulty in this context. The 
general position appeared to be that the websites were to be regarded as publishers of the 
material posted on their websites, although they would not be liable for the initial publication 
if they did not participate in the publication (for example by editing or approving the post). 
However, upon notice of a complaint as to the content of a post, if steps were not taken to 
remove the content, liability could be established, subject to defences, for example section 
1(1) of the Defamation Act 1996 and Regulation 19 of the Electronic Commerce Regulations 
2002.310 The notice given to the website must disclose the facts or circumstances which form 
the  basis  of  the  allegation.311  In  Davison  v  Habeeb,  the  court  determined  that  Google,  as 
host of Blogger.com, was arguably a publisher under the common law of content hosted on 
the blog and that liability would follow notification of a complaint.312 However, the recent 
decision of Tamiz v Google casts some doubt on this approach.313 Eady J found that Google 
Inc was not a publisher even when on notice as to the offending blogs, even though it had 
the technical capabilities to take down the post. Google was not a publisher within the well 
recognised common law principles of defamation as its role as a platform provider was a 
purely passive one.314

309 s166(1) of the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that for the purposes of the law of libel, the publication of words in 
the course of any programme included in a programme service shall be treated as publication in a permanent form. This 
applies where material published via the Internet amounts to “the publication of words in the course of any programme 
included  in  a  programme  service”.  ‘Programme’  is  defined  in  s202(1)  and  ‘programme  service’  is  defined  in  s201(1) 
as including a programme service within the meaning of the Communications Act 2003. S23 of the 2003 Act defines 
‘electronic communications network’ as a transmission system for the conveyance, by the use of electrical, magnetic, or 
electro-magnetic energy, of signals of any description, which includes Internet communications 
310 See for example Godfrey v Demon Internet Limited [2000] 3 WLR 1020 where the Court held that every time one 
of the defendant’s customers accessed the newsgroup in question and saw the posting defamatory of the plaintiff, 
there was a publication to that customer. Further, in seeking to rely on the defence provided by s1 of the Defamation 
Act 1996 the difficulty facing the website was that s1(1)(b) required the defendant to take reasonable care in relation 
to the publication of the statement and s1(1)(c) required the defendant to show that “he did not know, and had no 
reason to believe, that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of a defamatory statement”. However, 
once the defendant knew of the defamatory posting (because the claimant complained about the posting) but chose 
not remove it from its Usenet news-servers, it could not avail itself of the defence provided by s1. These implement in 
the law of the United Kingdom the provisions of Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of 
the Council dated 8 June 2000 relating to electronic commerce
311 See the statements of HHJ Moloney in McGrath v Amazon, Eady J in Bunt v Tilley [2006] EWHC 407 (QB) and HHJ 
Parkes QC in Davidson v Habeeb [2011] EWHC 3031 
312 [2011] EWHC 3031 
313 [2012] EWHC 449 (QB) 
314 Mr Tamiz’s claim for defamation therefore failed. Eady J went on to consider s1 of the Defamation Act 1996 and 
concluded  that a defence would  be viable  on  this  basis.  He also  concluded  that an  alternative defence based  upon 
Regulation  19  of  the  Electronic  Commerce  (EC  Directive)  Regulations  2002  would  exempt  Google  from  liability  for 
defamation.  Permission  to  appeal  has  been  granted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  the  appeal  is  listed  to  be  heard  in 
December 2012

APPENDICES3.184  The  Electronic  Commerce  Regulations  set  out  the  circumstances  in  which  Internet 
intermediaries are responsible for material which is not created by them, but which is hosted, 
cached  or  carried  by  them.315  The  Regulations  draw  a  distinction  between  intermediaries 
who are mere conduits (regulation 17), who cache information (regulation 18), and who host 
information (regulation 19). Regulation 19 provides a defence where the service provider does 
not have actual knowledge of unlawful information or is not aware of facts and circumstances 
from which it would have been apparent to the service provider that the information hosted 
was unlawful.316 Section 1(1) of the Defamation Act 1996 is regularly invoked by websites 
as a defence on the basis that they are not the author, editor or commercial publisher of a 
statement.

3.185  The courts have struggled to apply traditional defamation principles to the internet and the 
case law has thrown up a number of interesting issues of unique application to the internet. 
For example, a special feature of chatrooms, message boards or blogs is that the text can 
continually  evolve  with  new  comments  being  added  which  may  affect  the  context  and 
meaning of previous and subsequent post. It has been decided that the final thread must 
be treated as a single publication for the exercise of determining meaning.317 Further, the 
meaning of the words must be considered in light of the purpose and role of chat rooms and 
message boards, where casual, emotive and imprecise speech are all common features. As 
Eady J explained in Smith v ADVFN people who participate in bulletin boards expect a certain 
amount of repartee or give and take.318, 319

3.186  The application of the defamation principles to the internet remains an area of considerable 
uncertainty. Whilst the courts have attempted to fashion principles that are workable in the 
short term, the law in this area is far from clear and this has given rise to conflicting decisions. 
Other jurisdictions have similarly struggled to grasp the complexities of the operation of the 
internet and recognised the need for the courts to view libel allegations within the unique 
context of the internet. A comprehensive framework of coherent rules and regulation remains 
lacking and it is likely that the law will be subject to further development in this area.

Defamation Bill

3.187  The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the law of defamation, including codification 
of matters which have been established in case law as well as proposing some changes to the 
existing law. The key features of the Bill in its present form can be summarised as follows.320

3.188  Clause 1 provides that a statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is 
likely to cause serious harm to reputation. This clause builds upon recognition by the courts 
that there is a threshold of seriousness and sets a relatively high bar for bringing a claim.

3.189  The  Bill  also  includes  a  number  of  provisions  that  operate  as  defences  to  a  claim  for 
defamation, codifying much of the common law with some amendments. Clause 2 abolishes 
the common law defence of justification to provide for a statutory defence of truth, namely 
a defence where the statement complained of its substantially true. Clause 3 abolishes the 
common law defence of fair comment and provides for a defence of honest opinion which

either  generally  or  specifically,  the  basis  of  the  opinion,  and  iii)  an  honest  person  could 
have held the opinion on the basis of any fact which existed at the time the statement was 
published or anything asserted to be a fact in a privileged statement published before the 
statement complained of.321 Clause 3(6) contemplates the scenario where the defendant is 
not the author of the statement (i.e. the defendant is the newspaper title, and the statement 
of opinion is written by a particular journalist), and provides that the defence is not available 
if the defendant knew or ought to have known the author did not hold the opinion that the 
statement was based on the relevant facts. There is no requirement for the opinion to be held 
on a matter of public interest.

3.190  Clause  4  abolishes  the  common  law  defence  known  as  Reynolds  privilege  and  sets  out 
a  defence  of  “responsible  publication  on  matters  of  public  interest”  which  is  intended 
to  broadly  reflect  the  current  law.  The  defence  applies  to  statements  of  fact  and  opinion 
and  has  two  components;  namely  that  the  statement  complained  of  was  or  formed  part 
of a statement on a matter of public interest, and that the defendant acted responsibly in 
publishing the statement. Clause 4(2) sets out the matters to which the court may have regard 
in determining whether the defendant acted responsibly. These factors, which are illustrative 
and  not  exhaustive, broadly  reflect the  current  case  law  and  include  a)  the  nature of  the 
publication and its context, b) the seriousness of the imputation conveyed by the statement, 
c) the relevance of the imputation conveyed by the statement to the matter of public interest 
concerned, d) the importance of the matter of public interest concerned, e) the information 
the defendant had before publishing the statement and what the defendant knew about the 
reliability of that information, f) whether the defendant sought the claimant’s views on the 
statement before publishing it and whether an account of any views the claimant expressed 
was published with the statement, g) whether the defendant took any other steps to verify 
the  truth  of  the  imputation  conveyed  by  the  statement,  h)  the  timing  of  the  statement’s 
publication, and i) the tone of the statement. Clauses 4(3) and (4) reproduce the common 
law  doctrine  of  “reportage”,  namely  where  allegations  are  reported  neutrally  rather  than 
adopted by the newspaper no verification of the truth is required.

3.191  Clause 6 provides for a new defence of qualified privilege relating to peer-reviewed material 
in scientific or academic journals. Clause 7 amends the Defamation Act 1996 which contains 
defences  of  absolute  and  qualified  privilege  to  extend  the  circumstances  in  which  such 
defences can be used.

3.192  Clause 8 sets out a single publication rule, which has the effect that the one year limitation 
period starts to run from the date of the first publication of the material to the public or 
section of the public. This will represent a substantive change to the law which previously 
had a “multiple publication” rule, namely that each publication of defamatory material gives 
rise to a separate cause of action subject to its own limitation period. The single publication 
rule bites provided that any subsequent publication is the same or substantially the same 
publication, and provided that the publication is not materially different from the manner of 
the first publication.322

3.193  The Bill also contains some provisions targeted at new media and in particular the internet. 
Clause 5 creates a new defence for operators of websites where a claim for defamation is 
brought in respect of a statement posted on the website if the operator did not post the 

321 As defined in clause 3(7). The defences listed include absolute privilege under s14 of the 1996 Act, the defence 
of qualified privilege under s15 of the 1996 Act, the defences in clauses 4 and 6 of the Bill relating to responsible 
publication on a matter of public interest and peer-reviewed statements in a scientific or academic journal 
322 Clause 8(4)

APPENDICESstatement. The defence will not be available however if the claimant could not identify the 
person who posted the statement, the operator was given notice of the complaint and failed 
to respond to that notice in accordance with the provisions to be set out in regulations to be 
made by the Secretary of State. The details of this clause, including what needs to be included 
in the notice and the steps required of the website operator are to be set out in regulations, 
and this gives rise to some uncertainty as to how this part of the new regime may operate.

3.194  Two clauses in the Bill seek to address practical considerations and costs concerns that have 
arisen in the context of defamation claims, namely the cost of jury trials and the volume of 
defamation cases issued in the courts of England and Wales where there are tenuous links to 
this jurisdiction. Clause 11 removes the right to trial by jury and any presumption in favour 
of a jury trial with the effect that defamation cases will be tried by a judge unless the court 
orders  otherwise.  The  other  clause  of  significance  is  clause  9  which  seeks  to  address  the 
problem of ‘libel tourism’ and sets a relatively high threshold for parties seeking to bring a 
claim against a defendant not domiciled in the UK, an EU member state or state which is party 
to the Lugano Convention: namely that the courts do not have jurisdiction unless it can be 
shown that England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate place to bring an action.

Information Commissioner
Legislative background to the protection of personal data
A right to privacy, as distinct from specific protection of personal data, has been explicitly 
recognised at an international level since 1948 when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
incorporated in Article 12 a right to be protected against arbitrary or unlawful interference 
with privacy. Article 12 was reproduced in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights in 1966. Subsequently, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development recognised the inherent link between protection of privacy and restrictions on 
processing personal information, and adopted guidelines seeking to restrain the cross border 
flow of information.323

4.2 

The  Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Individuals  with  regard  to  Automatic  Processing  of 
Personal Data of the Council of Europe (the Convention) was opened for signature in 1981. 
This was the first legally binding international instrument with the specific objective of data 
protection. Its purpose was:

“to  secure  [...]  for  every  individual  [...]  respect  for  his  rights  and  fundamental 
freedoms, and in particular his right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing 
of personal data.”

4.3 

Chapter II of the Convention sets out the basic principles of data protection, rights of data 
subjects and requires parties to the Convention to take steps to ensure that domestic law 
gives effect to the basic principles set out in the Convention.

323 The OECD guidelines set out eight basic principles of national application which are recognisable in the DPA 1998: 
(1) The collection limitation principle; (2) the data quality principle; (3) the purpose specification principle; (4) the use 
limitation principles; (5) the security safeguards principle; (6) the openness principle; (7) the individual participation 
principles; and (8) the accountability principle 

1903

4.7 

4.8 

Two particular provisions are worthy of note. Article 5 sets out the conditions for the automatic 
processing of personal data including the requirement that personal data is obtained and 
processed fairly and lawfully, stored for legitimate purposes, is adequate and relevant for 
its purpose, is accurate and up to date and preserved in a form which permits identification 
of the data subject for no longer than required for its purposes. Article 8 grants rights to 
data subjects, including the right to establish the existence of an automated personal data 
file,  to  confirm  whether  personal  data  are  stored  in  the  automated  data  file,  to  receive 
communication of such data in an intelligible form, to obtain rectification or erasure of such 
data if these have been processed contrary to the provisions of domestic law and to have a 
remedy if a request for confirmation, rectification or erasure is not complied with.

Chapter  III  restricts  the  cross  border  flow  of  personal  data  in  certain  circumstances  and 
Chapter IV contemplates mutual assistance between the parties to the Convention in order to 
implement the Convention. Article 13 requires the parties to the Convention to designate one 
or more authorities to have responsibility for assisting other parties to the Convention and 
to furnish information on the law and administrative practice in the field of data protection.

Data Protection Act 1984

The Data Protection Act 1984 (the 1984 Act) implemented the United Kingdom’s obligations 
under the Convention and sought to regulate the use of automatically processed information 
relating to individuals and the provision of services in respect of such information.

The 1984 Act established the position of Data Protection Registrar and also a Data Protection 
Tribunal.324 It obliged organisations holding personal data to register with the Data Protection 
Registrar and thereafter to abide by the principles  of data protection outlined  in the Act. 
These principles mirrored those set out in the Convention and were replicated in Schedule 1 
of the 1984 Act.

The Data Protection Registrar had responsibility for maintaining a register of data users who 
held and provided services in respect of personal data and a register of accepted applications 
for registration made by such users and for, determining applications to be a registered data 
user.325 The Data Protection Registrar was given powers to take enforcement action against 
registered  users  who  had  contravened  the  data  protection  principles  including  the  power 
to de-register a data user for breach of the data protection principles and to issue a notice 
prohibiting the transfer of personal data outside the United Kingdom.326

4.9 

The 1984 Act made no special provision in relation to the press.

Data Protection Directive

4.10  Directive  95/46/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  protection  of 
individuals  with  regard  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  and  on  the  free  movement  of 
such  data  (the  Data  Protection  Directive)  was  adopted  on  24  October  1995  and  required 
implementation by October 1998. The Directive itself was a response to the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines and adopts a number of the same 
principles.

APPENDICES4.11  The Data Protection Directive requires that each member state must set up a supervisory 
authority,  which  acts  as  an  independent  body  that  will  monitor  the  data  protection  level 
in  that  member  state,  give  advice  to  the  government  about  administrative  measures  and 
regulations, and start legal proceedings when data protection regulation has been violated.327 
In the United Kingdom, this authority is the Information Commissioner.

4.12  The objective of the Data Protection Directive is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms 
of  natural  persons,  and  in  particular  their  right  to  privacy  with  respect  to  the  processing 
of  personal  data.328  The  Data  Protection  Directive  sought  to  harmonise  data  protection 
legislation  throughout  the  European  Union  by  requiring  member  states  to  determine  the 
conditions  under  which  the  processing  of  personal  data  is  lawful,  in  accordance  with  the 
criteria and principles set out in the Directive.329 It is a harmonisation measure and operates 
by setting a minimum standard to be adopted by member states.

4.13  The Data Protection Directive has been supplemented by other legal instruments, such as the 
e-Privacy Directive and specific rules for the protection of personal data in police and judicial 
cooperation in criminal matters.330

4.14  The Data Protection Directive defines a number of core terms which are replicated in the 

Data Protection Act 1998.331 These terms are explored in detail below.

4.15  The  general  rules  on  the  lawfulness  of  processing  personal  data  are  set  out  in  Chapter  II 
to  the  Data  Protection  Directive.  Article  6  provides  that  the  data  controller  is  responsible 
for ensuring that personal data is processed in accordance with particular criteria, including 
fairly and lawfully. Article 7 of the Directive sets out the specific criteria for legitimate data 
processing  and  this  is  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Article  8  which  sets  out  categories  of 
processing for which specific restrictions apply.

4.16  By recital  37, the European  Parliament and  the Council  recognised  that the processing  of 
personal data:“for purposes of journalism or for purposes of literary or artistic expression” 
engaged the “right to receive and impart information, as guaranteed in particular in art 10 of 
the ECHR” and should therefore be exempt from the Directive’s requirements to the extent 
necessary  for  the  reconciliation  of  such  conflicting  rights.  The  Data  Protection  Directive 
requires Member States to provide exemptions or derogations from these provisions for the 
processing  of  personal  data  carried  out  solely  for  journalistic  purposes  or  the  purpose  of 
artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with 
the rules governing freedom of expression.332 It also gives data subjects a prima facie right to 
obtain from the data controller data relating to herself or himself, although this right to data 
may be overridden by defined exceptions.333

327 Article 28 
328 See Article 1(1). Lord Justice Buxton noted in Johnson v Medical Defence Union Ltd (No 2) [2007] EWCA Civ 262 at para 
16 that “it is not easy to extract from [the Directive] any purpose other than the protection of privacy”

subject’)”. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an 
identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or 
social identity. Processing means “any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether 
or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, 
consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, 
blocking, erasure or destruction.” The responsibility for compliance lies with the “controller”, meaning the natural or 
artificial person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes 
and means of the processing of personal data

Home  Office  issued  a  consultation  paper  on  the  Directive.  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the 
Home  Department  subsequently  presented  proposals  for  new  data  protection  legislation, 
which took the form of the Data Protection Act 1998.

Data Protection Act 1998
Introduction

4.18  The Data Protection Act 1998 (the DPA) replaced the Data Protection Act 1984 and sought to 
implement the provisions of the Data Protection Directive by establishing a system of data 
protection controls for manual data as well as computerised data. Lord Williams of Mostyn 
commenced his second reading speech for the Data Protection Bill on 2 February 1998 with 
the following comments:334

“The Bill will improve the position of citizens of his country by enabling them to rely 
on a wide range of civil and political rights contained in the European Convention on 
Human Rights. Those rights include the right to respect for private and family life. The 
Data Protection Bill also concerns privacy, albeit a specific form of privacy; personal 
information privacy.”

Key concepts and structure of the Data Protection Act 1998

4.19 

In broad terms, the DPA seeks to ensure that personal data is used in accordance with the data 
protection principles, attaches certain conditions to the processing of personal data and adds 
extra safeguards where the personal data is sensitive. The DPA also establishes certain rights 
for a data subject and establishes a framework of enforcement. The legislation responds to 
the requirement to protect the privacy of recorded information relating to an individual.

4.20  At the heart of the DPA are a number of defined terms used throughout the Act. It is important 
to  understand  these.  “Data”  means  information  processed  by  automatic  equipment, 
information recorded with the intention of being processed by such equipment, information 
held in relevant filing systems and recorded information held by a public authority.335 “Personal 
data”  means  data  which  relate  to  a  living  individual.336  “Processing”  encompasses  a  wide 
range of uses of data including obtaining, recording, holding, organising, altering, adapting, 
retrieving,  using  and  disclosing  data.337  Processing  also  includes  putting  data  into  print, 
namely publication.338 “Data controller” means the person or organisation who determines 
the purpose for which and the manner in which any personal data are processed, i.e who 

334 HL Hansard, 5th series, vol 585, col 436 
335 The Court of Appeal in Durant v Financial Services Authority [2004] FSR 28 held that a relevant filing system is limited 
to a system: 1) in which the files forming part of it are structure or references in such a way as clearly to indicate at the 
outset of the search whether specific information capable of amounting to personal data of an individual requesting it 
under section 7 is held within the system and, if so, in which file or files it is held; and 2) which has, as part of its own 
structure or referencing mechanism, a sufficiently sophisticated and detailed means of readily indicating whether and 
where in an individual file or files specific criteria or information about the applicant can be readily located

337 Defined in s1(1) 
338 The Court of Appeal in Campbell v MGN ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 1371 rejected an argument that processing did not 
include putting the data into print, and noted at 107 that “where the data controller is responsible for publication of 
hard copies that reproduce data that has previously been processed by means of equipment operating automatically, the 
publication forms part of the processing and falls within the scope of the Act”. In Johnson v Medical Defence Union Ltd 
(No 2) [2007] EWCA Civ 262 the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between publication of information that has already 
been automatically processed (which is captured by the Act) and the manual analysis of data before any automatic 
processing begins 

1906

APPENDICESdecides what is to be done with the information.339 The definition of data controller includes 
the press and media organisations. “Data processor” is the person who processes the data on 
behalf of the data controller.340

4.21  Certain  types  of  personal  data  are  defined  as  sensitive  personal  data.341  This  includes 
information as to (a) the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject, (b) political opinions, (c) 
religious  beliefs or other beliefs of a similar  nature, (d)  membership  of a trade union,  (e) 
physical or mental health or condition342, (f) sexual life, and (g) the commission or alleged 
commission of any offence, proceedings relating to this or disposal of such proceedings.

4.22  The  DPA  applies  to  a  data  controller  in  respect  of  any  data  where  the  data  controller  is 
established in the UK and the data is processed in the context of that establishment or the 
data controller uses equipment in the UK for the processing of data other than for the purpose 
of transit through the UK. 343

4.23  The DPA further sets out that it shall be the duty of a data controller to comply with the data 
protection principles in relation to all personal data with respect to which he or she is the 
data controller.344 This duty is subject to section 27, which introduces the exemptions in Part 
IV of the Act. Breach of this statutory duty to comply with the data protection principles gives 
rise to a private law cause of action, allowing the data subject to make a claim against the 
data controller.

4.24  The data protection principles define the manner in which all personal data must be processed. 

These principles are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Act:
•  Principle 1 – Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall 
not be processed unless (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and (b) 
in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also 
met.345

•  Principle 2 – Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful 
purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that pur-
pose or those purposes.

•  Principle 3 – Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the 

purpose or purposes for which they are processed.

•  Principle 4 – Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
•  Principle 5 – Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for 

longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.

of the law in particular in relation to the misuse of confidential information. The draftsman of the Act has not attempted 
to give the word any wider or special meaning and it is therefore necessary to apply to the processor of the personal data 
the same obligations of confidentiality as would otherwise apply but for the Act”

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials•  Principle 6 – Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data sub-

jects under this Act.

•  Principle 7 – Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against 
unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or de-
struction of, or damage to, personal data.

•  Principle 8 – Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the 
European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of 
protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of 
personal data.

4.25  Attention  is  usually  focused  on  the  first  data  protection  principle  which  imposes  a  three 
fold obligation on the data controller: fairness, lawfulness and compliance with one of six 
specified conditions in Schedule 2.346 Schedule 2 introduces concepts such as consent of the 
data subject and necessity in order to fulfill a legitimate aim; for example, compliance with 
a contract, a legal obligation, to protect the vital interests of the data subject, to promote 
the administration of justice, or the exercise of public functions in the public interest. Special 
conditions apply for the purposes of the first data protection principle if the relevant data 
is “sensitive” personal data.347 These requirements are set out in Schedule 3 to the Act and 
include: explicit consent to processing, processing to be necessary for exercising or performing 
any  right  or  obligation  conferred  or  imposed  by  law  in  connection  with  employment, 
processing to be necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another person, or 
information having been made public by steps deliberately taken by the data subject.

Rights of a data subject

4.26  The Act confers a number of rights on data subjects.348 These rights include:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

the right to be informed by any data controller whether personal data of which 
that individual is the data subject are being processed by or on behalf of that data 
controller;
if that is the case, to be given by the data controller a description of the personal 
data,  the  purposes  for  which  they  are  being  processed  and  the  recipients  or 
classes of recipients to whom they are or may be disclosed;
to have communicated the personal data to him or her in an intelligible form. 
Where  a  data  controller  cannot  comply  with  the  request  without  disclosing 
information  relating  to  another  individual  who  can  be  identified  from  that 
information, he or she is not obliged to comply with the request unless (a) the 
other individual has consented to the disclosure of the information to the person 
making the request, or (b) it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with 
the request without the consent of the other individual.349

4.27  The Act also confers on a data subject a number of further rights to require data processing 
to cease, or not to begin where that processing is likely to cause distress or damage, or where 
the processing is for the purposes of direct marketing of personal data in respect of which a 
person is the data subject, and to require the data controller to ensure that no decision taken 
by or on behalf of the data controller which significantly affects that individual is based solely 
on the processing by automatic means of personal data.350

346 Fairness is defined in Part II of Schedule 1 and in broad terms requires that processing is with consent if practical

1908

APPENDICES4.28  Section 13 provides that an individual who suffers damage by reason of any contravention 
by a data controller of any of the requirements of the Act is entitled to compensation from 
the data controller for that damage. Further, an individual who suffers distress by reason of 
any contravention by a data controller of any of the requirements of the Act is entitled to 
compensation from the data controller for that damage if the individual also suffers damage by 
reason of the contravention or the contravention relates to the processing of personal data for 
the special purposes.351 In practice relatively small sums have been award by way of damages, 
namely in the region of £50 to £5000.352 In April 2010 the Commissioner acquired the power 
under s55A to impose a monetary penalty if the Commissioner is satisfied that; (a) there has 
been a serious contravention of s4(4) by the data controller, (b) the contravention was of a 
kind likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress, and (c) the contravention was 
deliberate or the data controller knew or ought to have known of the risk of contravention, 
likelihood of causing substantial damage or distress and failed to take reasonable steps to 
prevent the contravention.

Restrictions on data controllers

4.29  Part  III  of  the  Act  imposes  certain  notification  requirements  on  data  controllers.  Personal 
data  must  not  be  processed  unless  an  entry  in  respect  of  the  data  controller  is  included 
in  the  register  maintained  by  the  Commissioner  under  s19.353  Failure  to  comply  with  this 
constitutes an offence, subject to a defence that the controller exercised all due diligence to 
comply with the duty.354 A data controller wishing to be included in the register must notify 
the Commissioner and the commissioner must maintain a register of persons who have given 
notification under section 18.355

Exemptions

4.30  Part IV sets out exemptions from compliance with certain obligations in the Act, where the 
obligations  potentially  conflict  with  other  important  public  interest  considerations.356  The 
exemptions disapply some of the data protection principles and some of the requirements of 
the Act imposed on data controllers. The relevant exemptions cover national security, crime 
and  taxation,  health  education  and  social  work,  regulatory  activity,  journalism,  literature 
and art, research history and statistics, manual data held by public authorities, information 
available to the public under an enactment, disclosures required by law or made in connection 
with legal proceedings, parliamentary privilege and domestic purposes. Schedule 7 to the Act 
sets out further miscellaneous exemptions.

351 In Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers [2002] EWHC 499 (QB) it was held that ‘damage’ means special or financial 
damages. It was stated (obiter) in Johnson v Medical Defence Union Ltd (No 2) [2007] EWCA Civ 262 that there is “no 
compelling reason to think that ‘damage’ in the Directive has to go beyond its root meaning of pecuniary loss”. However, 
in remitting the matter back to the trial judge the Court of Appeal stated at para 63 that “it seems to us to be at least 
arguable that the judge has construed “damage” too narrowly, having regard to the fact that the purpose of the Act was 
to enact the provisions of the relevant Directive. All these issues should be authoritatively determined at a trial”

Appendix 4 | Legal MaterialsSection 32 – exemption relating to processing of personal data 
for the purposes of journalism

Introduction to s32

4.31  The 1984 Act contained no specific exemption for the press, however Article 9 of the Directive 
required Member States to provide for exemptions or derogations for processing of personal 
data carried out solely for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes, to the extent that this is 
necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression. The 
DPA approaches the potential conflict between the obligations imposed on data controllers 
and the public interest in preserving the right to freedom of expression principally by means 
of section 32.

4.32  As Tugendhat J observed in Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis v Times Newspapers 
the statute refers to “journalism” and “journalistic material” and not to “journalists” and this 
is consistent with the Strasbourg jurisprudence that distinguishes between types of speech 
rather than types of speaker.357

4.33  The passage of the DPA through Parliament was not uncontroversial, some concerns were 
expressed about s32, then clause 31 of the Bill, that the exemption for the press was too wide 
and undermined the legislation and that the clause failed to protect privacy.358 Lord Lester of 
Herne Hill warned that the Bill failed to implement the directive in this respect.359

Scope of s32

4.34  Section 32(1) as enacted provides:

“(1)  Personal  data  which  are  processed  only  for  the  special  purposes  are  exempt 
from any provision to which this subsection relates if—

(a) the processing is undertaken with a view to the publication by any person of 

any journalistic, literary or artistic material,

(b) the data controller reasonably believes that, having regard in particular to the 
special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression, publication 
would be in the public interest, and

(c)  the  data  controller  reasonably  believes  that,  in  all  the  circumstances, 

compliance with that provision is incompatible with the special purposes.”

4.35  Section  32(3)  provides  that  in  considering  whether  the  belief  of  a  data  controller  that 
publication would be in the public interest was or is a reasonable one, regard may be had 
to his or her compliance with any code of practice which is relevant to the publication in 
question and has been designated by order of the Secretary of State.360

4.36  The  proper  scope  of  section  32(1)  has  been  the  subject  of  consideration  in  the  evidence 
heard  by  the  Inquiry  and  written  submissions  from  a  number  of  Core  Participants  to  the 
Inquiry. These are recorded here for completeness.

subsection 3, designated a number of Codes of Practice for the purposes of s32(3) including the PCC Code 

1910

APPENDICES4.37  The  issue  which  has  been  canvassed  before  the  Inquiry  is  whether  s32(1)(a),  properly 
interpreted, requires the processing of the relevant data to be undertaken with a view to 
publishing the data that is being processed (“the narrow view”), or whether s32(1)(a) requires 
only that the relevant data is processed with a view to publication of any journalistic material 
generally, irrespective of whether there is a view to publish the data (“the wide view”). The 
difference between these views can be illustrated by taking an example which Leading Counsel 
to the Inquiry canvassed with a number of witnesses. If a journalist obtained an ex-directory 
telephone number of the subject of a story they were writing for the purpose of contacting 
the individual and putting the story to them, does the act of obtaining and processing the 
telephone number fall within the s32 exemption on the basis that the processing is with a 
view to publication of an article generally, or does it fall outside the s32 exemption on the 
basis that the processing of the data is not with a view to publication of the data that is being 
processed; i.e the telephone number?

4.38  Mr Richard Thomas, former Information Commissioner, expressed the view that if the data 
controller is processing data with a view to contacting someone (for example someone who 
is  about  to  be  subject  of  a  story)  that  would  fall  outside  s32.361  By  contrast,  Mr  Graham 
responded that, whilst he agreed the processing was not with a view to publication of the 
data, the activity is for the preparation of an article for publication and some information may 
make it into the paper and some may not. Mr Graham stated that if the point is put that s32 
covers writing the piece but it doesn’t cover the obtaining of the evidence, this would be a 
challenging distinction about which he would need to think further.362

4.39  Guardian News Media have submitted that the broad view should be preferred and that the 
narrow view is inconsistent with the statutory language and case law. In their submission, in 
order for s32 to be interpreted in a narrow sense, i.e. where the processing of data must be 
undertaken with a view to publishing the data itself, this would arguably require the addition 
of words into s32(1)(a) of the Act, as follows:

“if (a) the processing is undertaken with a view to the publication by any person of 
[that data in] any journalistic material” (the words added are in square brackets and 
underlined).

4.40  They  further  rely  on  the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Campbell  v  MGN  as  being 

inconsistent with the narrow view of s32.363

4.41  The rationale for the exemption in s32 was expressed by the Court of Appeal in Campbell v 

MGN Ltd in the following terms:364

“The overall scheme of the Directive and the Act appears aimed at the processing and 
retention of data over a sensible period. Thus the data controller is obliged to inform 
the data subject that personal data about the subject have been processed and the 
data subject is given rights, which include applying under s.14 for the rectification,

of-Morning-Hearing-26-January-2012.pdf. Mr Graham clarified that this was not a matter he had given great 
consideration to and leading counsel’s opinion on this issue had not been sought 
363 [2003] QB 633 
364 [2002] EWCA Civ 1373 paras 122-124. The decision of the Court of Appeal was appealed to the House of Lords but 
this element of the judgment was not expressly considered by the House of Lords. The Court of Appeal in Campbell 
extended the duration of s32 to cover processing prior to or following publication and thus reversed the High Court’s 
decision that s32 was only applicable to processing with a view to publication and not to publication itself 

1911

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsblocking, erasure or destruction of the data on specified grounds. These provisions 
are  not  appropriate  for  the  data  processing  which  will  normally  be  an  incident  of 
journalism.
This is because the definition of processing is so wide that it embraces the relatively 
ephemeral  operations  that  will  normally  be  carried  out  by  way  of  the  day-to-day 
tasks, involving the use of electronic equipment, such as the lap-top and the modern 
printing press, in translating information into the printed newspaper. The speed with 
which  these  operations  have  to  be  carried  out  if  a  newspaper  is  to  publish  news 
renders it impractical to comply with many of the data processing principles and the 
conditions in Schedules 2 and 3, including the requirement that the data subject has 
given his consent to the processing.
Furthermore,  the  requirements  of  the  Act,  in  the  absence  of  s.32,  would  impose 
restrictions on the media which would radically restrict the freedom of the press.”

4.42  The Court of Appeal in Campbell held that “processing” under the DPA includes publication 
in print, thus reversing the decision of the High Court and extending the duration of the s32 
exemption to including processing for and after publication.365

4.43  Guardian News further submitted that the processing of personal data by journalists prior 
to publication, including the obtaining and use of a telephone number for the purpose of 
contacting a subject or source for potential comment or corroboration, must fall within the 
ambit  of  s32  otherwise  the  exemption  would  cease usefully  to  serve  the  objective  it  was 
designed to protect.366

Effect of s32 exemption

4.44  Where the conditions in s32(1) are met, there is an exemption from all data protection principles 
(save for the duty to keep data secure) and the obligation to comply with a number of rights 
of data subjects, including the right of subject access (s7), the right to prevent processing of 
personal data (s10), the right to prevent a decision being made on an automated basis (s12) 
and the rights relating to rectification, blocking, erasure and destruction of data (s14).

4.45  Further,  s32(4)  makes  special  provision  for  the  conduct  of  proceedings  that  have  been 
commenced by a person seeking subject access, the prevention of processing, rectification, 
blocking or erasing of data, or compensation for breach of the Act where the data is subject 
to processing for the purposes of journalism. If the data controller claims or it appears to the 
court that the data in question are being processed only for special purposes and with a view 
to publication of journalistic material which had not been published by the data controller 
previously  the  court  must  stay  the  proceedings  until  either  the  data  controller  withdraws 
their claim or a s45 determination is issued. The evidence of the Information Commissioner 
is that in many cases the Information Commissioner will not be in a position to make a s45 
determination, leaving the proceedings stayed indefinitely.367

365 At paras 96-120 in particular. On appeal to the House of Lords it was agreed that the DPA claim stood or fell with the 
outcome of the appeal on breach of confidence. The appeal in relation to the breach of confidence claim succeeded, 
although the House of Lords made no specific findings or comment on the Court of Appeal’s analysis of the DPA 
366 Guardian News and Media rely on the statement of Buxton LJ in Johnson v Medical Defence Union (No.2) [2007] 
EWCA Civ 262, [2008] Bus LR 503 at para 41, where he stated: “The argument put to the court [in Campbell], which 
had been adopted by the trial judge, was that the expression “with a view to” limited the exemption to acts prior to 
publication. The court was very concerned that that limitation would effectively nullify the investigative journalism that 
the exemption seemed designed to protect”

APPENDICESPowers of investigation and enforcement

4.46  The  duty  to  enforce  the  provisions  of  the  DPA  lies  with  the  Information  Commissioner 
(the Commissioner) whose powers and duties are set out in Part V of the Act and can be 
summarised as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

If  the  Commissioner  is  satisfied  that  a  data  controller  has  contravened  or  is 
contravening any of the data protection principles, the Commissioner may serve 
an enforcement notice requiring him to take such steps or refrain from taking 
such steps as may be specified and/or to refrain from processing personal data.368 
In considering whether to issue an enforcement notice the Commissioner shall 
consider whether the contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person 
damage or distress.
The Commissioner may serve on a data controller an assessment notice for the 
purpose of enabling the Commissioner to determine whether the data controller 
has complied or is complying with the data protection principles.369 An assessment 
notice  facilitates  the  exercise  by  the  Commissioner  of  investigatory  powers, 
including entry to premises, obtaining inspection or examination or documents, 
information or equipment, and requiring persons to be available for interview. 
Powers of entry and inspection are set out in detail in Schedule 9.
If any person who is, or believes themselves to be, directly affected by processing 
of personal data requests an assessment as to whether it is likely or unlikely that 
the processing has been or is being carried out in compliance with the provisions 
of  this  Act,  the  Commissioner  shall  make  an  assessment  in  such  manner  as 
appears to him to be appropriate.370
The Commissioner may serve on a data controller an information notice requiring 
a data controller to furnish the Commissioner with specified information relating 
to the request or compliance with the principles.371

4.47 

It is an offence to fail to comply with an enforcement notice, an information notice or a special 
information notice.372 A person on whom an enforcement notice, an assessment notice, an 
information notice or a special information notice has been served may appeal against the 
notice to the Information Tribunal.373

4.48  Whilst the Commissioner has a broad suite of enforcement powers at his disposal, the balance 
of evidence before the Inquiry suggests that there has to date been limited use of formal 
enforcement powers.

4.49  Mr Thomas described the power to serve enforcement notices contained in s40 as the main 
formal  power  which  the  Commissioner  had  in  its  armoury  for  occasions  when  it  felt  that 
there had been non-compliance with the requirements of the legislation. He observed that 
the power was not used frequently, but there was a power to serve an enforcement notice 
on a data controller and that could be challenged, but if it was not challenged, then in due 
course it became a criminal matter not to obey the terms of an enforcement order.374 In terms

1913

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsof numbers of enforcement notices served, Mr Thomas estimated this was probably only two 
or three in a year, and they were normally preceded by a draft of a notice which was served 
before  the  Commissioner  entered  the  actual  notice  as  a  matter  of  good  regulation.375  Mr 
Thomas agreed that in principle this power would apply to media organisations but this is 
subject to exemptions in s32.376

Enforcement powers in relation to the press

4.50  The enforcement powers set out in the Act are modified where the data processing is for the 

purposes of journalism.

4.51  The first step is for the Information Commissioner to establish whether processing is for the 
purposes of journalism linked to the publication of journalistic material. Section 44 of the Act 
empowers the Information Commissioner to serve a “special information notice” to instigate 
an investigation of the data controller where; i) he receives a request for an assessment by an 
affected person, or ii) court proceedings have been stayed on the basis that a data controller 
claims or it appears to the court that the processing under consideration is for the purposes 
of journalism and the Information Commission has reasonable grounds for suspecting that 
the personal data are not being processed only for the purposes of journalism or with a view 
to publication of journalistic material. As a consequence of these provisions the Information 
Commissioner  is  not  able  to  issue  a  special  information  notice  to  initiate  an  investigation 
if it appears to him that information was gathered for journalism purposes with a view to 
publication (even if the gathering of the data was unlawful), unless a complaint is made by 
an affected person.

4.52  The  extent  of  an  investigation  under  s44  is  limited  to  resolving  the  question  of  whether 
personal data are being processed for the purposes of journalism and to ascertain if they 
are processed with a view to future publication of material. There is no power to investigate 
under  a  special  information  notice  whether  the  data  controller  has  committed  any  other 
offence under the Act.

4.53  The second step is a determination. If it appears to the Commissioner (whether as a result 
of the service of a special information notice or otherwise) that any personal data are not 
being processed only for the special purposes, or are not being processed with a view to the 
publication by any person of any journalistic material which has not previously been published 
by the data controller, he or she may make a determination in writing to that effect.377

4.54  Until a determination is made under s45, the Information Commissioner may not issue an 
information notice requiring the data controller to provide him with other information, issue 
an  enforcement  notice  or  exercise  their  powers  of  entry  and  inspection  provided  under 
Schedule 9 of the Act where the data processing is for the purposes of journalism.378 Thus the 
Commissioner’s investigatory powers are restricted in these circumstances.

4.55  Section  46  imposes  a  procedural  restriction  on  use  of  enforcement  powers  in  respect  of 
processing of data for journalistic purposes even if it appears to the Information Commissioner 
that enforcement action is justified. It prohibits the Commissioner from serving an enforcement 
notice on a data controller in respect of processing personal data for journalistic purposes

1914

APPENDICESunless a determination under s45(1) has been made and the court has granted leave for the 
notice to be served. It is noteworthy that as at September 2011, no enforcement notices have 
been issued by the Information Commissioner in any cases where s32 is relevant.379

4.56  The court may not grant leave to serve the notice unless it is satisfied that the Commissioner 
has reason to suspect a contravention of the data protection principles which is of substantial 
public importance and, except where the case is one of urgency, that the data controller has 
been given notice of the application for leave in accordance with rules of court.

4.57  The  Inquiry  heard  evidence  that  the  investigative  and  enforcement  powers  at  the 
Commissioner’s disposal exist to ascertain whether personal data are being processed for 
purposes other than journalism and to act in relation to those other purposes, rather than to 
enable it to regulate the actual processing of personal data for journalistic purposes.380

4.58  Since April 2010 the Information Commissioner has had the power to impose a civil monetary 
penalty  of  up  to  £500,000  for  serious  breaches  of  data  protection.  Mr  Graham  observed 
that this power is beginning to have a very salutary effect, both on public authorities and 
on  commercial  companies  who  realise  that  the  Information  Commissioner  has  teeth.381 
However, he noted in relation to the media that, given the limitations on the investigatory 
powers available to the Information Commissioner, in practice it would be difficult for the 
Commissioner to establish whether the processing was in breach of the data principles or 
whether  the  exemption  at  s32  of  Act  applied  such  that  the  processing  was  exempt  from 
compliance with data protection principles.382

Section 55 offence
Scope of s55(1)

4.59  Section  55(1)  makes  it  a  criminal  offence  to  knowingly  or  recklessly,  without  the  consent 
of the data controller (a) obtain or disclose personal data or the information contained in 
personal data, or (b) procure the disclosure to another person of the information contained 
in personal data, subject to specified defences in section 55(2). An offence can therefore be 
committed by three different types of activity: obtaining information, disclosing information, 
and procuring the disclosure of information.

4.60  This  section  of  the  Act  is  significant  because,  whilst  the  DPA  primarily  regulates  data 
controllers,  any  person  can  commit  an  offence  under  s55.  There  may  be  effectively  two 
victims when an s55 offence is committed: the data controller (i.e the organisation holding 
personal information) from whom the data is wrongfully obtained and the person to whom 
the data relates.383

Thomas-CBE.pdf. The practice of enforcement of s55 is considered in paras 10 – 14, ibid 

1915

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials4.61  Mr Thomas described s55 of the DPA 1998 as “an entirely self-contained part of the Act”.384 
He also regarded a s55 offence as one of the utmost severity, noting that “a section 55 offence 
is often as least as serious as phone hacking and may be even more serious”.385

4.62 

In  discussing  the  scope  of  the  s55  offence,  Mr  Thomas  expressed  the  view  that  “obtain” 
meant more than just receive. He said that it meant to seek out and obtain, but stated that 
the issue as to whether “obtain” could include the use of an agent or third party had not been 
considered by the ICO.386 Mr Thomas was asked whether a journalist who asked a private 
investigator to obtain personal data, and subsequently received it through the agency of the 
private investigator would commit an offence under s55. Mr Thomas would not commit to 
a view as to whether this would fall within s55387 although he noted that there is a greater 
challenge in bringing a successful prosecution under s55(1)(b), which relates to procuring the 
disclosure of information, than under s55(1)(a).

4.63  Commenting on the scope of s55 and whether position of a journalist could fall within ss55(1) 
(a)  and  (b),  Mr  Aldhouse,  former  Deputy  Information  Commissioner,  stated  that  he  was 
inclined to the view that the fact that you use an intermediary to obtain the information 
doesn’t mean that you have not yourself obtained it and therefore the action of a journalist 
could either be “obtaining” within subsection (a) or “procuring” within subsection (b), and 
probably falls within both subsections. 388

Public interest defence in s55(2)

4.64  There is an express public interest defence set out in s55(2), namely that an offence will not 
be committed where in the particular circumstances the obtaining, disclosing or procuring 
was justified as being in the public interest.389 The defence set out in s55(2)(d) was described 
by Mr Thomas as an objective test.390 He noted that “public interest” is not defined in the 
DPA and whilst the Information Commissioner has drafted some guidance on the meaning of 
public interest during his tenure this was never published.391 The concept of public interest 
is one that is familiar to the courts and is regularly considered in the context of claims for 
misuse of private information and defamation.

4.65  The meaning of public interest was explored with Mr Thomas in his evidence. He agreed that 
it would be very difficult to justify conduct in public interest terms if someone was merely 
fishing for information without having identified in his or her mind what the public interest 
might be before starting the exercise.392 He thought it would be difficult for someone to say 
that finding out the name, telephone number or the address of someone so they could talk to 
them (in the context of checking a story) would be a matter of public interest. He expressed 
the view that it would be difficult to justify the vast majority of celebrity tittle-tattle in public

APPENDICESinterest  terms.393  Mr  Graham  noted  that  the  broad  scope  given  to  the  public  interest  in 
journalism in Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers suggested that a successful prosecution 
of a journalist would be unlikely.394 He said it was arguable that a journalist would have a public 
interest defence in circumstances where he was trying to obtain an ex directory telephone 
number from search group to contact the subject of a story. Mr Graham emphasised in his 
evidence that making a judgment on where the balance of the public interest lies on the facts 
of each case is something that the Information Commissioner is called upon to do under both 
the DPA and FOIA.395

4.66  Subsections 55 (4)-(8) make it an offence to sell or offer to sell personal data which has been 
or is subsequently obtained or procured knowingly or recklessly without the consent of the 
data controller.

Penalty for breach of s55(1)

4.67  Offences are punished by a fine of up to £5,000 in the Magistrates’ Court and an unlimited 
fine in the Crown Court. However, since the Act came into force the penalties imposed by 
courts for the commission of data protection offences have been relatively light. Between 
November 2002 and January 2006, only two out of 22 cases resulted in fines amounting to 
more than £5,000.396

4.68  The  Information  Commissioner’s  report  to  Parliament  “What  Price  Privacy?  The  unlawful 
trade in confidential personal information”, published on 13 May 2006, and the follow up 
report  “What  Price  Privacy  Now?”,  published  on  13  December  2006,  recommended  that 
the Lord Chancellor bring forward proposals to increase the penalty for persons convicted 
under s55 to a maximum of two years’ imprisonment, a fine, or both on indictment; and on 
summary conviction to a maximum of six months’ imprisonment, a fine, or both. The purpose 
of this recommendation was to discourage the undercover market in personal information, 
and to send a clear signal that unlawfully obtaining personal information would constitute a 
crime.397

4.69  The report “What Price Privacy Now?” set out in tabular form the publications which had 
been identified from documentation seized during Operation Motorman as being involved 
in the unlawful obtaining or procuring of personal data.398 The report noted at paragraph 5.8 
that documents seized as part of Operation Motorman showed thousands of s55 offences and 
gave details of a number of identifiable reporters who had been supplied with information 
obtained unlawfully; implicating some 305 journalists.

4.70  A summary of the penalties imposed following convictions for data protection offences is 
set out in Annex A of the report “What Price Privacy?” The table demonstrates that of the 
prosecutions  pursued  between  2002  and  2006  by  the  Information  Commission,  23  of  26 
resulted in convictions. It was noted that prosecutions brought under the Act have generally 
resulted in low penalties: either minimal fines or conditional discharges. Between November

than £5000.399

Investigation and enforcement of s55 offences

4.71  Under schedule 9 of the Act, the ICO has powers of entry and inspection if it has reasonable 
grounds for believing that an offence has been committed. Mr Thomas noted that the ICO 
needed a warrant from a district judge to exercise these powers.400

4.72 

4.73 

4.74 

In terms of the practicality of investigation and enforcement of s55, Mr Thomas explained 
that  s55  enforcement  was  the  responsibility  of  a  small  investigations  team  composed  of 
former police and customs officers and that the ICO felt that its teams were not large enough 
and were under-resourced.401 Mr Thomas noted that if there is evidence of corruption and 
dishonest behaviour, which carries a stronger sentence, then it is inevitable that the case will 
be handed to the police and to the Crown Prosecution Service.402 For example, he recalled 
that  there  was  evidence  that  private  detectives  were  paying  money  to  people  inside  the 
DVLA, British Telecom and the police service to get information. As this was a far more serious 
matter  than  a  breach  of  s55,  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  took  over  responsibility  for 
prosecution.403

In his evidence, Mr Graham noted that there are practical challenges in the investigation of 
the involvement of individual journalists for s55 offences, including demonstrating the degree 
of knowledge on the part of the individual journalist, addressing the public interest defence 
available to the media, and in the absence of a power of arrest securing any co-operation from 
a journalist who would undoubtedly say that he or she does not reveal sources.404 However, 
he commented that none of these considerations of principle and practicality should prevent 
the proper enforcement of the criminal law against the media.405

In relation to the scope of s55, Mr Graham explained that in some circumstances personal 
data could be obtained in a way that suggests the commission of offences under s55 of the 
Data Protection Act and other legislation. The investigation of offences which carry custodial 
sentences  are,  in  practice,  given  precedence  over  the  investigation  of  offences  which  do 
not, and the police will lead investigations where offences that carry a custodial penalty are 
suspected.

Amendments to s55

4.75  The Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA) commenced a consultation exercise on 24 
July 2006 in relation to the possibility of increasing penalties for deliberate and wilful misuse 
of personal data. The DCA published their response on 7 February 2007, which contained the 
following summary:

APPENDICES(a)  Respondents  generally  welcomed  the  introduction  of  custodial  penalties  to 
provide  a  deterrent  to  potential  offenders,  to  provide  public  reassurance  that 
offenders would receive the appropriate sentence and to achieve parity with a 
number of disparate pieces of legislation which deal with similar types of offences.
The majority of respondents agreed that custodial penalties would be an effective 
deterrent because it would demonstrate the legal importance of data protection 
compliance and the seriousness of the offence. A few respondents did not agree 
with the proposal and argued that unlimited fines were more appropriate.

(b) 

(c)  Many respondents agreed with the proposed length of custodial sentence and 
that the courts should have access to the same sanctions as it would for similar 
offences. A minority of respondents argued that a maximum sentence of twelve 
months  on  summary  conviction  and  five  years  on  indictment  would  be  more 
effective.

4.76  The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill contained a clause to introduce custodial sentences 
for s55 offences. A number of press organisations opposed this proposal and the clause was 
amended such that custodial sentences could be introduced only after a Ministerial Order, 
the  Order  being  preceded  by  consultation  with  media  organisations  and  other  interested 
parties.406 This is now found in s77 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (CJIA).

4.77  The  other  amendment  to  the  DPA  contemplated  by  the  CJIA  is  the  inclusion  of  a  further 
defence to the s55 offence, which is of specific relevance to journalists. This was enacted 
in s78 of the CJIA, although this section is not yet in force. If brought into force, it would 
be a defence where a person acted for special purposes, including journalism, with a view 
to the publication by any person of journalistic material and in the reasonable belief that 
the  obtaining,  disclosing  or  procuring  of  that  information  was  in  the  public  interest.  The 
amended  defence is  broader in  terms than  the  defence  currently  set  out  in  s55  DPA: the 
extended defence contemplated by s78 CJIA does not require a journalist to show that their 
conduct  in  obtaining,  procuring  or  disclosing  the  data  is  objectively  justified  in  the  public 
interest, but introduces a subjective element, namely that the journalist has a reasonable 
belief that the conduct is in the public interest and that they acted with a view to publication 
of journalistic material. Mr Graham described the proposed amended defence as a “very, 
very good increased defence for journalists”.407

4.78 

In terms of the possible amendments to the legislation which are currently found in s77 and 
s78 of the CJIA, Mr Graham explained that the current position is that the Government is 
awaiting the outcome of the Inquiry before taking a decision on activating ss77 and 78.408

4.79  There is support for the amended defence from a number of media organisations. For example, 
News  International  submitted  that  the  statutory language of  s55  at  present  produces  the 
bizarre result that a journalist investigating allegations of improper conduct in the honest and 
reasonable, though mistaken, belief that publication would be in the public interest would 
be  able  to  establish  an  exemption  from  civil  liability  but  unable  to  establish  a  defence  to 
a criminal charge arising out of the same facts. It is further argued that the importance of 
that amendment is that Parliament has expressly reconfirmed in the field of regulation of 
misuse of personal data by media organisations that the focus must be on whether the media

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsdefendant acted in the reasonable belief that its processing of data was in the public interest, 
and not on whether it actually was in the public interest.

Guardian News argued that s55 is more far reaching than unlawful theft and trading of confi-
dential information, catching not just those responsible for obtaining personal data but also 
those responsible for its procurement and – perhaps most critically for present purposes – for 
its subsequent disclosure.409 Whilst s78 of the CJIA provides specific protection for journalistic 
activity based on a subjective threshold, the reasonableness of the journalist’s belief at the 
time of publication remains to be assessed against an objective standard.

Role of the Information Commissioner

4.80  The  role  of  an  independent  data  protection  regulator  was  first  established  by  the  Data 
Protection  Act  1984  under  the  name  of  Data  Protection  Registrar.410  The  regulator  was 
renamed  as  the  Data  Protection  Commissioner  under  the  DPA  1998  and  the  name  was 
changed to Information Commissioner when the FOIA 2000 came into force.411 The functions 
of the Information Commissioner are set now out in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the 
Freedom of Information Act 2000.412 The various powers and duties contained in the Acts are 
vested in the Commissioner; although in practice they are largely discharged through some 
300 staff who constitute the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).413

Duties of the Information Commissioner in relation to the Data Protection Act 1998

4.81  The Act sets out a number of general functions and duties of the Commissioner. Generally 
these  relate  to  promoting  good  practice  rather  than  punishing  poor  practice  and  can  be 
described as functions relating to education and co-operation.414

4.82 

It  is  the  duty  of  the  Commissioner  to  promote  the  following  of  good  practice  by  data 
controllers and, in particular, to promote the observance of the requirements of the Act by 
data controllers.415

4.83  The Commissioner has a duty to disseminate information and guidance to the public relating 
to the Act. The information must set out details of the operation of the Act, good practice and 
other matters within the scope of his or her functions under the Act.416

4.84  The  Commissioner  must  arrange  for  the  dissemination,  in  such  form  and  manner  as  is 
considered appropriate, of such information as may appear expedient to give to the public 
about the operation of the Act, about good practice, and about other matters within the 
scope of his or her functions under the Act, and may give advice to any person as to any of 
those matters.417

APPENDICES4.85  The Commissioner has a duty where either (1) the Secretary of State so directs by order, 
or (2) the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so, to prepare and disseminate to 
such persons as he considers appropriate codes of practice to provide guidance as to good 
practice. Prior to issuing codes of practice the Commissioner must consult trade associations, 
data subjects or persons representing data subjects as appears to him to be appropriate.

4.86  The Information Commissioner must prepare a code of practice which contains (1) practical 
guidance in relation to the sharing of personal data in accordance with the requirements of 
the DPA, and (2) such other guidance as the Commissioner considers appropriate to promote 
good practice in the sharing of personal data. Before a code is prepared, the Commissioner 
must  consult  such  of  the  following  as  the  Commissioner  considers  appropriate:  (a)  trade 
associations, (b) data subjects, and (c) persons who appear to the Commissioner to represent 
the interests of data subjects.418 When such a code is prepared, it must be submitted to the 
Secretary of State for approval and there are rules as to procedure.419

4.87  The  Commissioner  also  has  responsibility  for  disseminating  information  relating  to:  (a) 
any finding of the European Commission that a country or territory outside the European 
Economic Area does, or does not, ensure an adequate level of protection, (b) any decision 
of the European Commission which is made for the relevant purposes, and (c) such other 
information as it may appear to him or her to be expedient to give to data controllers in 
relation to any personal data about the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects 
in relation to the processing of personal data in countries and territories outside the European 
Economic Area.420

4.88 

In  terms  of  duties  to  report,  the  Commissioner  must  lay  annually  before  each  House 
of  Parliament  a  general  report  on  the  exercise  of  his  or  her  functions  under  the  DPA.  The 
Commissioner may from time to time lay before each House of Parliament such other reports 
with respect to those functions as he or she thinks fit, under s52. In 2006, the Information 
Commissioner published two reports, “What Price Privacy? The unlawful trade in confidential 
personal information” and the “What Price Privacy Now?”, pursuant to this section.

4.89  A corollary of the fact that the DPA largely leaves it to individuals to take action to assert their 
rights in relation to processing of personal data for special purposes, including journalism, 
is  that  such  individuals  may  apply  to  the  Commissioner  for  assistance  in  their  cases.  An 
individual who is an actual or prospective party to any proceedings which relate to personal 
data processed for the special purposes, including the purposes of journalism, may apply to 
the Commissioner for assistance in relation to those proceedings.421 The power to provide 
assistance  is  limited  to  cases  which  involve  a  matter  of  substantial  public  importance. 
Assistance in most cases refers to the costs of advice or assistance from legal representatives 
or an agreement to indemnify the applicant against costs. The Commissioner must consider 
and decide whether and to what extent to grant the application, but cannot do so unless 
the  case  involves  a  matter  of  substantial  public  importance.422  The  existing  Information 
Commissioner notes that since 2009 no applications for such assistance have been made.423

Appendix 4 | Legal MaterialsDuties of the Information Commissioner in relation to the Freedom of Information Act 2000

4.90  The Commissioner has a number of powers and duties under FOIA. Whilst FOIA has not been 
the subject of extensive evidence before the Inquiry, it is useful to summarise the provisions 
of FOIA to the extent that they relate to the Commissioner in order to understand the entire 
framework of the regulatory position.

4.91  The purpose of the Act is stated at the outset to be, “to make provision for the disclosure of 

information held by public authorities or by persons providing services for them”.424

4.92  The FOIA creates a general right of access, on request, to information held by public authorities. 
On receipt of a freedom of information claim a public authority has two corresponding duties. 
Firstly,  a  duty  to  inform  a  member  of  the  public  whether  or  not  it  holds  the  information 
requested and secondly, if it does hold that information, to communicate that fact to the 
person making that request.425 A critical distinction between the DPA and the FOI is that whilst 
under the DPA a request for data is limited to data held about yourself as a data subject, there 
is no such constraint in relation to information held by the public authority that is sought 
under the FOIA.

4.93  The basic duty is supplemented by an additional duty to aid individuals in making requests 
and ensuring that they frame their FOI requests appropriately.426 A public authority is to be 
taken to have complied  with this duty in any particular case if it has conformed with the 
provisions of this Code in relation to the provision of advice and assistance in that case. The 
duty to assist and advise is enforceable by the Information Commissioner. If a public authority 
fails in its statutory duty, the Commissioner may issue a decision notice under s50, or an 
enforcement notice under s52.

4.94  At the heart of the FOIA is the definition of public authority – namely those bodies against 
whom the right to information can be asserted. Section 3 of the Act defines a public authority 
as any body, person or office-holder listed in Schedule 1, designated by order under s5 and 
publicly owned companies as defined in s6. Schedule 1 sets out a broad range of public bodies 
subject to the Act, including central Government departments, local government, strategic 
health authorities and primary care trusts, governing bodies of maintained schools, police 
authorities and a wide range of committees and commissions exercising public functions.

4.95  The Act contains a number of provisions which provide for exemptions from disclosure in 
relation  to  certain  types  of  information.  There  are  two  forms  of  exemption:  an  absolute 
exemption which is an absolute bar to disclosure, and qualified exemption which is subject to 
a public interest test, balancing the public interest in maintaining the exemption against the 
public interest in disclosure.

4.96  The absolute exemptions include information that: i) is accessible by other means, ii) relates 
to or deals with security matters iii) is contained in court records, iv) the disclosure of which 
would  infringe  parliamentary  privilege,  v)  information  held  by  the  House  of  Commons  or 
the House of Lords, where disclosure would prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs, 
vi)  information  which  (a)  the  applicant  could  obtain  under  the  Data  Protection  Act  1998; 
or (b) where release would breach the data protection principles, vii) information provided 
in  confidence,  viii)  where  disclosure  of  the  information  is  prohibited  by  an  enactment; 
incompatible with an EU obligation; or would commit a contempt of court.427

424 s1 
425 ss1(1)(a)-(b) 
426 s16(1)
427 ss21,23, 32, 34, 36, 40, 41, 44 

1922

APPENDICES4.97  The  Act  also  contains  qualified  exemptions  which  introduces  a  two  stage  test.  First,  the 
public authority must decide whether or not the information is covered by an exemption and 
second, the authority must disclose the information unless the application of a public interest 
test is such that the public interest outweighs disclosure.

4.98  A  number  of  qualified  exemptions  relate  to  particular  classes  of  documents,  namely 
information which that: i) is intended for future publication ii) required for the purpose of 
safeguarding  national  security,  iii)  is  held  for  purposes  of  investigations  and  proceedings 
conducted by public authorities, v) relates to the formation of government policy, ministerial 
communications, advice from government legal officers, and the operation of any ministerial 
private  office,  vi)  relates  to  communications  with  members  of  the  Royal  family,  and 
conferring honours, vii) prevents overlap between FOIA and regulations requiring disclosure 
of environmental information, viii) is covered by professional legal privilege, and ix) is a trade 
secret.428

4.99  A  number  of  qualified  exemptions  relate  to  particular  harm  that  may  be  occasioned  by 
compliance  with  the  duty  to  disclosure.  These  include  where  disclosure  would  prejudice: 
i) defence or the capability, effectiveness or security of any relevant forces, ii) international 
relations, iii) relations between any administration in the United Kingdom and any other such 
administration, iv) the economic interests of the UK, v) law enforcement (e.g., prevention 
of crime or administration of justice), vi) the auditing functions of any public authorities, or 
vii) would in the reasonable opinion of a qualified person prejudice the effective conduct 
of public affairs, prejudice collective responsibility, or inhibit the free and frank provision of 
advice or exchange of views, viii) would endanger physical or mental health, or endanger the 
safety of the individual, (ix) would endanger commercial interests.429

4.100  A  public  authority  is  entitled  to  refuse  to  comply  with  the  duties  in  s1(1)  in  particular 
circumstances (set out in Part II): where an absolute exemption is conferred on the public 
authority, or where in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining an 
exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. In the first instance, it 
is for the public authority to determine whether there are grounds for an exemption to apply, 
and if necessary, conduct a balancing exercising with the public interest in disclosure. If the 
person seeking the information is dissatisfied with the response there is a route of complaint 
to the Information Commissioner who must determine whether there are proper grounds 
for the information to be withheld and must issue a decision notice setting out the decision 
reached by the ICO.

4.101  It is important to note that for four public authorities listed under Schedule 1, the Act has 
limited effect. For example, Part VI of Sch 1 provides that the BBC, the Channel Four Television 
Corporation, the Gaelic media service and the Sianel Pedwar Cymru (the Welsh television 
channel known as S4C) are subject to the Act only in respect of information which is “held for 
the purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature”. The purpose of this exemption 
is  to  protect  journalistic  activities  from  possible  compromise.  This  section  of  the  Act  was 
recently analysed by the Supreme Court, which held that information held predominantly for 
the purposes of journalism does not fall within the scope of the Act, even if the information 
is held for other purposes as well.430

4.102  The Office of the Information Commissioner oversees the operation of the Act. Part IV of 

FOIA gives the Information Commissioner a number of enforcement powers.

428 ss22, 24, 30, 35, 37, 39, 42, and 43(1)

1923

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials4.103  The powers of the Information Commissioner include: i) a power requiring a public authority 
to furnish the Commissioner with information he or she reasonably requires to determine 
whether a public authority has complied with its obligations under Part 1 and whether its 
practices comply with the Code of Practice, (ii) a power to issue an enforcement notice, if the 
Commissioner is satisfied that a public authority has failed to comply with Part 1, requiring 
the public authority to take the steps in the notice, (iii) certify that a public authority has 
failed  to  comply  with  a  decision  notice,  information  notice  or  enforcement  notice,  which 
allows the High Court to inquire into the matter and the deal with the public authority as if it 
had committed contempt of court, (iv) powers of entry and inspection pursuant to Schedule 
33.431

4.104  Pursuant to s57 the public authority may appeal against a decision notice, information notice 

or enforcement notice to the Information Tribunal.

4.105  There are a number of general functions conferred on the Information Commissioner pursuant 

to s47 of the FOIA:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

(g) 

The  Commissioner  has  a  duty  to  promote  the  following  of  good  practice  by 
public authorities and in particular to perform his or her function under the Act 
to promote the observance by public authorities of the requirements of the Act 
and the provisions of the codes of practice under ss45 and 46. The Act confers 
a number of powers on him or her to enable this, specifically in relation to the 
Code.
The Commissioner shall arrange for the dissemination of information as it may 
appear expedient to give to the public about the operation of the Act, about good 
practice and other matters within the scope of his or her functions under the Act.
The Commissioner may, with the consent of any public authority, assess whether 
that authority is following good practice.
If it appears to the Commissioner that the practice of a public authority in relation 
to the exercise of its functions under the Act does not conform with that proposed 
in this Code of Practice, a recommendation may be given to the authority under 
s48 specifying the steps which should, the Commissioner’s opinion, be taken for 
promoting such conformity.
The Commissioner may also refer to non-compliance with the Code in decision 
notices issued as a result of a complaint under s50 of the Act and enforcement 
notices issued under s52 of the Act where, irrespective of any complaints that 
may have been received, the Commissioner considers that a public authority has 
failed to comply with any requirement of Part 1 of the Act.
If  the  Information  Commissioner  reasonably  requires  any  information  for  the 
purpose of determining whether the practice of a public authority conforms to 
the  Code,  under  s51  of  the  Act  the  Commissioner  may  serve  an  “information 
notice” on the authority, requiring it to provide specified information relating to 
its conformity with the Code.
The  Commissioner  shall  from  time  to  time  as  considered  appropriate  consult 
the Keeper of Public Records about the promotion by the Commissioner of the 
observance by public authorities of the provisions of the code of practice under 
s46 in relation to records which are public records for the purposes of the Public 
Records Act 1958.

431 ss51, 52, 54, and 55 

1924

APPENDICES4.106  Section 49 provides that the Commissioner shall lay annually before each House of Parliament 
a general report on the exercise of his or her functions under this Act and other such reports 
from time to time with respect these functions as thought fit.

Possible reform of the law in this area

4.107  In November 2010 the European Commission announced a review of the Data Protection 
Directive.432 On 25 January 2012, the European Commission published a draft European Data 
Protection Regulation that will supersede the Data Protection Directive.433 The Commission 
has proposed a new regime comprising:

(a) 

(b) 

a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection 
of  individuals  with  regard  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  and  on  the  free 
movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), and
a  proposal  for  a  Directive  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on 
the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by 
competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or 
prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the 
free movement of such data.

4.108  The draft Regulation seeks to modernise the legal framework for data protection needs in 
the  EU  in  response  to  increasingly  sophisticated  information  systems,  global  information 
networks, mass information sharing and the collection of personal data online.

4.109  A number of amendments to the current Directive are contemplated by the draft Regulation. 

These include:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

important 

legal  obligations  directly  on  processors: 

strengthening provisions relating to consent to the processing of data, by requiring 
explicit rather than implied consent,
strengthening the right to object to processing of data, with no requirement to 
show that use of the data would cause substantial damage or distress,
placing 
introducing  a 
compulsory  data  breach  notification  duty  that  applies  across  all  sectors,  a 
requirement to demonstrate compliance with the regulation through the adoption 
of policies and procedures, the requirement to undertake data protection impact 
assessments prior to processing that is likely to impact on the privacy of a data 
subject, and the power of supervisory authorities to impose sanctions on data 
controllers for administrative offences such as not complying with a data subject 
request, a failure to maintain the requisite records or a failure to comply with the 
right to be forgotten.

Article 80 is of particular relevance and concerns the processing of personal data and free-
dom of expression. It provides as follows:

5.  Criminal law

5.1 

Introduction
The criminal law imposes restrictions on the methods and practices used to obtain information 
from or about third parties. The conduct of journalists in this respect is restrained by the 
provisions  of  the  law  which  criminalise  forms  of  hacking,  blagging,  obtaining  information 
by payments to public officials, obtaining, disclosing or procuring the disclosure of personal 
data and obtaining information in breach of the Official Secrets Act. The criminal law also 
restricts  the  content  of  publications  in  certain  respects:  for  example,  there  are  statutory 
provisions which prevent the reporting of certain criminal proceedings, which criminalise the 
publication of information that has been disclosed in contravention of the provisions of the 
Official Secrets Acts, and which criminalise publications which incite hatred on grounds of 
race, religion or sexual orientation.

5.2  Whilst some offences are strict liability offences, other criminal offences are subject to an 
express  defence  that  the  conduct  was  in  the  “public  interest”.  In  these  circumstances  a 
journalist acting in the course of their profession may seek to persuade the court that their 
conduct, or the publication in question, was in the public interest.

5.3 

A journalist is not above the law and a journalist who breaks the law will be in the same 
position as any other member of the public – there is no exemption from compliance with 
the criminal law simply by virtue of their profession. However, particular provisions of the 
law and defences have special application to journalists. It is generally rare for the CPS to 
prosecute journalists who commit offences in the course of their work and a prosecutor will 
be required to balance the competing considerations in determining whether prosecution is

on the approach that prosecutors should take when assessing the public interest in cases 
affecting the media. These guidelines have immediate effect. The interim consultation period 
closed on 10 July 2012, after which final guidelines will be issued.

5.4 

As is apparent from the analysis in Part D Chapter 1 of the Report (to which reference is 
essential for an understanding of the role of regulation), that the operation and enforcement 
of  the  criminal  law  generates  real  challenges  for  the  police  and  other  law  enforcement 
agencies.  Having  said  that,  the  key  provisions  of  criminal  law  of  relevance  to  journalists, 
in  particular  the  restrictions  on  methods  and  practices  for  obtaining  information  and  the 
content of publications are as follows.

Restrictions on the methods of obtaining information

Interception of communications – Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

5.5 

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) creates two offences relating to the 
interception of communications:

(a) 

(b) 

It is an offence for a person intentionally and without lawful authority to intercept 
at  any  place  in  the  United  Kingdom  any  communication  in  the  course  of  its 
transmission by means of a public postal service or a public telecommunication 
system, see s1(1).
It is an offence for a person intentionally and without lawful authority to intercept 
at  any  place  in  the  United  Kingdom  any  communication  in  the  course  of  its 
transmission  by  means  of  a  private  telecommunication  system,  see  s1(2).  It  is 
a defence for a person who would otherwise be liable under s1(2) if they have 
a right to control the operation or the use of the system; or have the express or 
implied consent of such a person to make the interception, see s1(6).435

5.6 

5.7 

Section  1(1A),  which  came  into  force  on  16  June  2011,  provides  that  the  Interception 
of  Communications  Commissioner  may  serve  a  monetary  penalty  notice  on  a  person  if 
the  Commissioner  considers  the  person  has  intercepted  without  lawful  authority  any 
communication  in  the  course  of  its  transmission  by  means  of  public  telecommunication 
system and was not, at the time of the interception, making an attempt to act in accordance 
with an interception warrant which might explain the interception, and the Communications 
Commissioner does not consider that the person has committed an offence under s1(1).

Section 2(1) defines various terms including public postal service, public telecommunications 
service and private telecommunications system. Interception is defined in s2(2) as follows: 
a  person  intercepts  a  communication  in  the  course  of  its  transmission  by  means  of  a 
telecommunication system if, and only if, he (a) so modifies or interferes with the system or 
its operation, (b) so monitors transmissions made by means of the system, or (c) so monitors 
transmissions made by wireless telegraphy to or from apparatus comprised in the system, as to 
make some or all of the contents of the communication available, while being transmitted, to 
a person other than the sender or intended recipient of the communication. A tape recording 
of a telephone call by one party to the call without the knowledge of the other party does not

435 Control in this context means authorise and forbid, rather than the ability to physically use and operate the system: 
Stanford [2006] 1 WLR 1554 

1927

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials5.8 

amount to interception of a communication within s2.436 Further, a recording of one side of 
a telephone conversation picked up by a surveillance device in a car that does not record the 
speech of the other party does not amount to interception of a communication.437

The Inquiry has heard evidence that there has been some uncertainty as to the circumstances 
in which an offence will be committed under s1, and the interpretation of interception, as 
defined in s2(2).438 In particular, the statutory provisions are unclear as to whether an offence 
will be committed only if a voicemail message was intercepted before it was accessed by 
the  intended  recipient  (the  narrow  view),  or  whether  an  offence  is  also  committed  if  a 
communication is intercepted after it was accessed by the intended recipient and for so long 
as the system in question is used to store the communication in a manner which will enable 
the  recipient  to  have  access  to  it  (the  wide  view).  Whilst  there  is  arguably  some  support 
for the narrow view in the judgment of Lord Woolf CJ in R (NTL Group) v Crown Court at 
Ipswich the written opinion of Leading Counsel articulates persuasive arguments in favour of 
the wide view.439 Without seeking to determine the point, I endorse the view expressed by 
Leading Counsel that there are convincing arguments in support of a wider construction of 
the meaning of interception.

5.9 

The  offence  is  not  committed  in  circumstances  where  the  person  intercepting  the 
communication has lawful authority to do so. Lawful authority is defined in s1(5) as:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 
(d) 

authorisation by virtue of the consent to the interception of both the person who 
sent the communication and the intended recipient of the communication (s3);
authorisation under s4 (in relation to a person outside the UK and the interception 
is in accordance with circumstances set out in regulations made by the Secretary 
of State)440
interception takes place in accordance with an interception warrant (s5);
interception  in  relation  to  any  stored  communication  in  the  exercise  of  any 
statutory power that is exercised for the purpose of obtaining information or of 
taking possession of any document or other property.

5.10  The provisions and procedures in relation to issuing, exercising and overseeing a warrant are 

set out in ss5-11 of RIPA.

5.11  There is  no  public  interest defence for breach of  the provisions  and  there is  no  provision 
for anyone outside the police or security services to obtain a warrant to intercept calls or 
messages.

5.12  The maximum penalty on conviction on indictment is a term of two years of imprisonment 

and/or a fine, or on summary conviction a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum.

APPENDICESComputer hacking – Computer Misuse Act 1990

5.13  The Computer Misuse Act 1990 was introduced in August 1990 following a Law Commission 
report  surrounding  computer  misuse  and  the  need  to  react  to  increasing  technological 
development and potential abuse of this technology.441

5.14  The Act provides, in ss1, 2, 3 and 3A for criminal sanctions for unauthorised access to any 
material held on a computer and for impairment of the operation of a computer, with further 
sanctions if this is done with a view to the commission of a crime and for making, supplying 
or obtaining articles for use in the relevant offences.442

5.15  The  Computer  Misuse  Act  introduced  three  new  offences  into  UK  criminal  law  which  can 
be  summarised  in  broad  terms  as  follows:  unauthorised  access  to  computer  material, 
unauthorised access with intent to commit a further offence, and unauthorised modification.

5.16  Section 1 concerns unauthorised access to computer material. It provides that a person is 

guilty of an offence if they:

(a) 

(b) 
(c) 

cause a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any 
program or data held in any computer;443
the access intended is unauthorised; and
the  person  knows  at  the  time  when  they  cause  the  computer  to  perform  the 
function that that is the case.444

5.17  The meaning of computer is not defined in the Act, although there are strong arguments in 
favour of an interpretation which includes a voicemail system within the meaning of computer.

5.18  A person guilty of an offence under these provisions is liable on conviction on indictment to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years and/or to a fine, or on summary conviction 
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months and/or to a fine not exceeding the 
statutory maximum.445

5.19  Section 1 does not require the use of one computer to gain unauthorised access to another: 
an offence under section 1 can be committed if a program or data is accessed directly from 
the computer to which the defendant has access: A-G’s Reference (No 1 of 1991).446 Further, 
s1(1)  creates  an  offence  which  can  be  committed  as  a  result  of  having  intent  to  secure 
unauthorised access without in fact actually succeeding in accessing any data.447 The offence 
is drafted to include conduct that ordinarily would be within the scope of the law of attempt.

441 See Law Commission’s Working paper No.110 “Computer Misuse” and its report “Computer Misuse”, Law Com 
No.186 (1989) (Cm. 819); and the Scottish Law Commission’s Report on Computer Crime, Scot. Law Com No 106 (1987) 
(Cm. 174) 
442 As amended and added by ss 35(1), (3), 36, 37, Sch 14 paragraph 17 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 
443 The intended access need not be directed at any particular program or data, or program or data of any particular kind, 
or a program or data held in any particular computer, s1(2). ‘Secure access’ is defined in s17. A person secures access to 
any program or data held in a computer if, by causing a computer to perform any function, he or she (a) alters or erases 
the program or data, (b) copies or moves it to any storage medium other than that in which it is held or to a different 
location in the storage medium where it is held, (c) uses it, or (d) has it output from the computer in which it is held

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials5.20  Access of any kind by any person to any program held in a computer is “unauthorised” if they 
are not entitled to control access of the kind in question to the program or data, or do not have 
the consent to access the kind of program or data in question from any person so entitled.448 
The section identifies two ways in which authority may be acquired – either by being oneself 
the person entitled to authorise access or by being a person who has been authorised by a 
person entitled to authorise access. It also makes clear that the authority must relate not 
simply to the data or programme, but also the actual kind of access secured.449

5.21  There  is  some  uncertainty  as  to  whether  an  offence  is  committed  under  s1  by  a  person 
who  is  authorised  to  secure  access  to  particular  computer  material,  or  data,  but  does  so 
for unauthorised purposes.450 The leading authority on this point under the Data Protection 
Act  1984  (now  repealed)  was  DPP  v  Bignell,  in  which  the  Court  held  that  the  retrieval  of 
information from the police national computer (PNC), by someone with the proper authority 
under  the  Computer  Misuse  Act  1990, but  at  the  request  of  others  who  were  to  use  the 
data  for  non-police  purposes,  was  a  matter  for  the  Data  Protection  Act  1984  or  for  police 
disciplinary proceedings rather than the Computer Misuse Act 1990.451 However, dicta in DPP 
v Bignell which related to the Computer Misuse Act 1990 were disapproved in R v Bow Street 
Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex p Government of the United States of America which 
held that the Computer Misuse Act 1990 prevented someone with the authority to access 
data at a particular level on a computer system from accessing other data held on the same 
system  for  improper  purposes,  on  the  basis  that  such  access  will  be  unauthorised  access 
within the meaning of section 1(1).452 It therefore remains unclear as to whether a person 
who had authorised access to information held on a computer, for example the PNC, but 
accesses this information for improper purposes, for example to sell it to a journalist, would 
commit an offence under s1 as well as s55 of the DPA. In a number of cases involving misuse 
of information held on police computers, offenders have been prosecuted for misconduct in 
public office rather than under the 1990 Act.453

5.22  Section 2 covers unauthorised access to computer material pursuant to s1, with the intent 
to commit an offence or to facilitate the commission of further offences. The basis notion 
is that someone guilty of an offence under s1 will have further criminal sanctions imposed 
on them if this is done with the intention to commit or facilitate the commission of further 
offences, although it is not necessary to prove that the intended further offence has actually 
been committed.

5.23  Further offences for the purposes of s2 are offences which have a sentence fixed by law or 
where an individual found guilty of that offence would be liable for a term of imprisonment of 
five years or more. For example, a person will be guilty of an offence under s2 if unauthorised 
access  to  sensitive  information  held  on  a  computer  was  obtained  for  the  purposes  of 
blackmailing a person to whom that information related, or where unauthorised access was 
obtained for the purposes of theft.

5.24 

It is immaterial for the purposes of s2 whether the further offence is to be committed on 
the same occasion as the unauthorised access or on any future occasion and a person can

APPENDICESbe guilty of the offences under s2 even though the facts are such that the commission of the 
further offence is impossible.454

5.25  Section 3 creates an offence for unauthorised modification. A person is guilty of an offence 
if  they  do  any  unauthorised  act  in  relation  to  a  computer,  knowing  at  the  time  that  it  is 
unauthorised and either:

(a) 

(b) 

they intend by doing the act to impair the operation of any computer, to prevent 
or hinder access to any program or data held in any computer, or to impair the 
operation of any such program or the reliability of such data;455 or
they are reckless as to whether the act will do any of these things.456

5.26  A person found guilty of this offence is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 
a term not exceeding ten years and/or to a fine, or on summary conviction to imprisonment 
for a term not exceeding six months and/or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum.457

5.27  Section 3A relates to the making, supplying or obtaining of articles for use in offences under 
ss1 or 3. Section 3A provides that a person is guilty of an offence if a) they make, adapt, supply 
or offer to supply any article intending it to be used to commit, or to assist in the commission 
of, an offence under ss1 or 3, (b) they supply or offer to supply any article believing that it 
is likely to be used to commit or to assist in the commission of an offence under ss1 or 3, 
(c) they obtain any article with a view to its being supplied for use to commit, or to assist in 
the commission of, an offence under ss1 or 3. For the purposes of s3A “article” includes any 
program or data held in electronic form.458

5.28  There  are  no  guideline  cases  on  sentencing  for  offences  under  the  Computer  Misuse  Act 
1990.  In  the  case  of  Delamere,  an  employee  who  sold  confidential  details  of  two  bank 
account  holders  was  sentenced  to  four  months’  detention.459  In  the  case  of  Lindesay  a 
computer consultant who corrupted a website of a client company which had dismissed him 
was sentenced to nine months imprisonment following a guilty plea to three s3 offences.460

Section 55 Data Protection Act 1998

5.29  Section  55(1)  makes  it  a  criminal  offence  to  knowingly  or  recklessly,  without  the  consent 
of the data controller, (a) obtain or disclose personal data or the information contained in 
personal data, or (b) procure the disclosure to another person of the information contained 
in personal data, subject to specified defences in s55(2). This is considered above at 4.59.

454 ss 2(3)-(4) 
455 The intention need not relate to any particular computer, any particular program or data or a program or data 
of any particular kind, or any particular modification or a modification of any particular kind: s3(4). For s3(2) see for 
example Zezev and Yarimaka v Governor of HM Prison Brixton [2002] 2 Cr App R 515 where it was held than an offence 
was committed under the substituted s3 where the accused placed in another person’s email inbox a bogus email

Appendix 4 | Legal MaterialsBlagging offences – obtaining information by misleading or deceitful practices

5.30  There are a number of offences that potentially criminalise “blagging” or. in other words, the 

obtaining of information by using a pretence, false identity or false representations:

(a) 

(b) 

(e) 

s1 Fraud Act 2006 (fraud by false representation) and deception offences under 
the Theft Acts;
s1  Forgery  and  Counterfeiting  Act  1981,  Identity  Cards  Act  2006  (use  of  false 
documentation to prove identity);
s90 Police Act 1996 (impersonation of a police officer);

(c) 
(d)  Official Secrets Act 1920 (unauthorised use of uniforms, falsification of reports, 
forgery,  impersonation  or  the  false  use  of  documents  to  gain  admission  to  a 
prohibited place within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act 1911);
s55 DPA (unlawfully obtaining personal data).

The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978

5.31  The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978 set out deception offences which criminalise conduct in which 
something was dishonestly obtained. For example, s15 of the Theft Act 1968 criminalised 
obtaining property by deception and s1 of the Theft Act 1978 criminalised obtaining services 
by deception. By s15(4) of the Theft Act 1968, “deception” means any deception (whether 
deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including a deception as 
to the present intentions of the person using the deception or any other person. The judicial 
definition of deception frequently cited is “to deceive is … to induce a man to believe that at 
thing is true which is false”.461

5.32  These offences were repealed by the Fraud Act 2006 with effect from 15 January 2007. The 
old law is not, however, without relevance: it will continue to apply in so far as offences were 
committed or partly committed before that date.

Fraud Act 2006

5.33  The Fraud Act 2006 repealed the offences under the Theft Acts 1968 and 1978 and replaced 
them with a general offence of fraud as set out in s1 of the Act and an offence of obtaining 
services dishonesty, s11. It applies to offences committed after 15 January 2007.

5.34  Section 1(1) of the Act provides that a person is guilty of fraud if he or she is in breach of any 

of the sections listed in s1(2). There sections are:

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

fraud by false representations, s2;
fraud by failing to disclose information, s3;
fraud by abuse of position, s4.

5.35  Breaches of ss2 – 4 are not stand-alone offences, but are variations of an offence of fraud 

under s1.

461 Buckley J in Re London and Glove Finance Corporation [1903] 1 Ch 728 at 732 

1932

APPENDICES5.36  Section 2 concerns fraud by false representation. A person is in breach of s2 if they dishonestly 
make a false representation and intend by making that representation to i) make a gain for 
themselves or another, or ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.462

5.37  Section 3 concerns fraud by failing to disclose information. A person is in breach of s3 if they 
dishonestly fail to disclose to another person information which they are under a legal duty 
to disclose and intend, by failing to disclose the information i) to make gain for themselves or 
another, or ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.463

5.38  Section 4 concerns fraud by abuse of position. A person is in breach of s4 if they occupy a 
position in which they are expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests 
of another person, dishonestly abuse that position and intend, by means of the abuse of 
that position i) to make a gain for themselves or another, or ii) to cause loss to another or to 
expose another to a risk of loss.

5.39  The focus of these offences is the conduct and the intent of the defendant as opposed to 
the consequences of the conduct. Attempts to defraud that are unsuccessful, for example 
false representations made to obtain information that do not result in the obtaining of the 
information, may nevertheless still amount to fraud.

5.40  Dishonesty in fraud cases requires a two part test to be considered: firstly whether according 
to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people what was done was dishonest, 
and secondly whether the defendant must have realised that what they were doing was (by 
reference to the standards of reasonable and honest people) dishonest.464

5.41  The mens rea (i.e. mental) element common to all variants of the fraud offences is that the 
defendant must act either, with intent to secure a gain for themselves or another, or with 
intent to cause loss to another or expose another to a risk of loss. It is not necessary that the 
gain, loss or exposure to risk of loss actually occurs – the focus is on the mental state of the 
defendant. Gain and loss are defined in s5.

5.42  A  person  guilty  of  fraud  is  liable  on  summary  conviction  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  not 
exceeding six months and/or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum. A person convicted 
on indictment is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to a fine.465 The 
relevant sentencing guidelines for fraud offences are the SGC Guideline, Sentencing for Fraud 
– Statutory Offences.466

5.43  Section 11 concerns obtaining services dishonestly. A person is guilty of an offence under s11 
if they obtain services for themselves or another, a) by a dishonest act and, (b) in breach of 
s11(2), namely services are made available on the basis that payment has been, is being, or 
will be made for or in respect of the services, they obtain them without any payment having 
been made for the services in full, and, when they obtain the services they knows that, i) they 

462 s2(2) defines a representation as being false if: a) it is untrue or misleading, and (b) the person making it knows

5.44  A person guilty of an offence under s11 is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for 
a term not exceeding 6 months and/or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or on 
conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to a fine, or to 
both.

Falsification, forgery and counterfeiting

5.45  Offences  of  falsification  will  often  also  amount  to  fraud  within  the  meaning  of  the  Fraud 
Act 2006, although dishonesty need not be proved in cases charges under the Forgery and 
Counterfeiting Act 1981.

5.46  The  Forgery  and  Counterfeiting  Act  1981  repealed  a  number  of  older  statutory  offences 
of  forgery  and  abolished  forgery  at  common  law.  Part  1  of  the  Act  creates  the  following 
offences:467

(a)  making a false instrument, s1;
(b) 
copying a false instrument, s2;
(c) 
using a false instrument, s3;
(d)  using a copy of a false instrument, s4;
(e)  having custody or control of specified kinds of false instrument, s5(1); and
(f)  making or having custody etc of machines paper etc for making false instruments 

of that kind, s5(3)..

5.47  These offences all require an “intention to induce” somebody to accept the instrument as 
genuine and “by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other 
person’s prejudice”.468

5.48  An instrument is only regarded as false if it purports to be something it is not, or it tells a lie 

about its own authorship, origins or history.

Offences relating to identity documents

5.49  The Identity Cards Act 2006 was repealed on 21 January 2011 by the Identity Documents 
Act  2010,  although  the  offences  created  by  s25  of  the  2006  Act  were  re-enacted  with 
consequential amendments in ss4, 5 and 6 of the 2010 Act.

5.50  Section 4 provides that it is an offence for a person with an improper intention to have in 
their possession or under their control an identity document that is false and that they know 
or  believe  to  be  false,  an  identity  document  that  was  improperly  obtained  and  that  they 
know or believe to have been improperly obtained, or an identity document that relates to 
someone else.469

467 ‘False’ for the purposes of Part I of the Act is defined in s9. ‘Instrument’ for the purposes of Part I of the Act is 
defined in s8 
468 ‘Intention to induce prejudice’ is defined in s10 
469 ‘Improper intention’ is defined in s4(2) as the intention of using the document for establishing personal information 
about oneself or the intention of allowing or inducing another to use if for establishing, ascertaining or verifying 
personal information about oneself or anyone else. ‘Personal information’ for the purposes of ss4 and 5 is defined in s8 

1934

APPENDICES5.51  Section 5 provides that it is an offence for a person with the prohibited intention to make 
or have in their possession or under their control, any apparatus which, to their knowledge, 
is or has specially been designed or adopted for the making of false identity documents or 
any article or material which, to the person’s knowledge, is or has been specially designed or 
adapted to be used in the making of such documents.470

5.52  Section 6 provides that it is an offence for a person, without reasonable excuse, to have in 
their possession or under their control, (a) an identity document that is false, (b) an identity 
document that was improperly obtained, (c) an identity document that relates to someone 
else, (d) any apparatus which, to the person’s knowledge, is or has been specially designed 
or adopted for the making of false identity documents, or (e) any article or material which, 
to the person’s knowledge, is or has been specially designed or adapted to be used in the 
making of such documents.

Impersonation of a police officer

5.53 

It is an offence contrary to the Police Act 1996 s90(2) for someone who is not a police officer 
to wear any article of police uniform, which includes distinctive badges, marks and documents 
where it gives that person an appearance so resembling a member of a police force that is 
calculated to deceive, s90 Police Act 1996.

5.54  The offence is punishable on summary conviction with a fine not exceeding level 3.

Gaining access to a prohibited place

5.55  Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1920 creates an offence where a person, for the purpose 
of gaining admission or of assisting any other person to gain admission to a prohibited place, 
or for any other purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State:471

(a) 

uses  or  wears  without  lawful  authority,  any  naval,  military,  air-force,  police  or 
other official uniform, or any uniform so nearly resembling the same as to be 
calculated to deceive, or falsely represents themselves to be a person who is or 
has been entitled to use or wear any uniform;

(b)  orally or in writing in any declaration or application, or in any document signed by 
them or on their behalf, knowingly makes or connives at the making of any false 
statement or any omission;
tampers  with  any  passport  or  naval,  military,  air-force,  police  or  other  official 
pass, permit, certificate, licence, or other document of a similar character, or has 
in their possession any forged, altered or irregular official document;

(c) 

(d)  personates  or  falsely  represents  themselves  to  be  a  person  holding,  or  in  the 
employment of a person holding office under His/Her Majesty or to be a person 
to whom an official document or secret official code word or pass word has been 
duly  issued  or  communicated,  or  with  intent  to  obtain  any  official  document, 
secret  official  code  word  or  pass  word,  for  themselves  of  another,  knowingly 
makes any false statement;

470 ‘Prohibited intention’ is defined in s5(2) as the intention that the person or another will make a false identity 
document, and that that document will beused by somebody for establishing, ascertaining or verifying personal 
information about a person 
471 ss3, 12 of the Official Secrets Act 1920

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials(e)  uses or has in their possession or control, without the authority of the Government 
Department or the authority concerned, any die, seal, stamp of or belonging to, 
or used made or provided by any Government Department, or by any diplomatic, 
naval, military or air force authority or any die, seal or stamp so nearly resembling 
any such die, seal or stamp as to be calculated to deceive or any counterfeits of 
such die, seal or stamp.

s55 DPA – unlawful obtaining of personal data

5.56  Section  55  of  the  Data  Protection  Act  may  also  cover  blagging  offences  where  conduct 
amounts to a person knowingly or recklessly without the consent of the data controller, (a) 
obtaining or disclosing personal data or the information contained in personal data, or (b) 
procuring the disclosure to another person of the information contained in personal data. 
This offence is dealt with above at paragraph 4.59.

Making payments to public officials in order to obtain information

5.57  Making payments to public officials in order to obtain information may amount to an offence 
under the Bribery Act 2010 (if committed after 1 July 2011), the common law of bribery, or 
under the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 and 1916 (in relation to acts prior to July 2011), 
and may give rise to misconduct in public office on the part of public officers.

5.58  Prior to the implementation of the Bribery Act 2010, statute and common law laid down 
offences in relation to bribery. The principal legislation dealing with corruption was contained 
in the Public Bodies Corruption Practices Act 1889 and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, 
which were supplemented by the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916. The 1889 Act concerned 
corruption  in  public  bodies  and  local  government  and  criminalised  the  giving  or  receipt  
of  money,  gifts  of  other  consideration  in  relation  to  a  person  in  the  employment  of  the  
Crown, any government department or public body.472 “Corruptly” for the purposes of the 
1889 Act referred to purposefully doing any act which the law forbids as tending to corrupt 
and would likely include improper gifts, payments or other inducements offered to a councillor 
or other officers or employees of a public authority.473 It was no defence for the recipient to 
prove that their acceptance of a corrupt gift failed to influence them in the performance of 
his duties.474

5.59  The 1906 Act is concerned with the corruption of agents, whether agents of public bodies or 
otherwise.475 Section 1 sets out that it is an offence if any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, 
agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person, for themselves or any other person, 
any gift or consideration as an inducement for doing or forbearing to do any act in relation to 
their principal’s affairs or business.

5.60  Bribery and corruption committed abroad was criminalised by the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and 
Security Act 2001, s109. Further, prior to the implementation of the Bribery Act 2010, it was 
an offence at common law to bribe the holder of a public officer, or for an office holder to 
accept such a bribe.476

APPENDICES5.61  The  Bribery  Act  2010  was  brought  into  force  on  1  July  2011  and  sets  out  a  consolidated 
scheme for bribery offences in the UK and abroad. Section 17 and Schedule 2 abolish the 
common law offences of bribery but leave intact the common law offence of misconduct in 
public office. New offences are created by ss1, 2, 6 and 7 of the Bribery Act 2010. The Act 
does not have retrospective effect, and acts undertaken prior to the commencement date 
will be charged under the old law.

5.62  The key offences in the Act are ss1 (bribery of another person) and 2 (being bribed). The 

offences apply equally to the public and private sector.

5.63  Section 1 of the Act provides that a person is guilty of an offence in one of two cases. The 
first case is where a person offers, promises or gives a financial or other advantage to another 
person and the person intends the advantage to, i) induce a person to perform improperly a 
relevant function or activity or ii) to reward a person for the improper performance of such a 
function or activity.477 The second case is where a person offers, promises or gives a financial 
or other advantage to another person, and  knows or believes that the acceptance of the 
advantage would itself constitute the improper performance of a relevant function or activity.

5.64 

In relation to the first case it does not matter whether the person to whom the advantage 
is offered, promised or given, is the same person as the person who is to perform, or has 
performed, the function or activity concerned, s1(4). In the first and second cases, it does 
not matter whether the advantage is offered, promised or given by the person directly or 
through a third party: s1(5). It is not a requirement of either of these offences that the bribe 
or advantage is actually accepted.

5.65  Section 2 provides that a person is guilty of an offence if one of a further three cases applies.

5.66  The third case is where the person requests, agrees to receive or accepts a financial or other 
advantage intending that, in consequence, a relevant function or activity should be performed 
improperly by themselves or another. The fourth case is where a person requests, agrees to 
receive or accepts a financial or other advantage, and the request, agreement or acceptance 
itself constitutes the improper performance by a person of a relevant function or activity. 
The fifth case is where a person requests, agrees to receive or accepts a financial or other 
advantage as a reward for the improper performance, whether by themselves or another, of 
a relevant function or activity. The sixth case is where, in anticipation of, or in consequence 
of a person requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting a financial or other advantage, a 
relevant function or activity is performed improperly by the person or another at the person’s 
request or with the person’s assent or acquiescence.478

5.67  The Director of the Serious Fraud Office and the DPP published joint guidance on 30 March 
2011 on the approach to prosecutorial decision-making in respect of offences under ss1,2, 6 
and 7 of the Act.

477 ‘Relevant function or activity’ is defined in ss3, 4 and 5 of the Bribery Act 2010, and broadly includes the following: 
any function of a public nature, activity connected with a business, performed in the course of a person’s employment 
or performed on behalf of a body of persons (whether corporate or incorporate) and the person performing the function 
or activity is expected to perform it in good faith, is expected to perform it impartially or is in a position of trust by virtue 
of performing it 
478 ss2(2)-(5)

Appendix 4 | Legal MaterialsMisconduct in public office

5.68  The common law offence of misconduct in public office remains an offence and has not been 
extinguished  by  the  Bribery  Act  2010.  The  offence  was  explained  by  the  Court  of  Appeal 
in  A-G  Ref  (No  3  of  2003),  which  held  that  the  offence  of  misfeasance  in  public  office  is 
committed by a public officer acting as such who wilfully neglects to perform his or her duty 
and/or wilfully misconducts themselves to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the 
public’s trust in the office holder, without reasonable excuse or justification. Wilful in this 
context involves “deliberately doing something which is wrong, knowing it to be wrong or 
with reckless indifference as to whether it is wrong or not”.479 As to the requirement that the 
neglect of duty or the misconduct must amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office 
holder, the court said that threshold is a high one and a mistake, even a serious one, will not 
suffice.480

5.69 

In respect of cases involving police officers, the Court of Appeal reviewed the authorities on 
sentencing in A-G Ref (No 30 of 2010) (R v Bohannan), and concluded that the authorities 
illustrated  four  important  principles:  punishment  and  deterrence  were  always  important 
because  police  officers  must  be  deterred  from  misconduct  and  the  public  must  see  that 
condign  punishment  will  be  imposed  on  police  officers  who  betray  the  trust  in  them,  an 
incentive, money or otherwise, increases the seriousness of the offence, misconduct that 
assists organised criminals to keep ahead of law enforcement agencies increases the gravity 
of offences, misconduct that impact on police operations moves an offence into a different 
category of gravity.481

5.70  The offence can involve an improper act or omission, but the misconduct must be wilful and 
the offender must be a public officer acting as such.482 Public officers include magistrates, 
judges, registrars, council officials, ministers, civil servants and police officers.

5.71  For example in A-G’s Ref (No 1 of 2007), a police officer was convicted of misconduct in public 
office for misusing the Police National Computer in order to supply confidential information 
to a known criminal.483

5.72  The principal legislation dealing with corruption prior to the Bribery Act 2010 was the Public 
Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889, the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, and the Prevention 
of Corruption Act 1916.

Handling stolen goods

5.73  Section 22 of the Theft Act 1968 sets out that a person handles stolen goods if (otherwise 
than in the course of the stealing) know or believing them to be stolen goods they dishonestly 
receive the goods, or dishonestly undertake or assist in their retention, removal, disposal or 
realisation by or for the benefit of another person or if they arrange to do so. Section 34(2)
(b) defines “goods” as including money and every other description of property except land, 
and includes things severed from the land by stealing.

5.74  Dishonesty in this context bears the same meaning as fraud or deception in the case of Ghosh. 
For a charge of handling stolen goods to be made out, it must be proved that the defendant

480 Ibid, at para 56

482 Wilful misconduct involves “deliberately doing something which is wrong, knowing it to be wrong or with reckless 
indifference as to whether it is wrong or not”, para 28. The threshold  is a high  one, requiring  conduct  so far below 
acceptable standards as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder. A mistake, even a serious one, 
will not suffice, para 56 
483 [2007] 2 Cr App R (S) 544

APPENDICESknew  the  goods  were  stole.  or  correctly  believed  they  were  and  this  state  of  mind  must 
correspond with the time when the handling takes place.

Restrictions on content of publications
Official Secrets Act 1989

5.75  Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989 contains an offence relating to the disclosure of 
information  and  material  by  a  person  who  is  or  has  been  a  member  of  the  security  and 
intelligence services or has been notified they are subject to the OSA 1989. Section 2 creates 
the offence of damaging disclosure of defence information, s3 relates to damaging disclosure 
of material relating to international relations or other confidential information, documents or 
articles which were obtained from a State other than the UK or an international organisation, 
and s4 creates an offence of disclosure of information relevant to criminal investigations.484

5.76  The House of Lords in R v Shayler held that ss1, 3 and 4 do not entitle a defendant prosecuted 
under those provisions to be acquitted if they show that it was, or that they believed that 
it  was,  in  the  public  or  national  interest  to  make  the  disclosure  in  question  or  if  the  jury 
concluded that it might have been, or the defendant might have believed it to have been 
in the public or national interest to make the disclosure in question.485 Lord Bingham held 
that:486

“It is in my opinion plain, giving sections 1(1)(a) and 4(1) and 3(a) their natural and 
ordinary meaning and reading them in the context of the OSA 1989 as a whole, that 
a  defendant  prosecuted  under  these  sections  is  not  entitled  to  be  acquitted  if  he 
shows that it was or that he believed that it was in the public or national interest to 
make the disclosure in question or if the jury conclude that it may have been or that 
the defendant may have believed it to be in the public or national interest to make 
the disclosure in question. The sections impose no obligation on the prosecution to 
prove that the disclosure was not in the public interest and give the defendant no 
opportunity to show that the disclosure was in the public interest or that he thought 
it was. The sections leave no room for doubt, and if they did the 1988 white paper 
quoted  above,  which  is  a  legitimate  aid  to  construction,  makes  the  intention  of 
Parliament clear beyond argument.”

5.77  Of particular relevance to journalists is s5, which sets out offences relating to disclosure of 
information resulting from unauthorised disclosures. Section 5(2) provides that a person will 
be guilty of an offence where the person into whose possession the information, document 
or  article  has  come,  discloses  it  without  lawful  authority,  knowing  or  having  reasonable 
cause to believe that it is a protected disclosure under the provisions of the OSA, and the 
material has come into their possession either directly or indirectly by reason of disclosure by 
a crown servant or government contractors without lawful authority, or disclosed in breach 
of confidence.487 Section 5(2) applies to any information, document, or other article which 
is  protected  against  disclosure  by  ss1-4.  An  offence  is  not  committed  under  s5(2)  unless 

484 Damaging disclosure is defined in s3(2) of the OSA 1989. Ss2-4 prevent disclosure of information by a person who 
is or has been a crown servant or government contractor who makes a damaging disclosure of defence information, 
international relations information or information relevant to criminal investigations 
485 [2003] 1 AC 247 
486 At para 20 
487 s5(5) defines a protected disclosure as being a disclosure which (a) relates to security or intelligence, defence or 
international relations within the meaning of ss1,2,3 or 3(1)(b) or is information or a document or article to which s4 
applies 

1939

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialsthe disclosure is damaging and the person makes it knowing or having reasonable cause to 
believe that it would be damaging, s5(3).

5.78  Further,  it  is  an  offence  contrary  to  s5(6)  of  the  Official  Secrets  Act  1989  for  a  person  to 
disclose  any  information,  document  or  other  article  which  they  know  or  have  reasonable 
cause to believe to have come into their possession as a result of a contravention of s1 of the 
Official Secrets Act 1911.

Contempt of court

5.79  The law of criminal contempt of court is found in both the common law and the Contempt 
of Court Act 1981. In broad terms, criminal contempt can take one of two forms, contempt 
in the face of the court (for example a refusal to give evidence), or indirect contempt (for 
example publication of an article on a forthcoming trial). The law of contempt is based on the 
principle that the courts cannot and will not permit interference with the due administration 
of justice.488

5.80  At common law, contempt of court is an act or omission calculated to interfere with the due 
administration  of  justice:  Att-  Gen  v  Times  Newspapers  Ltd  [1992]  1  AC  191.  Examples  of 
contempt of relevance include as follows.

5.81 

It is contempt to publish material that is so defamatory of a judge or a court as to be likely 
to interfere with the due administration of justice by seriously lowering the authority of the 
judge or the court: R v Gray.489 It is only in exceptional cases that this jurisdiction will be 
exercised and this species of contempt was described as virtually obsolescent by Lord Diplock 
in Secretary of State for Defence v Guardian Newspapers Ltd.490 The offence will be made out 
where the publication is intentional, the article is calculated to undermine the authority of 
the court and the defence of fair criticism in good faith is inapplicable, see Ahnee v DPP.491 It 
has been acknowledged that restrictions on the freedom of expression will be necessary in 
some circumstances in order to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary within 
the meaning of Article 10(2) of the ECHR: see Munby J in Att-Gen v Harris.492

5.82 

It  is  also  an  offence  to  publish  matter  calculated  to  prejudice  a  fair  trial.  To  establish  the 
offence of contempt at common law it must be established that a) the publication of the 
material created a real risk of prejudice to the due administration of justice, and b) that the 
material was published with the specific intention of causing such a risk.493

5.83  The question is whether the publication created a substantial risk that the court of justice 
would be substantially impeded or prejudiced. The court must assess the risk of prejudice by 
looking at the prejudice from the date of publication. It is no defence that no prejudice was 
in fact caused, for example because there was no possibility that jurors saw the publication.

5.84  Contempt of court in this context may include publishing material which may prejudice a jury 
against an accused, publishing the photograph of a person charged with an offence where it is 
reasonably clear that the identity of the accused has arisen or may arise, by revealing matters

APPENDICESwhich might be inadmissible in evidence and which may influence jurors or by sensational 
and misleading coverage of a trial.494

5.85  There is no common law power to make an order postponing the publication of a report of 
proceedings conducted in open court. This power is conferred by statute in some instances, 
for example the Contempt of Court Act 1981, the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, and 
the Administration of Justice Act 1960, s12.

Contempt of Court Act 1981

5.86  The Act has a twofold purpose – to remove liability for technical but venial contempt and to 
clarify the balance between a fair trial and a free press.495 The Act restricts limited liability for 
contempt under the “strict liability rules”, deems specific conduct to be contempt of court 
and makes provision for penalties for contempt.

5.87  The strict liability rule imposed by the Act in s1, i.e. that conduct can be treated as contempt 
of court without requiring intent to interfere with the course of justice, applies to publications 
which create a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will 
be seriously impeded or prejudiced, where the proceedings in question are active at the time 
of publication.496

5.88  The application of the strict liability rule to publications was considered by the Court of Appeal 
in Att-Gen v News Group Newspapers Ltd, which noted that there was a need to balance the 
public  interest in general discussion  being permitted and to ask whether the proceedings 
sought to be protected were sufficiently proximate to the apprehended publication to require 
protection.497  In  Re  Lonrho  plc  the  House  of  Lords  explained  that  the  question  whether  a 
particular  publication,  in  relation  to  particular  legal  proceedings  which  are  active,  creates 
a substantial risk that the course of justice will be impeded or prejudiced by a publication 
must depend primarily on whether the publication will bring influence to bear which is likely 
to divert the proceedings in some way from the course which they would otherwise have 
followed.498

5.89  The risk that has to be assessed is that which was created by the publication of the allegedly 
offending matter at the time when it was published. The Court should look at each publication 
separately as at the date of publication and consider the likelihood that it would be read by 
a potential juror, the likely impact of the article on an ordinary reader at the time of the 
publication and its residual impact on a notional juror at the time of the trial.

5.90  Section  2(2)  sets  out  two  separate  risks,  impede  and  prejudice.499  Impede  means  to  slow 
down, delay, hinder or obstruct. Prejudice is to say or do that which is detrimental or injurious 
to the interest of that thing or person.500

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials5.91 

In  Her  Majesty’s  Attorney  General  v  MGN  Ltd  and  another,  the  Divisional  Court  heard 
proceedings for contempt brought against the publishers of the Daily Mirror and The Sun 
newspapers in respect of articles published relating to Mr Christopher Jefferies. Mr Jefferies 
was arrested on suspicion of the murder of Joanne Yates in December 2011 and subsequently 
released from police bail without charge. Another man was subsequently charged with the 
murder of Miss Yates. The Divisional Court considered whether the newspapers were guilty 
of contempt on the basis that the criminal proceedings in which Mr Jefferies was involved 
at  the  date  of  publication  were  at  serious  risk  of  being  prejudiced  and/or  impeded.  The 
Divisional Court noted that the vilification of a suspect under arrest readily falls within the 
protective ambit of s2(2), as such publication may discourage witnesses from coming forward 
to provide information helpful to the suspect, and that in this case the impact of the articles 
on any potential defence witnesses would have been extremely damaging to Mr Jefferies. 
The impugned articles were held to have created substantial risks to the course of justice and 
to constitute contempt under the strict liability rule. The Daily Mirror was subsequently fined 
£50,000 and The Sun £18,000.501

5.92  More recently, in Her Majesty’s Attorney General v Associated Newspapers Ltd and MGN Ltd 
the Divisional Court determined that the publication of material withheld from the jury in 
relation to the activities of Levi Bellfield but published after the jury had convicted him of 
kidnap and murder of Milly Dowler but while it was continuing to deliberate in relation to an 
outstanding charge of attempted kidnapping of another girl created “a separate and distinct 
risk of serious prejudice” which was substantial and over and above that which had been the 
consequence of television broadcasts.502

5.93  Sections 3 and 5 set out defences in respect of innocent publication/distribution and fair and 
accurate reports of proceedings respectively. Section 3 provides that a publisher is not guilty 
of contempt of court under the strict liability standard if, at the time of publication, having 
taken all reasonable care, they do not know and have no reason to suspect that relevant 
proceedings are active; and that a distributor of the publication is not guilty of the offence if, 
at the time of distribution, having taken all reasonable care, they do not know that it contains 
such matter and have no reason to suspect that it is likely to do so. Section 4 provides that a 
person is not guilty of contempt of court under strict liability in respect of a fair and accurate 
report of legal proceedings held in public, published contemporaneously and made in good 
faith. Section 5 provides that a publication made as or as part of a discussion in good faith of 
public affairs or other matters of general public interest is not to be treated as a contempt of 
court under the strict liability rule if the risk of impediment or prejudice to particular legal 
proceedings is merely incidental to the discussion.

5.94  Section 6(a) preserves any defences available at common law; for example fair and accurate 
report of proceedings of a public body, R v Payne and Cooper.503 Section 6(b) clarifies that 
no one can be found guilty of contempt who would not have been found guilty under the 
common law prior to the 1981 Act.

501 [2011] EWHC 2383. The Divisional Court held that it was irrelevant that Mr Jefferies had successfully pursued a civil 
remedy for damages for defamation and that damages had been agreed with an apology to be made to him. Further, it 
was an aggravating feature of the case that the Attorney General had given a warning of the risks to the administration 
of justice and the Court found it impossible to accept that no one in either newspaper knew that the warning had been 
given, or understood its terms

APPENDICES5.95  Any proceedings for contempt of court under the 1981 Act require the consent of the Attorney 
General, or for the proceedings to be instituted on the motion of a court having jurisdiction 
to deal with it.

5.96  Pursuant to s4(2) of the Act, the court has the power to order that the publication of any 
report of proceedings or any part of the proceedings be postponed for a period the court 
thinks necessary where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice 
to  the  administration  of  justice  in  those  proceedings  or  in  other  proceedings  pending  or 
imminent. The court has a discretion to hear representations from the press regarding the 
making of an order under s4(2), although it has been held that it would generally be right 
to hear from the press who represent the public interest in publicity which the court has to 
take into  account  in  performing  the  necessary  balancing  exercise.504  The  relevant  practice 
direction is Practice Direction (Criminal Proceedings: Consolidation). Para I.3 notes that when 
considering whether to make an order under s4(2) it is likely that the court will wish to hear 
from representatives of the press.505

5.97  All orders made under s4(2) must include: a) the precise scope of the order, b) the time at 

which it shall cease to have effect, and c) the specific purpose for which it was made.506

5.98 

In ex parte MGN Ltd Lord Judge CJ summarised the principles as follows. The first question 
is  whether  the  reporting  would  give  rise  to  a  not  insubstantial  risk  of  prejudice  to  the 
administration of justice. The second question is whether an order made under s4(2) would 
eliminate that risk. If not, there would be no necessity to impose such a ban. If the order 
would achieve the objective of eliminating the risk the court has to consider whether the risk 
could satisfactorily be overcome by less restrictive measures. Third, even if there is no way of 
eliminating the perceived risk of prejudice, it does not follow that an order necessarily had 
to be made – the court’s approach should be that unless it is necessary to impose an order 
it is necessary not to impose one and it if is necessary to impose an order at all it must go no 
further than necessary. A section 4(2) order should be a last resort.507

5.99  Section 4(2) is designed to enable the court to postpone the reporting of proceedings where 
the publication during the course of proceedings would prejudice those proceedings. The 
need for postponement cannot extend beyond the proceedings.508

5.100  The interplay between Article 8 (respect of private and family life) and Article 10 (freedom of 
expression) in this context was analysed by the House of Lords in Re A (a child) (identification: 
restriction  on  publication).509  Lord  Steyn  emphasised  that  full  contemporaneous  reporting 
of criminal trials in progress promotes public confidence in the administration of justice and 
promotes the values of the rule of law. The Court of Appeal in Re Trinity Mirror plc stated that 
it was:510

“impossible to over-emphasise the importance to be attached to the ability of the 
media  to  report  criminal  trials  …  this  represents  the  embodiment  of  the  principle 
of open justice in a free country. An important aspect of the public interest in the 
administration of criminal justice is that the identity of those convicted and sentenced 
for criminal offences should not be concealed”.

Appendix 4 | Legal Materials5.101  The Supreme Court in Re Guardian News and Media stated that the press and law reporters 
should ordinarily be permitted to name litigants or parties to proceedings before the courts, 
although  some  exceptions  had  been  created  by  statute.  In  other  cases  where  anonymity 
might be necessary, the court had to balance Articles 8 and 10.511

5.102  Deliberate breach of reporting restrictions imposed under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 
may constitute contempt of court, irrespective of whether there is any real risk of prejudice.512 
Further contempt of court may be committed in certain circumstances where information 
relating to proceedings before a court sitting in private is published, s12 of Administration of 
Justice Act 1960.

5.103  Section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides that in any case where a court allows 
a name or other matter to be withheld from the public in proceedings before the court, the 
court may give directions prohibiting the publication of that name or matter in connection 
with the proceedings as appear to the court to be necessary for the purpose for which it was 
withheld. The power to grant anonymity is that derived from the common law. A court can 
only exercise its powers under s11 to give directions prohibiting the publication of a name in 
connection with court proceedings if the court first legitimately exercised its power to receive 
evidence of information without it being disclosed to the public.513

5.104  Examples  of  where  anonymity  has  been  granted  include  where  there  is  potential 
embarrassment  arising  out  of  a  medical  condition  or  because  a  witness  fears  violence  or 
reprisals.514  However  financial  damage  or  damage  to  reputation  which  results  from  the 
commencement of court proceedings concerning a person’s business is unlikely to amount to 
special circumstances entitling the court to restrict press reporting.515

5.105  Particular  reporting  restrictions  to  protect  anonymity  for  certain  categories  of  defendant 
are set out in statute. For example, s39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (CYPA) 
provides that a Crown Court or a Magistrates’ Court may make an order protecting a juvenile’s 
anonymity.  This  can  be  contrasted  with  the  youth  court,  where  reporting  restrictions  to 
protect the juvenile’s identity apply automatically (see s49 CYPA). Alleged victims in a case 
involving one of the sexual offences set out in s2 of the Sexual Offences (amendment) Act 
1992 are entitled to anonymity from the point when the allegation has been made. Nothing 
may be published that is likely to lead members of public to identity the alleged victim, and 
this continues for lifetime of the complainant. Section 3 permits a court to lift the restriction 
in certain circumstances, for example where publicity is required by the accused so witnesses 
come  forward  and  the  conduct  of  the  defence  is  likely  to  be  seriously  prejudiced  if  the 
direction not given, or where the trial judge is satisfied that the imposition of the prohibition 
imposes a substantial and unreasonable restriction on the reporting of the proceedings and it 
is in the public interest to relax the restriction.516 Section 46 of the Youth Justice and Criminal 
Evidence  Act  1999  allowsr  a  party  to  make  an  application  for  the  court  to  give  reporting 
directions in relation to a witness order than the accused if the direction is likely to improve 
the quality of the evidence of the witness or their co-operation in the case preparation of any 
party to the proceedings.

APPENDICESOffences involving writing, speech or publication

5.106  The common law offences of publishing an obscene libel, defamatory libel and sedition and 
seditious libel were abolished by s73 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and the old “speech 
crimes”  have  now  been  replaced  by  other  offences,  including  those  under  the  Protection 
from Harassment Act 1997 and the Public Order Act 1986. Other offences relating to writing, 
speech or publication are now set out in the Obscene Publications Act 1959.

Obscene Publications Act 1959

5.107  It is an offence under s2(1) of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 for any person, whether for 
gain or not, to publish an obscene article, or for any person to have an obscene article for 
publication for gain (whether gain to themselves or gain to another).

5.108  Pursuant to s1(2) a person shall be deemed to have an article for publication for gain if with a 
view to such publication they has the article in their ownership, possession or control. Article 
is defined in s1(2) as:

“any description of article containing or embodying matter to be read or look at or 
both, any sound record, and any film or other record of a picture or pictures”.

5.109  An article may be a single item, for example a novel, which must be considered in its totality. 
It may also comprise a number of items, for example a magazine. In the latter case each item 
must be judged individually and it is sufficient if the effect of any one of the items, taken as 
a whole, is to tend to deprave and corrupt. The point was analysed in Anderson [1972] 1 QB 
304 where it was held that a novelist who writes a complete novel and who cannot cut out 
particular passages without destroying the theme of the novel is entitled to have his work 
judged as a whole, but a magazine publisher who has a far wider discretion as to what is 
inserted is to be judged on an item by item basis.

5.110  Publication is defined in s1 of the Act as including where a person (a) distributes, circulates, 
sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting for hire or (b) in the 
case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record, shows, plays or 
projects it, or, where the matter is data stored electronically, transmits that data.

5.111  Obscenity is defined in s1 of the Act as follows:

“if its effect or (where the article comprises two or more distinct items), the effect 
of any one of its items is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprive and corrupt 
persons who are likely, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, to read, see 
or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.”

5.112  The  definition  of  obscenity  goes  further  than  shocking  or  immoral  suggestions,  but  must 

constitute a serious menace.517

5.113  It is a defence under s2(5) to a charge of publishing, for the accused to prove that they have 
not examined the article in respect of which they are charged and have no reasonable cause 
to suspect that it was such that their publication of it would make them liable to be convicted 
of an offence under s2. This provides a limited defence for defendants who acted as innocent 
disseminators of material.518 Where the accused is charged with having publication for gain 

517 See dicta in Knuller v DPP [1973] AC 435 at 456- 457
518 See for example the case of R v Love (1955) 39 Cr.App R. 30 in which the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction of 
a director of a print company who had been absent when a printer order for obscene books had been accepted and he 
had no personal knowledge of the content of the books 

1945

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialspursuant to s1(3)(a) of the Obscene Publications Act 1964 (which is a separate offence) the 
law provides a similar defence, namely that the person had no reasonable cause to suspect 
that it was such that having it would make them liable.

5.114  Section  4  sets  out  a  defence  of  public  good,  namely  where  the  publication  of  the  article 
is justified as being for the public good on the ground that it is in the interests of science, 
literature,  art  or  learning,  or  of  other  objects  of  general  concern.  Whilst  the  publishers’ 
intentions,  namely  whether  the  publication  was  intended  to  educate  or  corrupt,  are  not 
relevant to the offence itself (which looks simply at the effect of the publication), they will be 
relevant to a public good defence.

5.115  The  maximum  penalty  on  indictment  is  five  years’  imprisonment,  a  fine,  or  both;  or  six 

months’ imprisonment or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or both summarily.

The Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955

5.116  The publication of material harmful to children and young persons is rendered an offence 
pursuant to s2 of the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955 and this 
applies  to  any  book,  magazine  or  other  like  work  which  is  of  a  kind  likely  to  fall  into  the 
hands of children or young persons and consists wholly or mainly of stories told in picture 
portraying the commission of crime, acts of violence or cruelty or incidents of a repulsive or 
horrible nature in such a way that the work as a whole would tend to corrupt a child or young 
person into whose hands it might fall.

5.117  The Protection of Children Act 1978 and the Criminal Justice Act 1988 also establish offences 
relating to the making, possession, publication and distribution of indecent images of children.

Protection from Harassment Act 1997

5.118  Section 2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 creates an offence when a person 
pursues a course of conduct which amounts to harassment of another and which they know 
or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other. Harassment is an arrestable offence, 
so that the police can apprehend a person whom they have reasonable grounds to believe has 
committed it. The victim can also bring civil proceedings, including applying for an injunction 
restraining  a  person  from  acting  in  a  manner  which  constitutes  harassment.  If  the  victim 
considers that the harasser has engaged in conduct prohibited by the injunction, a power 
of arrest may be attached to the injunction, breach of which without reasonable excuse is a 
criminal offence.519

5.119  Harassment is defined in s7 as including alarming the person or causing the person distress. 
A  course  of  conduct  must  require  conduct  on  a  least  two  occasions,  either  in  relation  to 
one person or one occasion each in relation to two or more persons. It has been held that 
publication of press article is in law capable of amounting to harassment: Thomas v News 
Group Newspapers Ltd.520 It was common ground before the court in that case that there 
must be some exceptional circumstances which justify sanctions and the restriction on the 
freedom of expression before publications are capable of amounting to harassment.

5.120  In  the  context  of  a  civil  claim  for  harassment  pursuant  to  the  PHA  1997,  the  courts  have 
interpreted Thomas in the following way. For the court to comply with s3 HRA, it must hold 

519 PHA 1997, ss3 and 3A 
520 (2001) The Times, 25 July 2002 

1946

APPENDICESthat a course of conduct in the form of journalistic speech is reasonable under PHA s1(3)(c) 
unless, in the particular circumstances of the case, the course of conduct is so unreasonable 
that it is necessary (in the sense of a pressing social need) and proportionate to prohibit or 
sanction the speech in pursuit of one of the aims listed in Art 10(2), including, in particular, 
the protection of the rights of others under Art 8.521

5.121  It is not only publication itself but news gathering activities which may be caught by s2. For 
example, the attention and investigations of unwelcome reporters and photographers may 
amount to distress and constitute harassment under the Act.

5.122  The powers in the PHA 1997 were increased by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 and 
the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. Section 42 of the 2001 Act gives the police 
powers to give directions to stop harassment of a person in their home, for example where 
there is a scrum of reporters and film crew outside a person’s home. Such directions can be 
to go away, and to stay away for up to three months. It is an offence to act outside a person’s 
home in a way which will cause harassment, alarm or distress to a resident or neighbour, 
for the purpose of persuading a person to do something they are not under any obligation 
to do, or to do something which they are not entitled or required to do (see s42A). SOCA 
added a new offence to the PHA 1997, involving harassment by two or more persons which is 
intended to persuade the victim either to do something which they are not obliged to do, or 
not to do something they are entitled to do, s1(1A).

Public Order Act 1986

5.123  Section 4A, inserted into the Public Order Act 1986 in 1994, provides that:

“A person is guilty of an offence if, with intent to cause a person harassment, alarm 
or distress, he... (b) displays any writing, ... which is threatening, abusive or insulting, 
thereby causing that or another person harassment, alarm or distress”.

5.124  In contrast to the PHA, the Public Order Act requires intent to cause harassment, alarm or 
distress. It has been held that where a person posts an image of another on a website that 
is available to the public, the fact that the subject is unaware of it until shown it by a third 
party does not break the chain of causation, and it would also be immaterial that if at the 
time the harassment, alarm or distress was caused the mage was no longer displayed on the 
website.522

5.125  Section 5 provides for a similar type of offence but does not require intent to cause harassment, 

alarm or distress. This section prohibits the display of:

“any  writing,  sign  or  other  visible  representation  which  is  threatening,  abusive  or 
insulting,  within  the  hearing  or  sight  of  a  person  likely  to  be  caused  harassment, 
alarm or distress thereby”.

5.126  The  relationship  between  s5  and  Article  10  of  the  ECHR  was  summarised  as  follows:  i) 
the starting point is the right to freedom of expression, iii) that right must extend beyond 
protecting people who hold popular, mainstream views so that minority views can be freely 
expressed even if distasteful or offensive to some, and iii) the restrictions in Art 10(2) need 
to be narrowly construed and the justification for invoking the criminal law is the threat to

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialspublic order.523 It is a defence pursuant to s5(3)(c) for the defendant to prove that his conduct 
was reasonable.

5.127  Section  18  creates  an  offence  of  using  words  or  behaviour  or  displaying  written  material 
intending to stir up racial hatred. It provides that a person who uses threatening, abusive or 
insulting words or behaviour or displays any written material which is threatening, abusive or 
insulting is guilty of an offence if he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred or having regard 
to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up.524

5.128  Section 19 creates an offence of publishing or distributing written material stirring up racial 
hatred.  This  section  provides  that  a  person  who  publishes  or  distributes  written  material 
which is threatening, abusive or insulting is guilty of an offence if, (a) they intend thereby to 
stir up racial hatred, or (b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be 
stirred up. References to publication or distribution of written material are to its publication 
or distribution to the public or a section of the public. It must be shown that the material was 
generally accessible to all or available to all, or placed before or offered to the public.

5.129  Part  3A  of  the  Act  contains  provisions  about  offences  involving  the  stirring  up  of  hatred 
against persons on racial grounds, or hatred on grounds of sexual orientation. The thrust of 
the offence contained in s29B is to criminalise the use of threatening words or behaviour or 
display of written material where the defendant intended thereby to stir up religious hatred 
or  hatred  on  the  grounds  of  sexual  orientation.  Section  29C  provides  that  a  person  who 
publishes or distributes written material which is threatening is guilty of an offence is they 
intend thereby to stir up religious hatred or hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation.

5.130  There are provisions for the protection of freedom of expression (as required by the Strasbourg 

cases cited below), including s29JA. This provides that:

“… the discussion or criticism of sexual conduct or practices or the urging of persons 
to refrain from or modify such conduct or practices shall not be taken of itself to be 
threatening or intended to stir up hatred”.

Communications Act 2003

5.131  Section  127(1)  of  the  Act  creates  an  offence  when  a  person  sends  by  means  of  a  public 
electronic  communications  network  a  message  or  other  matter  that  is  grossly  offensive 
or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, or causes any such message or matter 
to be so sent. Section 127(2) creates an offence if, for the purpose of causing annoyance, 
inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, a person sends by means of a public electronic 
communications network, a message that they know to be false, causes such a message to be 
sent, or persistently makes use of a public electronic communications network.

5.132  This section has been recently considered by the Divisional Court in hearing an appeal against 
the conviction of Mr Paul Chambers for sending a public electronic message that was grossly 
offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character contrary to s127(1)(a) and (3) 
of the Communications Act 2003. Mr Chambers, upon hearing that an airport he was due 
to travel from was closed due to adverse weather conditions, posted a message on twitter 
to the effect that the airport had a week to resolve the issue or he would be “blowing the 
airport sky high!!” Mr Chambers was convicted on the basis that the content of the message 
was of a menacing character. The Divisional Court concluded that a tweet was a message sent 

523 Abdul v DPP 175 JP 190 
524 s17 defines racial hatred as hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to colour, race, nationality 
(including citizenship), ethnic or national origin 

1948

APPENDICESby an electronic communications service and thus falls within s127(1) of the Act, however, 
on an objective assessment, the decision of the Crown Court that the tweet constituted or 
include a message of a menacing character was not open to it. The Court held that a message 
which does not create fear or apprehension in those to whom it is communicated, or who may 
reasonably be expected to see it, falls outside the Act for the simple reasons that the message 
lacks menace. The Court considered, obiter, the mental element of the offence and held that 
the offender must have intended the message to be of a menacing character or be aware of, or 
recognise the risk, at the time of sending the message that it may create fear or apprehension 
in  any  reasonable  member  of  the  public  who  reads  or  sees  it.  If  the  sender  intended  the 
message as a joke, it is unlikely that mental element of the offence would be established.

Conspiracy and secondary liability

5.133  In relation to each of the offences identified above there is also potential conspiracy liability 
contrary to s1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 and potential secondary liability (see s8 of the 
Accessories and Abettors Act 1861) or encouraging or assisting an offence (ss44-46 of the 
Serious Crime Act 2007).

6.  Criminal procedure

6.1 

6.2 

Police powers of investigation in relation to journalists
As  a  general  rule,  in  the  event  that  the  police  seek  to  make  inquiries  as  part  of  a  police 
investigation  a  journalist  is  in  the  same  position  as  any  other  member  of  the  public  in 
that  they  are  under  no  general  duty  to  provide  assistance.  In  exceptional  circumstances, 
the police have the power to insist on answers being provided to questions in the context 
of  suspected  breaches  of  s1  of  the  Official  Secrets  Act  1911.525  Further,  investigators  and 
inspectors appointed under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to investigate specific 
allegations in relation to a range of regulatory offences have powers to compel answers from 
interviewees the production of information and documents.526

Police  powers  of  investigation,  including  powers  of  entry  and  search  of  premises,  are 
contained primarily in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). A general power to 
search any premises occupied or controlled by a person who is under arrest for an indictable 
offence can be exercised if a police officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the 
premises contain relevant evidence.527 Once at the premises, a police officer has the power 
to seize anything which they have reasonable grounds for believing they would be authorised 
to search and seize, where it is not reasonably practicable to determine at the time whether 
they do have such authorisation.528 However, these powers are only available once a person 
is under arrest and are not available at a preliminary stage of an investigation. Further, if a 
police officer seizes anything which appears to be excluded material or special procedure 
material (as defined below), this must be returned as soon as reasonably practicable unless it 
cannot be separated from other property it is lawful to retain.529

6.3

protection. In practice, therefore, the police mostly rely on the specific provisions in PACE in 
order to obtain journalistic material, although the statutory powers of search and seizure are 
modified in relation to material held by journalists in circumstances where the information 
sought falls within the definition of “excluded material” or “special procedure material”.

Journalistic material for the purposes of PACE is defined as material acquired or created for 
the purposes of journalism, but only if it is in the possession of a person who acquired it 
or  created  it  for  that  purpose,  and  a  person  will  be  deemed  to  have  acquired  it  for  that 
purpose if it was given to them with the intention that it be used for that purpose.530 The 
purposes of journalism are not defined in the Act, although the Supreme Court has recently 
considered the phrase “purpose of journalism” in the context of the Freedom of Information 
Act in Sugar v British Broadcasting Corporation and the majority held that the phrase should 
be narrowly construed to mean where an immediate object of holding the information is to 
use it for the purpose of journalism.531 This requires a direct link between the holding of the 
information and achievement of its journalistic purposes. The wider ‘dominant purpose’ test 
was rejected.532

Excluded  material  for  the  purpose  of  s11(1)  of  PACE  1984  includes  journalistic  material 
consisting of document or records, if it is held in confidence. The paradigm example of excluded 
material is where a source gives information to a journalist on condition that his identity is 
not  disclosed  in  any  publication  of  the  information.  Excluded  material  generally  does  not 
include film taken by broadcasting crews or photographs, unless obtained in circumstances 
giving rise to a duty of confidence.

Journalistic  material  other  than  that  falling  within  the  definition  of  excluded  material  is 
defined as special procedure material for the purposes of s14 of PACE. Special procedure 
material is excluded from a warrant to search or enter premises issued by a justice of the 
peace, s8(1) PACE.

Section  9(1)  of  PACE  enables  access  to  be  obtained  to  “special  procedure  material”  and 
“excluded material” for the purposes of a criminal investigation, provided that the conditions 
set out in Schedule 1 of the Act are met.

Schedule 1 of PACE permits a constable to apply to a Circuit Judge for a Production Order, or 
in some circumstances a search warrant, where particular access conditions are met.

The first set of access conditions applies to applications for special procedure material and 
only permit a warrant to be granted where:533

(a) 

there  are  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  an  indictable  offence  has  been 
committed;

(b)  material consisting of or including special procedure material (but not excluded 
material) is held at the premises specified in the application or controlled by the 
person named in the application;
that the material is likely to be of substantial value, whether by itself or together 
with other material, to the investigation in connection with which the application 
is made;

APPENDICESthe material is likely to be relevant evidence;

(d) 
(e)  other  methods  of  obtaining  the  special  procedure  material  have  been  tried 

(f) 

without success or have not been tried as they would be bound to fail; and
it is in the public interest to produce or allow access to the material, having regard 
to the benefit of the investigation if the material is obtained and the circumstances 
under which the person holds the material.

6.10  The second set out access conditions which applies to excluded matter provide that an order 

may be made where:534

(a) 

(b) 

there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is material which consists 
of or includes excluded or special procedure material on the premises owned by 
the person named in the application, and/or premises occupied or controlled by 
the person set out in the application;
a warrant would have been appropriate and available, but for the repeal by s9(2) 
of PACE of all provisions allowing warrants to be issued for such material.

6.11  Examples of circumstances in which a power to issue a search warrant in respect of an offence 
being investigated prior to PACE coming into force include investigations into stolen goods 
and offences under the Official Secrets Act. It is therefore unlikely that journalistic material 
would  be  sought  pursuant  to  the  second  condition  and  case  law  indicates  that  journalist 
material is generally sought by the police under paragraph 2 of Schedule 1. It can be observed 
that there is very limited scope for obtaining access to excluded material.

6.12  Again, for the protection of journalistic privilege, the procedure for obtaining a production 
order is fairly rigorous. An application must be made to a Circuit Judge and notice must be 
given to the person in possession of the material.535 A judge may only make an order if satisfied 
that one of the access conditions is fulfilled and the judge must exercise their powers with 
great care and caution and must be shown such material as is necessary to enable them to be 
satisfied before making the order, and told of anything which may weigh against the making 
of the order.536 The judge must determine whether the conditions are met. It is not sufficient 
to simply consider whether the decision of the constable that the conditions were met is 
reasonable. The judge retains discretion to refuse to grant the order, even if the necessary 
condition is satisfied, and this permits the possibility that in an appropriate case, the view 
may be taken that there is a lack of proportionality between what might be gained to the 
investigation as against stifling public debate.537 Once an order has been made, it is subject to 
challenge by way of judicial review.

6.13  On a number of occasions the police have used these powers to obtain orders requiring the 
press to hand over film and photographs of demonstrations or events giving rise to public order 
offences. These provisions have been recently analysed in the case of R (on the application of 
British Sky Broadcasting Ltd and others) v Chelmsford Crown Court.538 The claimants included 
BSkyB, ITN, BBC, an independent production company and a freelance video journalist who 
had filmed for news purposes the Dale Farm evictions of travellers. Essex Police sought and 
were granted orders for production of footage on the basis that the footage would be of

Appendix 4 | Legal Materialssubstantial value to police investigations into offences of violent disorder and other offences. 
The  orders  were  challenged  by  way  of  judicial  review.  The  Divisional  Court  held  that  full 
account must be taken of Article 10 considerations when determining an application under 
Sch 1.539

6.14  The  court  further  noted  that  there  was  a  need  to  balance  the  competing  public  interest 
considerations in the context of journalistic material and, whilst it is difficult to dispute that 
there is a real public interest in tracing any of those persons who were involved in public 
disorder or violence, that had to be set against the level of interference with the Claimants’ 
Article 10 rights inherent in the production orders made. Having regard to the terms of Art 
10(2), it was for the Essex Police to demonstrate that this degree of interference and the wide 
scope of the production sought was necessary and proportionate because of the “substantial 
value”  attaching  to  the  relevant  material  in  the  context  of  the  investigation.  On  the  facts 
there was insufficient evidence to justify this conclusion.540

6.15 

It was noted that whilst the statutory provisions allowing disclosure orders can be of great 
value in tracing those responsible for public order and other offences and thus in serving 
the  public  interest,  the  importance  of  establishing  the  access  conditions  should  never  be 
underestimated. There is a burden to be discharged and disclosure orders against the media, 
intrusive  as  they  are,  can  never  be  granted  as  a  formality.  There  must  at  least  be  cogent 
evidence as to; (i) what the footage sought is likely to reveal, (ii) how important such evidence 
would be to carrying out the investigation, and (iii) why it is necessary and proportionate 
to  order  the  intrusion  by  reference  to  other  potential  sources  of  information.  In  these 
proceedings, the burden was not discharged.541

6.16  Other material that does not fall within the definition of journalistic material that attracts the 
categorisation of “excluded” or “special procedure” material, is subject to normal procedures 
for search warrants and can be granted by a magistrate without any right on the part of the 
media to object and without a public interest test.

6.17  An  issue  of  some  importance  is  whether  “journalistic  material”  includes  material  which 
has been obtained with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose, or, put another way, 
whether the protections set out in PACE for “excluded” or “special procedure” material still 
apply where the material has been acquired in furtherance of a crime.542

6.18  PACE includes an express caveat in the context of legal professional privilege that items held 
with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose are not subject to legal privilege, however 
there  is  currently  no  equivalent  provision  for  journalistic  material.543  There  is  no  direct 
authority which addresses the issue of whether journalistic material will not be held under 
an obligation of confidence where it has been obtained in the context of criminal behaviour, 
although the case law on the duty of confidentiality more generally acknowledges that the 
public  interest  in  protecting  confidences  can  be  outweighed  in  certain  circumstances,  For

542 This issue is comprehensively and usefully dealt with in the submissions of Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey 
dated 12 July 2012. These are considered in the context of recommendations concerning the relationship between the 
press and the police
543 Section 10(2). It is also noted that Schedule 5 of the Terrorism Act 2005 includes provision to apply for an order 
for excluded or special procedure material (as defined in PACE) on the basis either that the material is likely to be of 
substantial value to a terrorist investigation and there are reasonable grounds for believing it is in the public interest 
that material should be produced or access to it given having regard to the benefit likely to accrue to the terrorist 
investigation and the circumstances in which the person has any of the material in his possession, custody or control

currently  unclear  whether  material  obtained  in  the  context  of  criminal  behaviour  by  a 
journalist would attract the protections of Schedule 1 by virtue of being excluded or special 
procedure material.

Introduction
This Annex should be read as a whole. In particular, it should be noted that:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

the references are set out in alphabetical order by the name of the witness. No particular 
inference should, therefore, be drawn from the order in which they are presented;
in  most  cases,  the  facts  upon  which  the  conclusion  is  based  in  Part  I  Chapter  8  are 
readily apparent from the terms of the criticism itself and the evidential references, 
and are not separately stated at length;
some of the conclusions overlap and the supporting facts and evidence are not always 
set out more than once;
the evidence referenced in support of each conclusion is intended to be representative 
rather  than  exhaustive,  especially  in  cases  where  the  Inquiry  received  significant 
volumes of similar evidence.

1.2 

It is the cumulative effect of the evidence cited, taken together and looked at as a whole, 
which supports the conclusion.

2.  Referencing
2.1 

The full title of each witness is given in the first reference to their evidence. Witness statements, 
exhibits and transcripts are identified by a hyperlink to their location on the Inquiry website, 
www.levesoninquiry.org.uk.

2.2  When reference is made to a witness statement, the numbering system of that document, 
i.e. paragraph or page number, has been used. For example, page 12 of the Supplementary 
Witness Statement of Mr Alan Rusbridger is cited as follows:

Mr  Alan  Rusbridger  p12,  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/ 
01/Supplementary-Statement-of-Alan-Rusbridger.pdf

A reference to a page in a witness statement does not necessarily imply that the content of 
the entire page is cited as support for the related fact. Where available, paragraph numbers 
have been used.

2.3  When reference has been made to a passage in a transcript, the passage is identified in the 
form [page number]/[line number]. The page number is a reference to pages of the transcript, 
not to pages of the pdf document. There are 4 transcript pages per page of the document. For 
example, the passage from page 19, line 5 to page 21, line 4 in the transcript of the afternoon 
of 23 April 2012, during Mr Evgeny Lebedev’s evidence is cited as follows:

relationship between politicians and national 
Newspapers

Conclusion
(i)	

The	political	parties	of	UK	national	government,	and	of	UK	official	opposition,	have	had	
or	developed	too	close	a	relationship	with	the	press.	This	conclusion	relates	at	least	to	
the	period	of	the	last	thirty	to	thirty-five	years.	Although	aspects,	and	the	problematic	
nature,	 of	 this	 relationship	 have	 fluctuated	 over	 time,	 there	 has	 been	 a	 perceptible	
increase	in	proximity	which	has	not	been	in	the	public	interest.
The	relationship	between	the	press	and	the	politicians	has	been	too	close	in	the	following	
principal	respects:
a.	

politicians	have	spent	a	disproportionate	amount	of	time,	attention	and	resource	
on	 this	 relationship	 in	 comparison	 to,	 and	 at	 the	 expense	 of,	 other	 legitimate	
claims	in	relation	to	their	conduct	of	public	affairs;
in	 conducting	 their	 relationship	 with	 the	 press,	 politicians	 have	 not	 always	
maintained	with	adequate	rigour	appropriate	boundaries	between	the	conduct	of	
public	affairs	on	the	one	hand	and	their	private	or	personal	interests	on	the	other;

APPENDICES4.  The consequences of excessive proximity

Conclusion
(iv)	

b.	

In	 consequence	 of,	 or	 associated	 with,	 this	 relationship	 of	 inappropriate	 closeness,	
politicians	have	conducted	themselves,	contrary	to	the	public	interest,	so	as	to:
a.	

place	 themselves	 in	 a	 position	 in	 which	 they	 risked	 becoming	 vulnerable	 to	
unaccountable	influences,	in	a	manner	which	was	potentially	in	conflict	with	their	
responsibilities	in	relation	to	the	conduct	of	public	affairs;
permit,	 accept	 or	 encourage	 the	 power	 and	 dominance	 of	 certain	 voices	 in	
the	 press,	 to	 the	 impoverishment	 of	 public	 debate	 and	 the	 formulation	 and	
implementation	of	public	policy;

c.	 miss	a	number	of	clear	opportunities	decisively	to	address,	and	persistently	fail	to	
respond	more	generally	to	public	concern	about,	the	culture	practices	and	ethics	
of	the	press;
seek	to	control	and	manipulate	the	supply	of	news	and	information	to	the	public	
in	return	for	favourable	treatment	by	sections	of	the	press,	to	a	degree	and	by	
means	going	beyond	the	fair	and	reasonable	partisan	conduct	of	public	debate,	
particularly	bearing	in	mind	the	responsibilities	of	parties	in	government.

5.  The consequences on public confidence in and 

the public perception of the relationship between 
politicians and the press

Conclusion
(v)	 A	combination	of	these	factors	has	contributed	to	a	lessening	of	public	confidence	in	the	
conduct	of	public	affairs,	including	by	giving	rise	to	legitimate	perceptions	and	concerns	
that	 politicians	 and	 the	 press	 have	 traded	 power	 and	 influence	 in	 ways	 which	 are	
contrary	to	the	public	interest.	These	perceptions	and	concerns	are	particularly	acute,	
inevitably,	in	relation	to	the	conduct	by	politicians	in	government	of	public	policy	issues	
in	relation	to	the	press	itself.

The matters set out below are in addition to the matters already set out above in this notice 
insofar as they are relevant to public confidence and public perceptions.

Appendix 5 | Evidence Relevant to the Generic Conclusions on the Relationship Between Politicians and the Press: Part I Chapter 8Sir John Major:
•  para  32,  that  party  political  appointees  as  press  secretaries  and  as  special  advisers 
have  meant  that  the  word  of  the  government  spokesman  is  less  likely  to  be  accepted 
as  dispassionate  and  accurate,  and  creates  an  invidious  position  if  the  person  returns 
to journalism having had access to sensitive material, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/
wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Witness-Statement-of-Sir-John-Major.pdf

•  18/9-20/13, that making political appointments to government communications was a 
retrograde  step,  and  that  the  politicisation  of  government  information  services  meant 
the  news  is  not  presented  accurately  and  fairly,  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2012/06/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-12-June-2012.pdf

Lord Mandelson:
•  pp3 and 4, in an extract from The	Blair	Revolution	Revisited, that much of what government 
does is dismissed as spin, that ministers are disbelieved and government as a whole is 
mistrusted; that policies should not be announced as if driven by headlines, re-announcing 
should not happen, government should be scrupulous with the facts and ministers should 
be more open and directly engage with all the media rather than a selection, http://www.
levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Lord-Mandelson-Annex-1.pdf

•  98/1-102/2, about the relationship between the government and the media, describing 
the  relationships  of  specific  governments  with  the  media,  that  the  demands  and 
scepticism  of  the  press  have  become  greater,  and  that  the  tension  in  the  relationship 
became unbearable; that the losers in the breakdown of the relationship are the public, 
who do not know who or what to believe and who are misguided by the way news or 
political 
is  presented,  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/

information 

•  Lord Mandelson 87/22-89/21, referring to his book The	Blair	Revolution	Revisited, that 
the overuse and misuse of media skills by the New Labour government had harmed the 
character of the government, and that spin in the eyes of the media became anything that 
a minister or someone working for a minister said, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-21-May-20121.pdf

Ed Miliband MP:
•  p4, that trust in media and politicians has been harmed by revelations of relationships

org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Witness-Statement-of-Ed-Miliband.pdf

Peter Oborne:
•  para 6, that the invisible connection between politicians and the media has done harm to 
the public interest, and that a great deal of ‘news’ has been a manifestation of manipulative 
populism – i.e. a manifestation of power, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/
uploads/2012/05/Witness-Statement-of-Peter-Oborne.pdf

•  6/16-7/19,  that  government  communications  under  New  Labour  constituted  a  new 
epistemology  where  truth  was  defined  as  that  which  served  the  purposes  of  the 
government or the party in power, and that denials or assertions were an instrument of 
government rather than of the truth; and at 39/15-40/25, that having a political figure 
deliver briefings to the lobby is a hazard, and that a civil servant should brief on behalf 
of  the  government,  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/

APPENDICESLord O’Donnell:
•  at para 32, that the Order in Council used by the Blair government created the impression 
of politicisation in Downing Street communications and that it is perception that is the 
critical  test  in  propriety  and  ethics,  http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/
uploads/2012/05/Witness-Statement-of-Lord-ODonnell.pdf

•  77/18-82/8, that it is important that the Prime Minister’s official spokesman is a civil servant 
with absolute credibility, and that there is a weakness in the special adviser system with 
regards to managerial responsibility, and that ministers should be clear about what their 
special advisers should be doing in relation to the media, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.

Hearing-16-May-2012.pdf

Neil Wallis:
•  pp3-4,  that  government  and  political  party  PR  machines  do  not  give  the  public  the
