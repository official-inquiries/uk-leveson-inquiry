Chapter 1 | IntroductionChapTer 1 
inTroduCTion

1.  overview
1.1  Whether published every day, every week or every month, the press produce a vast amount 
of reading material covering an enormous range of topics. The daily and weekly papers will 
cover – in no particular order – news, politics, investigations, foreign affairs, business, sport, 
culture (including books, art, film and theatre), property, fashion, travel, motoring, personal 
finance, entertainment, TV and radio, games and doubtless other topics. There are features 
and opinions, gossip and jokes. They inform and they entertain and they do so very much in 
the public interest. The overwhelming majority of these topics are attractively covered in a 
way that undoubtedly appeals to readers. 

1.2 

The reason that the Inquiry has not focussed on what is the overwhelming majority of the 
work of journalists is that, in the main, there is no public concern about the way in which 
most of these topics have been reported. The culture, practices and ethics of the press that 
are of interest to the Inquiry cover only one aspect of the way in which the press goes about 
its business. True, there could be arguments about the extent to which a travel journalist or 
food critic should inform the reader that he or she received a discounted or complimentary 
holiday or meal, but such issues are on the very edge of what the Inquiry has been concerned 
about. The focus, therefore, has only been on those areas which have been the subject of 
criticism; in particular, the way in which parts of the press can deal with individuals without 
regard to their rights and without regard to the public interest. It must be remembered that 
these  are  individuals  who  almost  invariably  do  not  have  the  same  megaphone  to  defend 
themselves or put the contrary view.

1.3  Most of the topics covered by the press will never trouble any regulator, whether it is the 
Press Complaints Commission (PCC) or someone else. As a result, the need for a regulator 
and the scope of its authority is not dictated by issues that arise from the vast majority of 
stories. But that is not the same as saying that there is no need for a regulator. Most doctors 
behave impeccably towards their patients but a regulatory mechanism is necessary for those 
who do not, whether on a serial basis or because of a single lapse. The need to examine the 
criticisms of the press inevitably focuses on those areas that cause difficulty so as to ensure 
that, whatever the answer to regulation is, it can deal with these issues.

1.4 

I am conscious that focussing on criticisms of the press will cause (and has, indeed, caused) 
many to criticise the Inquiry on the basis that it has been slanted to the poor practices and 
has paid insufficient attention to good practices. Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily 
Mirror, for instance, complained at the conclusion of his evidence that a lot of the very good 
things  that newspapers  have done  and  continue  to  do  were not  being  highlighted by the 
Inquiry. He said it was “like a rock star having an album brought out from his back catalogue 
of all his worst-ever hits”.1 To some extent, that is the inevitable consequence of the Inquiry’s 
Terms  of  Reference  and  its  focus  on  public  concerns  and  complaints  rather  than  on  the 
successes and achievements of the press. During the course of the Inquiry, I made it clear 
that I did not believe that the culture, practices and ethics of the press were predominantly

sub-standard or worthy of criticism. In my view the majority of editors, journalists and others 
who work for both the national and regional press do good work in the public interest, as well 
as entertaining their readers. I have no doubt that the press can take pride in most of its work.

However, good practices do not require a public inquiry and do not require regulation. They 
also  take  less  time  to  define,  describe  and  substantiate,  and  can  be  cast  in  a  way  that  is 
entirely uncontroversial. It takes far more time and space to consider and analyse the extent 
to which complaints and criticisms are well-founded, and to identify the mechanisms that 
should be available to encourage all that is good while discouraging that which is properly 
capable of criticism. As a consequence, this important Part of the Report starts, at Chapter 
2, with a recognition of the enormous value that the press plays in our daily life, and notes 
that for all of the examples of poor practice cited below, there are many more examples of 
good practice. However, having said that, the rest of this Part of the Report focuses on the 
concerns and complaints that have been made and expressed, along with the ways in which 
they have or have not been adequately addressed. It would be entirely wrong to view the 
number of words expended in this Report on the good versus the bad as reflecting any overall 
judgment. The nature of my task is to focus on those aspects of press culture, practices and 
ethics (even if in small pockets) which leave something to be desired. Inevitably, the focus is 
overwhelmingly on poor practice rather than good.

2.  Module one and the Terms of reference
2.1 

This Part of the Report examines the evidence the Inquiry has received relating to ‘the Press 
and  the  Public’,  in  other  words,  the  first  of  the  four  modules  into  which  the  work  of  the 
Inquiry was conveniently allocated.

2.2 

The Terms of Reference do not specifically mention ‘the public’ (cf. politicians and the police) 
but  it  is  obvious  that  any  inquiry  into  the  culture,  practices  and  ethics  of  the  press  must 
investigate all the respects in which press conduct and behaviour (nouns which do appear in 
the express wording) impact on those who feature predominantly in the work of newspapers, 
in  other  words  ‘the  public’.  Indeed,  owing  to  the  nature  of  the  concerns  which  directly 
triggered the setting up of the Inquiry, I decided to bring ‘the public’ into the heart of the first 
module. The relationships between the press and the police, and the press and politicians, 
naturally give rise to slightly different issues which could best be addressed after Module 
One.

2.3 

The terminology – the ‘culture, practices and ethics’ of the press – was the subject of analysis 
by Counsel to the Inquiry in opening Module One in November 2011, and submissions by the 
Core Participants. The analysis of Robert Jay QC was as follows:2

“It may be helpful to take those three terms together. We are looking at practices 
which may be widespread rather than isolated and sporadic. Practices which may 
be widespread, insofar as they are bad practices, may well flow from systems which 
are  broken  and/or  from  attitudes  and  mores  which  are  dysfunctional.  The  more 
we may see patterns of behaviour and practices which are generic, and the more 
widespread they are, the more it may be possible to infer the existence of broken 
systems, dysfunctional attitudes and mores; and, overall, the existence of a culture 
which tends to explain why these problems are occurring in the first place.”

2 p19, lines 3-14, Robert Jay, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Transcript-of-Morning-
Hearing-14-November-2011.pdf

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF2.4 

Further, in my ruling on the Application of Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, I said this:3

“Turning from the general to the specific, it is first necessary to consider the Terms 
of  Reference  which  clearly  visualise  ‘the  press’  as  capable  of  being  a  sufficiently 
homogeneous  group  to  allow  analysis  of  its  culture,  practices  and  ethics  even  if 
(as  is  undoubtedly  the  case)  different  titles  and  different  types  of  newspaper  will 
or may exhibit different or slightly different approaches to them. Nobody, however, 
has  suggested  that  the  legal  or  ethical  approach  should  be  different  even  if  the 
pressures, the likely impact of ethical considerations on the type of story sought and 
the willingness to take risks might be. Having said that, it is clear that an isolated 
act of criminal or unethical behaviour would not, of itself, represent the culture or 
constitute a practice of ‘the press’. Subject to a practice being sufficiently widespread 
to  constitute  evidence  of  a  culture  or  practice  of  the  press,  however,  there  is  no 
question of it being necessary to quantify that practice and, in any event, I will need 
to consider the extent to which the picture is built up inferentially and cumulatively.”

2.5 

2.6 

2.7 

These broad interpretations, which in my view make the same points in different ways, have 
been  my  guiding  principles  throughout  this  Inquiry.  Thus,  the  endeavour  throughout  has 
been to focus on the generic or, more precisely, what might on first examination be evidence 
bearing on the culture, practices and ethics of the press overall. On occasion, I have come 
to the conclusion that evidence which had the appearance of exemplifying this core issue 
within my Terms of Reference did not, in fact, demonstrate any generic failing, but rather was 
indicative of the isolated or wayward. On other occasions, I have rejected the submissions of 
Core Participants that I should conclude that some failing was a ‘one-off’ and have decided 
that it was, in fact, illustrative of a wider problem. Throughout, I have had regard to a possible 
broader picture without pre-judging the issue: whether or not a piece of evidence is truly 
part of the jigsaw has depended on assessing that evidence in its own terms and then more 
widely; but the point to be reiterated and fully understood is that the shape and nature of 
the jigsaw did not come into sharp and clear relief until the end of the Inquiry, after all the 
evidence had been assessed and analysed.

There are three further points I would like to make at this stage. First, although I recognise 
the inherent difficulties, there are clear practical reasons why the press should be considered 
as a broad entity rather than as a series of individual print titles. This, as I have already stated 
in my ruling of 1 May 20124, is not the same as saying that ‘the culture’ at each newspaper 
is exactly the same. Journalists move from newspaper to newspaper, and the commercial 
pressures I explore below are similar across the industry as a whole; I recognise that some 
newspapers are more profitable than others and that newspapers vary in respect of the sort 
of stories they like to print. Furthermore, the industry is fairly closely-knit in the sense that 
newspapers competing with one another tend to have a fair idea of what their colleagues or 
competitors are up to.

Second, although the Terms of Reference are not worded so as to pre-judge the issue, it is 
clear  that  those  who  participated  in  their  formulation  were  of  the  view  that  the  culture, 
practices and ethics of the press left something to be desired. Thus, paragraph 1d of the Terms 
of Reference refers to ‘media misconduct’ (in the context of previous warnings), paragraph 
2a to a ‘new more effective policy and regulatory regime’ (implying that the existing regime 
is  ineffective  to  address  the  problem),  and  paragraph  2b  to  ‘future  concerns  about  press

2.9 

behaviour’  (implying  that  press  misbehaviour  is  a  current  concern).  Plainly,  the  Terms  of 
Reference require me to describe and characterise press conduct and, where appropriate, 
to identify causes: in other words, fully to diagnose the problem before potential solutions 
and remedies are recommended. Given what had been revealed at the News of the World 
(NoTW), that may not be surprising but it is important to underline that I have approached 
this exercise with an open mind, and not on the basis that the explicit and implicit premises 
of the Terms of Reference do not require independent validation by me.

Third, and a point which again flows directly from an examination of the Terms of Reference, my 
recommendations must support ‘the integrity and freedom of the press...while encouraging 
the highest ethical and professional standards’ (paragraph 2a). It is clear from this language 
that the Inquiry must do its best to foster a free press which has integrity as well as ethical 
standards:  indeed,  the  highest  ethical  and  professional  standards.  Many  commentators 
have focused on the importance of a free press (which I would be the first to recognise and 
uphold) without any reference to the need for an ethical press to possess integrity. These 
are demanding standards and require ethical judgments to be made at all material times: 
merely  to  broadcast  the  values  of  ‘freedom’  is  seriously  to  overlook  a  complementary 
and equally important set of values, and to run the danger of creating or permitting that 
which is undesirable and not in the public interest. In my view, the unification of these twin 
requirements – freedom and ethics – is not an impossible aspiration: both may co-exist in 
the same press, working in harmony and in cooperation with each other. But the recognition 
of the need for an ethical press inevitably carries with it the recognition of the need for a 
responsible press, which respects the rights and interests and others, and which does not 
regard ‘freedom’ as the ultimate panacea or touchstone for its mores and conduct.

As a final point, I should note that many of the arguments made in respect of the rights or 
wrongs of the practices and ethics of the press can turn on one’s view of the amorphous 
concept  of  the  public  interest.  Many  otherwise  unethical  practices  may  be  made  ethical 
simply by virtue of the fact that they are justified, in the circumstances, in the public interest. 
For  example,  covert  surveillance  and  photography  of  an  actress  playing  with  her  children 
in  a  private  garden  is  almost  certain  to  be  unethical;  by  contrast,  the  covert  surveillance 
and  photography  of  drug  dealers  supplying  heroin  (in  the  equivalent  of  a  back  garden)  is 
almost undeniably ethical and entirely in the public interest. As such, the Terms of Reference 
do require me, when assessing the culture, practices and ethics of the press, to engage in 
questions relating to the public interest.

2.10  There can be many reasonable views of what is, or is not, in the public interest. In line with 
judicial authority, it is not for me to impose my own conception as the correct and only one: 
the judgment of editors and journalists should be given significant weight.5 But that does 
not mean that journalists and editors have free rein to define the public interest however 
they choose. It is clear, as most (but not all) have fully recognised, that the public interest is 
something quite different from simply what interests the public.

3.  evidence in Module one of the inquiry
3.1  Module One sat for 40 days between 14 November 2011 (when Mr Jay opened the Module)6 
and 9 February 2012, closing with supplementary evidence from Paul Dacre. However, as I

have explained, the modules do not form hermetically sealed caskets and further evidence 
relevant to Module One was adduced at later stages.

The body of evidence received by the Inquiry is vast, both in terms of its volume and scope, and 
it will not be possible to deal with all of it in this Report. To do so would create a sprawling and 
overly cumbersome narrative which would imbalance the Report as a whole, lack appropriate 
focus and, in consequence, fail to do justice to the Terms of Reference. Instead, I adopt a more 
focused, thematic and analytical approach which serves to find the right balance between 
indiscriminate citation of the evidence on the one hand and overly boiling down the material 
on the other. My overriding goal is, and always has been, to set out a sufficient narrative 
which enables everyone to understand the basis of my generic conclusions in relation to the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press; and, even more saliently, my recommendations 
as to a new regulatory regime. Even adopting this more tailored approach, I recognise that 
there will inevitably be elements of duplication and overlap. This is largely for two reasons: 
first, certain pieces of evidence may be relevant to more than one generic conclusion, and 
second because there is more than one way of approaching, narrating and analysing the key 
elements of the story. My different angles of approach will sometimes require me to recruit 
the same evidence for slightly different purposes.

3.3  Module  One  saw  evidence  given  by  a  range  of  people,  chosen  to  provide  as  complete  a 
picture as possible on the relationship between the press and the public. Those witnesses 
broadly fell into categories as described below.

3.4 

3.5 

First, the Inquiry heard from 21 witnesses from across British society, each with a different 
personal  story  to  tell  about  their  adverse  treatment  by  parts  of  the  press.  As  more  fully 
explained below, some of the witnesses may fairly be described as ‘celebrities’; others were 
individuals who would challenge that characterisation and say that they do not seek out fame 
or media celebrity as such but find their way into the public eye only because they are good at 
what they do (whether it be acting, singing, writing, playing sports); others have featured in 
the press because they are unfortunate enough to be the victims of crime, or otherwise have 
been associated with notorious crime; and yet others have been ordinary people who have 
attracted press interest for whatever reason. Thus, the witnesses occupied a disparate range 
of occupations and social groups, and no one could fairly say that they were all celebrities, 
still less that they openly courted publicity and should therefore accept the rough with the 
smooth.

Although most witnesses were required both to make statements and to give evidence by 
reason of a notice issued under s21 of the Inquiries Act 2005, these witnesses (all of whom 
were  speaking  about  intensely  personal  experiences)  were  not.  They  were  self-selected 
from among the Core Participants who complained about press intrusion. As I have made 
clear, in the main, their evidence was not subjected to detailed probing by Counsel to the 
Inquiry and, in accordance with my direction, there was no cross-examination by the other 
Core Participants, although they did suggest questions (which Counsel generally then felt it 
appropriate to ask) and were, additionally, allowed (if not encouraged) to put in evidence in 
rebuttal if so advised. Accordingly, the Inquiry recognises that some of this evidence was not 
fully tested for its reliability and credibility in a manner which would have been appropriate 
had it been essential to reach findings of fact at a granular level. Nonetheless, nobody has 
suggested that the majority of the evidence received by those witnesses was anything other 
than reliable and so, as a whole, it casts important light on the broad issue of the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press.

443

Chapter 1 | IntroductionF3.6 

3.7 

3.8 

Second,  the  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from  journalists  and  commentators  who  had  written 
about  their  experience  of  the  culture,  practices  and  ethics  of  the  press.  Those  critical  of 
press standards included Richard Peppiatt, a former journalist, and Alastair Campbell, the 
former Director of Communications for No 10. At the other extreme end of the spectrum was 
Paul McMullan who rejoiced in an anarchical view of the approach to any standards within 
the press. In the middle, there were others whose evidence, on the face of their witness 
statements,  was  more  favourable  to  the  press,  but  who  also  needed  to  be  probed  and 
tested not least as they moved away from prior published statements on the subject matter. 
Witnesses in this category included Mr Morgan and Sharon Marshall, a former journalist with 
the NoTW.

Third,  the  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from  each  of  the  national  titles  in  England  and  Wales, 
some magazines and similar publications, and also from a sample of regional titles and those 
publishing in the devolved administrations. In the time available it was not possible to do 
other than hear from a representative sample of journalists in order to give me a flavour of 
the position, although it should be recorded that the Inquiry did hear in person from virtually 
all the national newspaper editors and proprietors (albeit that the timing of the evidence 
of many of the proprietors was at the start of Module Three not least because they had a 
number of topics to cover and I wished to ensure that they did not have to appear at the 
Inquiry more than once). Aside from being asked to elaborate on the key points made in their 
detailed witness statements, editors and journalists were asked to address and comment on 
examples of the culture, practices and ethics of the press which had come to the Inquiry’s 
notice, some exemplifying ostensibly good practice, others less good.

Inevitably, the Inquiry’s most detailed consideration was reserved for what may be called 
the ‘really big stories’, some of which are addressed as exemplifying facets of the culture, 
practices  and  ethics  of  the  press  below.7  Equally  inevitably,  the  Inquiry  in  these  instances 
heard evidence from the journalists and editors involved: as was made clear at the time, and I 
reiterate, the purpose of doing this was not to subject the journalists in particular to personal 
censure, but rather to examine what they did (and did not do) for the light it was capable of 
throwing on the general picture. That said, I fully understand that the experience of giving 
evidence before a televised public inquiry could not always have been a pleasant one for the 
press witnesses concerned: the Inquiry is grateful for their contributions, and notes that, on 
all occasions, witnesses were treated with courtesy and consideration.

3.9 

Fourth, the Inquiry also received evidence in Module One from those involved in electronic 
media and the internet, with a view to seeking to understand the specific challenges presented 
to  press  regulation  generally  by  the  existence  of  the  worldwide  web  and  the  burgeoning 
range of possibilities created by new technology.

3.10  Fifth, the Inquiry heard evidence from a number of special interest groups bringing different 
perspectives to my deliberations.  First, there was a range of  groups, such  as Trans  Media 
Watch,  ENGAGE  and  End  Violence  against  Women,  who  complained  about  unbalanced 
reporting in the press of issues concerning them, and of the failure of the PCC to address 
their  concerns.  Second,  there  were  other  groups,  such  as  English  PEN  and  Index  against 
Censorship, who came to the Inquiry with particular perspectives on Article 10, free speech 
and public interest issues. Third, there were organisations such as Full Fact and the Science 
Media Centre, concerned about inaccuracy in press reporting, either generally or in a specific 
context. This list is not exhaustive, either of the groups who testified or of the issues they 
covered, but it provides a flavour of the range of evidence the Inquiry has been asked to 

7 Part F, Chapter 5

444

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFtake into account: a considerable body of other evidence to like effect but affecting other 
interested or concerned groups was read into the record of the Inquiry.

3.11  Sixth,  the  Inquiry  heard  from  those  with  experience  in  the  Press  Complaints  Commission 
(PCC) and the Press Board of Finance (PressBof), covering the existing system of regulation of 
the press and proposals for the future. The Inquiry heard from the past and current directors 
and chairs of the PCC, and the current chair of PressBof, Lord Black. The present chair of 
the PCC, Lord Hunt, assisted the Inquiry with the then current state of play regarding the 
industry’s proposals for ‘self-regulation’ within a new contractual framework, and he returned 
to update me on this topic in Module Four.

3.12  Finally,  a  different  perspective  on  the  approach  to  stories  came  from  the  Information 
Commissioner  and  the  police.  As  for  the  Information  Commissioner,  the  evidence  from 
Operation Motorman provides a window on the way in which some journalistic investigations 
were conducted or information researched (albeit without the knowledge of those affected). 
Its significance is such that it is summarised in Part E, Chapter 3; the position is then subject 
to separate analysis in Part H. As for the police, their investigations are detailed in Part E, 
Chapters 2, 4 and 5.

3.13  This short summary scarcely gives the full flavour of the scope, range and scale of the evidence 
the Inquiry received during the first 40 days of its sitting. The live oral evidence, accompanying 
witness statements and exhibits, and the read-in evidence, including all the documentary 
evidence and submissions, add up to a very substantial mass of material, all of which has 
been  sifted,  read,  considered  and  analysed  with  a  view  to  drawing  the  Inquiry’s  generic 
conclusions. Recognising that this burden of material only represents a small proportion of 
the evidence which might have been adduced had time and resources been greater, I should 
nonetheless record that I believe that the evidence that has been received is sufficient in 
terms of its quality and quantity to enable me to discharge my Terms of Reference.

Evidence from “the Public”

3.14  As  set  out  above,  the  Inquiry  heard  evidence  of  unethical  and  damaging  press  behaviour 
from  a  broad  and  representative  cross-section  of  society.  Witnesses  to  the  Inquiry  have 
included: individuals with a public profile; the victims of crime and indeed those incorrectly 
accused of criminality or other wrong-doing by the press; innocent bystanders to events; and 
individuals who may themselves be of no obvious in interest to the wider public but for their 
connections to the types of person set out above. These individuals have contributed to the 
Inquiry’s work either by formally testifying in person or through witness statements which 
were read in to the Inquiry record, or through the mechanism of informal submissions to 
the Inquiry from ordinary members of the public made in response to questions published 
on the Inquiry website. I recognise the obvious limitations inherent in this latter category of 
evidence  and,  whilst  appreciating  the  contributions  which  have  been  made,  do  not  place 
independent reliance on this informal material.

3.15 

It  is  wrong  to  suggest  that  the  public  are  somehow  homogeneous,  or  that  (as  some 
commentators have suggested) the Inquiry has only heard the complaints of the rich and 
famous. This is not the case: the spectrum of people who claim to have been the victims of 
unethical or damaging behaviour by the press and have given their personal accounts to the 
Inquiry is broad.

Chapter 1 | IntroductionFPeople with a public profile

3.16  People with a public profile can be visualised in different ways, depending mainly on how that 
profile arises. Evidently, there are those who occupy positions of power and responsibility 
in our democracy and who, by virtue of these functions, legitimately attract the interest of 
the press. Everyone can readily understand and appreciate who falls into this first category 
but, for my part, it is interesting to ask whether press proprietors and editors should be seen 
as being part of that group and, if so, how much press attention they personally attract. It 
should also be emphasised that what I have described as the legitimate interest of the press 
should not be understood as a carte blanche to look everywhere: the public’s right to know is 
circumscribed by the subject-matter, and a correct appreciation of what the public truly has 
a right to know about.

3.17 

‘People with a public profile’ also includes those who have become famous as a consequence 
of their success in their chosen career or profession. This second sub-group includes (in terms 
of those who have testified before me): footballers, such as Garry Flitcroft; musicians, such as 
the singer Charlotte Church; as well as film and television stars such as the television presenter, 
Anne  Diamond,  and  the  actors  Sienna  Miller  and  Hugh  Grant.  These  are  all  individuals  in 
whom the public is interested as a consequence of the success they enjoy in their chosen 
walks of life, but they are also individuals whose private lives are largely unrelated to their 
professional lives and their careers.

3.18  As has been frequently pointed out to the Inquiry by the press Core Participants, some within 
this sub-group, but none of those mentioned above, have sought commercial advantage from 
displaying  a  particular  brand  or  persona  before  the  public,  or  have  made  representations 
about themselves for direct or indirect advantage. But one does need to be clear about this, 
because just as ‘the freedom of the press’ has been pronounced by some as a mantra which 
conquers all, so has ‘hypocrisy’ been used indiscriminately in support of unjustified intrusions 
into the private lives of the famous and the successful. By way of illustrating, but not at this 
stage analysing the point, Mr Grant told the Inquiry:8

“... I wasn’t aware I traded on my good name. I’ve never had a good name. And it’s 
made absolutely no difference at all. I’m the man who was arrested with a prostitute 
and the film still made tons of money.”

3.19  Further, the writer JK Rowling also told the Inquiry that she most emphatically does not seek 

fame or to benefit from her public persona, yet is still the subject of intense press interest.9

3.20  This category of people with a public profile also includes a third sub-group: individuals who 
are famous only for their celebrity, or put another way the mere fact of their having entered 
the public eye. These people are those who actively participate in the ‘celebrity industry,’ 
actively pursuing publicity’s sake, employing publicists to provide a steady stream of stories to 
the press and to inform paparazzi of their whereabouts, in order to ensure that they continue 
to appear in the public eye. This sub-group might reasonably be said to include, for example, 
some stars of reality television. Certainly in these cases, where the fame of the individual is 
linked to their exposure to the public through the press and other media, the relationship 
between  individual  and  the  press,  and  what  is  acceptable  and  what  is  unethical,  is  more 
nuanced. In such cases the public interest in what might otherwise be private matters may

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFwell be stronger and the nature of what can and cannot be considered private may be more 
difficult to determine.

Victims of crime

3.21  Members of the public who have been at the receiving end of unethical behaviour by the 
press also include the victims of crime and individuals who have been linked, either directly 
or indirectly, to crimes. To an extent this level of scrutiny is understandable as crime remains 
a key concern for the public and indeed much crime reporting is of the highest standard. 
However, the Inquiry has heard evidence in relation to some crime reporting, by a number 
of newspapers, that is alleged to have fallen far short of acceptable standards of behaviour 
in terms of inaccuracy and intrusiveness, sometimes giving rise to concerns of the risk of 
prejudicing subsequent criminal proceedings and, in relation to those who are already the 
victims of crime, causing considerable additional harm and distress.

3.22  This  category  of  individual  includes  those  who  have  been  harmed  emotionally  as  well  as 
suffering damage to their reputations, such as Drs Kate and Gerry McCann whose daughter 
Madeleine  disappeared  when  the  family  was  holidaying  in  Portugal  in  May  2007.  The 
subsequent coverage of Madeleine’s disappearance included libellous and highly inaccurate 
articles in a number of newspapers, particularly in The Daily Express which made a number 
of  allegations  about  the  entirely  unproven  role  of  Drs  Kate  and  Gerry  McCann  in  the 
disappearance of their daughter.10

3.23  This sub-category also includes the parents of the murdered school girl Milly Dowler. Bob 
and Sally Dowler were subjected to an unwarranted barrage of intense and intrusive media 
attention.11 Aside from the well-publicised matters which led to the setting up of this Inquiry, 
moments  of  intense  private  grief  were  captured  by  photographers  and  published  in  the 
NoTW.12

3.24  These  high-profile  cases  are  far  from  isolated  examples.  The  Inquiry  also  heard  evidence 
from the parents of Diane Watson, who was murdered at school in Glasgow in 1991. In their 
evidence to the Inquiry, Mr and Mrs Watson not only raised the issue of unwarranted and 
indeed intrusive press attention but also, like the McCanns, pointed to the highly inaccurate 
and sensationalised reporting around their daughter’s death.13

3.25  Such intense press interest is not restricted to the victims of crime but also extends to those 
who have been linked to, or wrongly, accused or suspected of committing, crimes. Christopher 
Jefferies was arrested in relation to the murder of the student Joanna Yeates at the very end 
of 2010 but subsequently was released without charge; he was not merely cleared of any 
wrong-doing but proved to have been a victim himself, the subject of disinformation by the 
killer  intent  on  avoiding  his  own  responsibility.  However,  as  more  fully  examined  below,14 
during the course of the investigation, Mr Jefferies was subjected to a protracted campaign 
of vilification in the press. This saw a significant number of libellous allegations made by a

to be in contempt of court. Indeed, so intense and unpalatable was this press attention that 
Mr Jefferies was forced to leave his home and change his appearance.15

3.26 

3.27 

Innocent bystanders
It is not only individuals with public profiles and the victims of crime who have been the 
subject of intense press scrutiny and potentially unethical and damaging reporting. There are 
also many other ordinary members of the public who have complained of unwarranted press 
attention in a number of different respects. In particular, the Inquiry heard evidence from a 
number of organisations representing minority, community and societal groups alleging that 
individuals  within  those  groups,  or  the  groups  themselves,  have  attracted  inaccurate  and 
discriminatory press interest. By way of example only, I have already mentioned Trans Media 
Watch, a charitable and support organisation which represents the interests of members of the 
transgender community by in particular monitoring the quality of reporting of newspapers on 
transgender issues. Their basic complaint, which will be examined in greater detail below,16 is 
that transgender people are subject to disproportionate and damaging press attention simply 
by dint of being members of that group, rather than in consequence of anything they might 
have said or done, and because of what they describe as an obsession in parts of the British 
press with ‘outing’ members of the transgender community.17

Individuals who fall into this category do not consist only of members of pre-formed groups. 
The category also extends to individuals who may find themselves at the centre of damaging 
media attention, such as the families of suicides and also suicide victims themselves. The 
Inquiry has heard evidence of intrusive and damaging press attention directed at the grieving 
families of suicides. In evidence to the Inquiry, the Samaritans describe the damaging and 
intrusive nature of press reporting of the suicides of a number of young people in Bridgend 
over a six month period in 2007 and 2008.18 During this time, it is argued, the relatives of some 
of these young people were not only subject to, sensationalised reporting which propounded 
unfounded speculation that they were linked through a cult or death pact, but also turned 
their relatives into the subject of newspaper stories.19

Those with links to the above

3.28  The last category of person to be considered here is broader and perhaps more nebulous; 
it  covers  those  who  have  become  the  subject  of  press  speculation  and  attention  as  a 
consequence of the links they may have to those groups or types of people described above. 
Included in this category are people like the parents of the singer Charlotte Church, who have 
been subject at times to intense press attention and a substantial number of intrusive and 
hurtful newspaper articles.20 Media interest in the parents of Ms Church clearly has more 
to do with their relationship to their famous daughter than their own actions: such interest 
would  not  have  arisen  otherwise.  Another  is  the  mother  of  Hugh  Grant’s  daughter  and,

are not even targeted or explicitly written about but become ‘collateral damage’ because of 
the suspicions generated by subterfuge.

4.  The structure of part F of the report
4.1 

Turning to the overall contours and direction of this Part of the Report, Chapter 2 summarises 
my own assessment of the evidence of good press practices, and reflects my view that the 
press  can  take  pride  in  most  of  its  work.  However,  even  if  the  examples  of  good  practice 
represent the vast bulk of the way in which the press works, it cannot be said that there is no 
cause for concern.

4.2 

4.3 

4.4 

4.5 

Chapter  3  moves  to  summarise  the  aspects  of  press  practices  which  have  given  rise  to 
complaint and concern. Standing back from all the evidence that the Inquiry has received over 
the past year, it is possible to discern a number of common themes or complaint headings 
which are set out in summary form in this Chapter before the further analysis which follows. 
Chapter 3 also summarises the nature of the harm suffered by individuals and by the public 
at large as a result of unacceptable press practices. It is necessary to assess the impact of 
unethical press practices in this way because the benefits of a free press cannot be assessed 
in isolation from other considerations: if a free press amounts to a press which, to a greater or 
lesser extent, fails to adhere to proper standards of behaviour, the consequences need fully 
to be understood.

Nobody denies that the poor practices identified in Chapter 3 exist in some form or other, 
although there may well be arguments or debates about the extent to which they prevail (if at 
all) in individual titles. It must be remembered, however, that this is a qualitative assessment 
based  on  more  than  the  odd  or  exceptional  example  (what  is  happening?)  rather  than  a 
quantitative assessment (to what extent and in what particular titles?). When considering 
the success or otherwise of a regulatory regime, that must be the starting point. It is also 
why the submission made by some individual titles (that the conduct of which complaint is 
made cannot be brought home to them) simply misses the point: I am required to consider 
the press as a whole and the fact that any particular title (if it be the case) may never engage 
in the practices of which complaint is made is irrelevant.

Chapter 4 is devoted to the culture at the NoTW, in respects beyond the practice of phone-
hacking which is addressed elsewhere. I dedicated a week of Inquiry time to this topic in 
December  2011,  and,  on  other  occasions,  witnesses  such  as  Paul  McMullan  and  Sharon 
Marshall testified in somewhat different ways to the culture at that now defunct title. Given 
that the goings-on at the NoTW were the immediate trigger to the setting up of this Inquiry, 
it is appropriate to devote a whole chapter to this issue.

Chapter  5  takes  a  series  of  what  I  am  calling  ‘case  studies’  –  in  truth,  some  of  the  most 
egregious stories the Inquiry examined in Module One – as exemplifications of the unethical 
press practices which underpin the core generic conclusions reached in the following chapter, 
Chapter 6. Accordingly, the case studies should be read not as random or individual instances 
of sub-standard press practice but as the exemplars of a wider problem. The fact that a title 
or a journalist is either necessarily identified or is capable of identification in a case study 
should not be taken as meaning that I am seeking to place that title or that journalist in a 
different category to those responsible for other examples of poor practice given in evidence 
to the Inquiry.

449

Chapter 1 | IntroductionF4.6 

4.7 

In Chapter 6 I seek to evaluate and analyse, in detail, the evidence of press practices which 
have given rise to concern, and to come to what may be called generic conclusions about 
the culture, practices and ethics of the press from this critical stand-point. Inevitably, this is a 
lengthy chapter. Not merely is the evidence voluminous but the issues which arise from it are 
complex and multi-faceted. I should emphasise that in reaching the conclusions I do, I have 
paid very careful regard to all the evidence the Inquiry has accumulated as well as the Core 
Participants’ helpful submissions.

Finally, in Chapter 7, I draw overall conclusions and seek to identify some of the drivers for 
unethical practices within parts of the press. Those drivers include the impact of commercial 
pressures in a shrinking newspaper market; the specific employment context in a number of 
newspaper titles; and inadequacies in internal governance and leadership at individual titles. 
Ultimately, the Chapter concludes with a recognition that the unethical practices identified 
throughout the Report require both cultural, as well as systemic, changes within newspaper 
titles. While these changes must come from within newspaper groups, they must also be 
monitored and enforced by a robust and empowered regulator.

Overview
This Chapter of the Report will examine what is far too easy to take for granted, namely that 
in so many important respects the press is a force for good in British society. This issue is 
capable of being analysed in a number of ways. The first two concern over-arching issues 
relating to society as a whole. Thus, the very existence of a free press is invaluable in the 
sense that societies without such a press are invariably totalitarian regimes which do not 
and cannot, countenance the type of scrutiny which only an untrammelled Fourth Estate is 
capable of applying. Second, as many Core Participants have pointed out, a free press is the 
lifeblood of a mature democracy: it is an invaluable medium for the representatives of the 
people to get their message across, and an equally invaluable means both of examining the 
political message and holding the messengers to account.1

The second type of analysis is more pragmatic but no less important; however many times 
it was repeated during the course of the Inquiry, it continues to require emphasis. Most of 
the work of the press represents good practice rather than bad. Broadly speaking, stories 
are accurate, informative, well-written and respectful of the rights and interests of others. 
Further and additional to that point, it is equally important to underline that the press carries 
out a valuable role in entertaining its readers according to their tastes and interests: indeed, 
if it failed in this important respect, readers would desert to other newspapers or other forms 
of media, including the array of electronic media currently available and ever burgeoning, as 
their preferred means of obtaining information.

These features lead to a further point which it is relevant to make in this context (as well as in 
other places). However cheap and easy access to online aggregated material, blogs and tweets 
might be, it is to those whose business is the collection, collation, accurate presentation and 
analysis of news, related commentary, current affairs, sports, fashion and entertainment (to 
name but a few) that the public look for informed views. Those who are in that business are 
called journalists and whether they produce their content in print or online, it is vital that 
their work continues to be trusted and recognised for the good that, in the main, it does and 
for the very important contribution that it makes to our society.

Existence of a free press: its intrinsic value
The submissions of News International have reminded the Inquiry of an exchange in Sir Tom 
Stoppard’s satire on the British news media, Night and Day, published in 1978. Milne says to 
Ruth: ‘No matter how imperfect things are, if you’ve got a free press everything is correctable, 
and without it everything is concealable’. Ruth replies: ‘I’m with you on the free press. It’s the 
newspapers I cannot stand’.

1 These concepts are discussed in greater detail in Part B Chapter 1 concerned with the importance of a free press and 
freedom of speech

451

F1.5 

1.6 

1.7 

The point is rightly made that freedom of the press is essential to a free society, and one of 
the key hallmarks of societies which are not free is the absence of a free press.2 Arguably, 
the point can be taken even further: there is a close correlation between press freedom on 
the one hand and the extent to which a society may be seen as being open and free on the 
other. And this is not simply a matter of journalists, editors and proprietors not being held 
in the thrall of the Executive: press freedom requires the press to discharge their important 
responsibilities by being ever-questioning and ever-vigilant, if necessary noisy, iconoclastic, 
irreverent and unruly. It remains to be considered whether, as has been suggested, it is these 
same instincts which may from time to time cause the press to be led astray.

Accordingly,  the  existence  of  a  free  press  is  valuable  in  itself  and  not  merely  for  all  the 
benefits it carries with it. It is noteworthy that not one witness suggested anything to the 
contrary, and that virtually all the witnesses who had come to tell their personal stories of 
press misconduct were at pains to explain that they believed in the value of a free press in 
its own right. Being free, however, is not the same as insisting on a free for all without any 
accountability of any sort.

Preponderance of good practice over the bad
Although the point has already been made that the Inquiry is not in a position to quantify 
reliably the amount of bad practice perpetrated by the press over the years, and furthermore 
does not need to do so in order properly to reach conclusions about the culture, practices 
and ethics of the press, or a section of the press, the converse is not the case: in other words, 
the Inquiry is able to state with confidence that the majority of press practice is good, if not 
very good. The evidential foundation for this conclusion is clear. First, there is the convergent 
evidence received from numerous witnesses over the course of the hearings. Second, there is 
the weight of evidence coming from the press Core Participants. Finally, the Inquiry has been 
able to make its own assessment of the overall quality of the work of the press over a number 
of decades: this is based upon its own reading, assisted in this context by the knowledge and 
experience of the Assessors. Given the quantity of newspaper print produced up and down 
the country day in and day out, no doubt running to thousands of pages, it should be obvious 
that, if the work of the press was not predominantly acceptable, the volume of complaints 
and litigation would be orders of magnitude greater than they have been both historically 
and more recently.

1.8 

The Sun has provided the Inquiry with some hard data which supports this point.3 A large 
issue of The Sun may contain 104 pages and 300 individual items, or even more, adding up to 
nearly 100,000 items over the course of a year. Of this total, fewer than half a dozen a week 
will result in a complaint to the PCC. Even recognising that stories are not always based on 
issues that could give rise to complaint and that, even if they do, many of those who might 
have wished to complain do not do so (whether out of disenchantment with the PCC or a 
reluctance to take on a large and powerful newspaper group), these statistics provide some 
overall support for the proposition that most press practice is good.

1.9 

This reference to ‘good practice’ is intended to cover the work of the press generally, not just 
the work of news desks producing ‘hard’ or serious news. For the avoidance of doubt, here

and is justly esteemed the firmest bulwark of the liberties of this country’

452

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFthe Inquiry has in mind the work of those writing and producing the comment, opinion and 
editorial  sections  of  newspapers; the sports  pages; the show business  and  entertainment 
pages; the features pages; the business and personal finance columns; the crossword and 
games pages etc. This list is not of course exhaustive, and will vary from print title to print 
title, but the general point needs to be reiterated and reinforced.

1.10  Further,  the  term  ‘good  practice’  is  also  intended  to  cover  a  number  of  different  facets 
of  journalistic  practice.  First  is  the  means  by  which  the  material  for  stories  is  obtained, 
investigated, researched and tested for its accuracy. Second, there is the intrinsic interest, 
variety, imagination and quality of the stories, varying according to the tastes and interests 
of  the  newspaper’s  readers.  Perhaps  the  most  compelling  way  of  making  this  point  is 
to  record  that  the  majority  of  newspaper  content  is  stimulating  and  entertaining  for  its 
readers, recognising always that reader X may buy a particular paper for its sports coverage 
whereas reader Y may be more interested in its comment sections. Public taste is eclectic, 
but newspapers are extremely adept in attuning themselves to the viewpoints and various 
interests of the majority of their readers.

1.11 

It is not inconsistent with the recognition that most of press practice is ‘good’ that journalists 
and editors will sometimes make mistakes, including errors of fact and of judgment. Sources, 
even multiple sources, may simply be wrong in a particular case, however right they might 
usually be; journalists might be misled by apparently reliable sources or websites putting out 
incorrect data and information; errors and slips may be made in the heat of the moment, 
in  order  to  meet  a  particular  deadline;  editorial  judgments  may  be  incorrect  in  a  specific 
instance notwithstanding that they may usually be entirely sound. Mistakes of this sort are 
made in every walk of life and are part and parcel of the human condition: depending on all 
relevant factors, they may be entirely consistent with good press practice. But whether or 
not they exemplify good or bad practice at the end of the day will depend on matters such 
as systems for checking information and sources, and the press response when the error is 
pointed out, including press willingness to engage with the complainant and sort things out 
as quickly as possible.

1.12  There are two aspects of press practice which merit particular mention. First, Lionel Barber, 
editor of the Financial Times, emphasised in his evidence that the reputation of his paper 
depended on getting the story right. In the context of financial reporting it may readily be 
understood that accuracy has a special premium, or rather that inaccuracy can be especially 
damaging, but the same general point may fairly be made in relation to the press as a whole. 
Newspapers trade on their reputation; their commercial success ultimately must rest upon 
the reputation they build for honesty, reliability and accuracy. This goes beyond the discussion 
of serious issues of politics or current affairs. A reader passionately interested in football, for 
example, will think twice about paying the cover price if the paper of his choice consistently 
‘gets it wrong’ in relation to stories of interest to him or her.4 Further, the reader will come to 
learn in due course whether stories are true or false. It flows from this that newspapers have 
every incentive to be as honest, reliable and accurate as they can.

1.13  Second, the Inquiry recognises that journalists often work under the pressure of deadlines, 
and  in  such  circumstances  simply  do  not  have  the  luxury  of  triple-checking  sources  or 
satisfying themselves to the point that they are sure beyond reasonable doubt that a story 
is true. This is a factor which must be taken into account, although exactly how far the point 
goes is worthy of careful consideration. For example, however pressing the deadline, a piece 
which would be seriously defamatory if untrue would require careful checking indeed, and 

4 The Inquiry is not in a position to say whether this proposition is equally as accurate for racing tips

453

Chapter 2 | Good PracticeFin the ordinary course prior notice to the subject, before being published. This is always a 
matter of fact and degree, involving the exercise of sound and sensitive judgment.

Good journalism may also entertain

1.14  The Inquiry fully recognises and understands that not all journalism can or should be ‘worthy’ 
or high-minded. If this were some sort of requirement, or even a desirable objective, the 
outcome  would  be  undemocratic  and  ultimately  contrary  to  the  public  interest,  because 
the readers of such a press would not be representative of the range of tastes, educational 
attainments and opinions which constitute modern British society.

1.15  An important section of the press, probably in truth the largest section, must be popular and 
must  entertain.  Even  readers  of  more  highbrow  papers  are  not  interested  only  in  serious 
articles; light and entertaining pieces are all part of the overall package. The same naturally 
applies to an even greater extent in relation to the mid-market and tabloid press, and no one 
is remotely suggesting that this is an unworthy or inappropriate objective.

1.16  Thus, purely entertaining stories serve at least two functions: first, they have value in their 
own  right,  and  accord  pleasure  to  their  readers  on  their  own  terms; second,  they  have  a 
corollary function in attracting readers to the newsstand and in maintaining circulation; and 
the advantageous by-product of both these functions is that readers will participate more 
in  the  democratic  process  by  being  drawn  to  the  news  and  comment  pages  of  the  paper 
which  are  often  skilfully  interwoven  with  the  lighter  sections  and  are  usually  written  in  a 
clear, compelling, user friendly and pungent style.

1.17 

Journalism which has no value other than the fact that it entertains does not require a public 
interest justification provided that its processes of research and preparation, as well as its 
subject matter, do not impinge on the rights of others. Submissions from a number of the 
press Core Participants appear to have come close to suggesting that the Inquiry’s provisional 
view might be that a public interest justification is required for all stories: this is, as I hope 
has been made clear, to misunderstand the Inquiry’s analysis of the issue. A public interest 
justification is required only if rights and interests such as the privacy of private individuals 
may be harmed. In all other cases, subject to issues such as accuracy and the like, the press is 
both entitled and entirely free to publish what it likes in the way that it likes.

1.18  What might or does amount to ‘entertainment’ will naturally vary from paper to paper, and 
no one could or should be remotely prescriptive about this. Here, the issue touches subjective 
matters  of  taste  and  opinion  which,  subject  to  not  overstepping  various  bounds,  must  lie 
solely within the editorial judgment of the newspaper in question.

“on a number of occasions it has been suggested to me that I have not paid sufficient 
attention to the good work of the press. Perhaps that’s an inevitable consequence of 
the terms of reference of the Inquiry, but in order that nobody can suggest that I have 
paid insufficient attention to that aspect, I will invite any title that wishes to submit 
what they perceive to be their top five public interest stories over the last few years, 
merely to reflect the other side of the coin.”

In this section of the report I will address a selection of the public  interest stories drawn 
to my attention by a number of the press Core Participants pursuant to my invitation, and 
consider some specific pieces of evidence referred to in written submissions as illustrative of 
good practice. Not every title responded to my invitation, and in any event not every story 
will be expressly covered below: some of the campaigns which are relied on as evidence of 
‘public interest stories’ are not without controversy, and some are ongoing. I will conclude 
this section with the Daily Telegraph’s MPs’ expenses stories, since much Inquiry time was 
devoted to it from a number of perspectives.

Inevitably, I will be drawing attention to the work of individual titles. I see no difficulty in 
doing this because reference to good practice does not engage in any way what I have been 
calling the mantra and the self-denying ordinance.

I am also drawing heavily on the content and wording of the submissions of the press Core 
Participants. I should accordingly make it clear that by making reference to any particular 
campaign, I should not be interpreted as passing judgment on the merits of that campaign or 
any underlying argument, although I fully recognise the right of the relevant title to campaign 
as it sees fit. Furthermore, it is extremely important that this aspect of the work of the press, 
namely holding public authorities and others to account in ways that an independent mind 
has  perceived  is  in  the  public  interest,  is  recognised  and  appreciated.  When  dealing  with 
practices of sections of the press that I criticise, nothing  should  be taken to detract from 
the role of the press generally to expose wrongdoing, incompetence or inefficiency, and to 
challenge those who make decisions about the way they were reached or basis for them.

Associated Newspapers Limited
The Daily Mail’s written submission is that it is a newspaper which champions causes, fights 
injustice  and  raises  millions  from  generous  readers  to  help  those  facing  real  hardship.  It 
has never been afraid, or frightened, to stand up against injustice, often in difficult or even 
dangerous circumstances.

The following are advanced as examples of public interest campaigns in recent years.

The  first  story  advanced  by  the  Daily  Mail  is  the  Stephen  Lawrence  campaign.  When  the 
prime suspects were acquitted in 1997 of Stephen’s murder in south east London in 1993, 
the Daily Mail took up the case. A front page proclaimed ‘Murderers,’ accused the suspects of 
the crime and printed their pictures. Under a headline: ‘The Mail accuses these men of killing. 
If we are wrong, let them sue us’, the paper effectively challenged the suspects to sue. They 
did not. After the abolition of the rule against double jeopardy and new DNA developments, 
earlier this year two of the suspects were found guilty of his murder.

Second, two years after the 1998 Omagh bombing atrocity, in despair that the killers were 
still at large, devastated families of the 29 people, including the mother of unborn twins who 
had been killed in the outrage, approached the Daily Mail in a final attempt to win justice 
for their loved ones. the Daily Mail, which accused British justice of a ‘shameful betrayal’, 
appealed to its readers and received support across the religious and political divide, raising 
£1.2 million to fund a landmark civil court action. In June 2009, the family finally succeeded 
when a historic Belfast court ruling awarded them more than £1.6 million in damages against 
the four Real IRA terrorists they accused of tearing their lives apart.

2.9 

The  third  campaign  identified  by  the  Daily  Mail  concerns  compensation  for  wounded 
servicemen. In 2007, the Daily Mail highlighted the paltry sums given to injured heroes by 
the Ministry of Defence and launched a campaign focusing on the case of paratrooper Ben 
Parkinson, 24, who lost both legs, the use of one arm, his speech and much of his memory 

455

Chapter 2 | Good PracticeFin a mine blast in Afghanistan. After a year of campaigning, the Government announced it 
was doubling the maximum pay out to the worst injured; this was followed, in 2010, by the 
announcement that compensation for thousands of others badly wounded in the line of duty, 
would also be raised, backdated to 2005.

2.10  Following the devastating tsunami on Boxing Day 2004, an appeal (‘Flood Aid’) by the Daily 
Mail raised nearly £16 million from readers; this was a world record for newspapers. Much 
of  the  money  was  filtered  through  the  Disaster  Emergency  Committee,  which  represents 
major UK-based charities, but the paper also oversaw the rebuilding of a large state school 
for children of the poor in Galle on Sri Lanka’s southern coast and the reconstruction of a 
fishing village in Banda Aceh, together with new boats for fishermen.

2.11  The  Daily  Mail  has  also  drawn  attention  to  the  many  other  successful  campaigns  the 
newspaper has run. Just a few of them are Dignity for the Elderly; Osteoporosis; Alzheimer’s 
drugs; Prostate Cancer Awareness; The £6 million Kosovo Appeal; the £5.5 million Farm Aid 
appeal; The Battle of Britain memorial; Coming Home; and Money Mail’s campaigns to help 
readers get compensation from the banks, from the tax man and from Building Societies.

2.12 

It may readily be understood that Associated Newspapers Ltd’s examples of ‘public interest 
journalism’  are  examples  of  campaigns  which  it  has  pursued  with  enormous  vigour  over 
the years, in each case in the public interest and with ultimate vindication. They illustrate a 
different facet of the vital public importance of the press, no less important than paradigm 
illustrations of investigative reporting. Further, some might argue that the Stephen Lawrence 
campaign  was  not  merely  fraught  with  obvious  risk,  (legal  risk  being  only  one  potential 
concern)  but  it  involved  the  difficult  decision,  raising  serious  public  interest  issues,  as  to 
whether  to  accuse  those  who  had  already  faced  a  criminal  trial  for  a  crime  as  serious  as 
murder (the private prosecutions brought by the Lawrence family having collapsed through 
lack of then available evidence). However, Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail back in 
1997 as he is now, explained why he was prepared to support the Lawrence family in the 
face  of  injustice.  It  must  be  emphasised  that  his  judgment  has  been  entirely  vindicated 
by  subsequent  events,  namely  the  setting  up  of  a  public  inquiry  under  the  Chairmanship 
of Sir William MacPherson (along with its conclusions), the conviction of two men and the 
maintenance of public awareness of the case and its important ramifications.

The Guardian

2.13  Appendix A to the Guardian’s submissions, filed on 23 July 2012, details five recent public 

interest investigations conducted by Guardian News and Media Ltd.6 I set out these in full.

2.14  The first concerns the death of the newspaper seller, Ian Tomlinson. In the days after the 
Mr Tomlinson’s death, during protests over the G20 summit in April 2009, dogged reporting 
by  the  Guardian’s  Paul  Lewis  raised  questions  about  the  police  account  of  the  sequence 
of events leading up to his collapse. The official account was unpicked when the Guardian 
obtained  video  footage  showing  Mr  Tomlinson  being  struck  by  a  police  officer  before  his 
collapse. Mr Lewis’s reporting led to the reversing of the original pathologist’s findings that 
Mr Tomlinson died of natural causes, an inquest returning a verdict of unlawful killing, and 
the prosecution (and subsequent acquittal) of a police officer for manslaughter.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF2.15  The second Guardian story concerns the tax gap. In a two week series of articles based on 
several  months  of  investigation,  a  Guardian  team  in  February  2009  revealed  how  leading 
companies including Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline and Shell were using a range of highly complex 
offshore devices to avoid paying millions in UK tax. The reports involved the Guardian in a 
legal battle with Barclays, which sought to prevent publication of documents outlining its tax 
avoidance schemes, and later led to the Government taking significant steps to crack down 
on tax avoidance.

2.16  The third story relates to the oil trading firm, Trafigura. In May 2009, The Guardian acquired 
a confidential document which suggested that the waste dumped from a tanker chartered by 
Trafigura in the Ivory Coast port of Abidjan was highly toxic. A large number of local residents 
became  sick.  Trafigura  later  attempted  to  gag  the  paper  by  seeking  a  super-injunction, 
preventing not just publication of the key document but even reporting of an MP’s question 
about it. After a public campaign the super-injunction was lifted; Trafigura was later convicted 
by  a  Dutch  court  with  regard  to  the  delivery  of  the  toxic  waste  to,  and  its  export  from, 
Amsterdam and fined 1 million Euros. The company is appealing the decision.

2.17  The Guardian also refers to its campaign in relation to rendition and torture of detainees. For 
more than five years and in scores of articles, The Guardian’s Ian Cobain has painstakingly 
uncovered  the  extent  of  Britain’s  complicity  in  the  torture  and  rendition  of  detainees  in 
the face of countless official denials. Mr Cobain has linked Britain to the mistreatment of 
prisoners in Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Mr Cobain’s reporting was one 
of the key factors leading to the Government’s decision to order an inquiry into allegations of 
British complicity in torture, now delayed until police investigation of two cases is complete.

2.18  Although  the  underlying  disclosures  by  WikiLeaks  remain  potentially  controversial,  the 
Guardian’s collaboration with whistleblowers’ website WikiLeaks and four other international 
newspapers in 2010 and 2011 led to the publication of a string of major public interest stories 
touching almost every corner of the globe. They included the disclosure that Saudi Arabia 
was secretly putting pressure on the US to attack Iran, that US diplomats believed Russia 
was “a virtual Mafia state” and that a British oil company claimed to have “infiltrated” all of 
Nigeria’s major ministries. The role played by the Guardian, however, is not controversial: 
it played a central part in ensuring that hundreds of thousands of documents which might 
have been dumped “raw” on the Internet were carefully analysed first and redacted to avoid 
exposure  of  vulnerable  sources.  More  than  30  Guardian  specialist  reporters  and  foreign 
correspondents were involved in the huge effort to comb and authenticate the documents 
over several months.

2.19  The  Guardian  might  also  have  drawn  specific  attention  to  the  work  of  Nick  Davies  in 
investigating the phone hacking story over a number of years, culminating in the revelations 
of July 2011 which led directly to the setting up of this Inquiry. The criticisms made of that 
report are analysed in the case study dealing with the murder of Milly Dowler.

2.20 

In  my  view,  these  are  all  excellent  examples  of  public  interest  investigative  journalism, 
properly so called: in other words, the unearthing of the often unpalatable truth by dogged 
hard work and persistence. This is different to the conduct of a campaign for or on behalf 
of  causes  which  meet  a  newspaper’s  particular  agenda.  The  latter  may  well  discharge  an 
important public interest function in the drawing of attention to worthwhile causes which 
would not otherwise have crossed the public’s radar and may have no less importance, but 
the nature and quality of the journalism involved is somewhat different. Nor do I lose sight of 
the point that campaigning journalism might be much more controversial on the basis that it 

457

Chapter 2 | Good PracticeFis capable of dividing public opinion; here, the newspaper is providing its own megaphone to 
amplify the volume in relation to causes its editors or proprietors happen to favour.

Northern & Shell

2.21  The Daily Star, the Daily Star Sunday, the Daily Express and the Sunday Express have supplied 
the  Inquiry  with  copies  of  a  considerable  number  of  articles  which  comprise  examples  of 
good journalistic practice, whether it be campaigning journalism, investigative journalism, or 
a combination of the two. I propose to set out a representative sample below.

2.22  Both  the  Daily  Express  and  the  Sunday  Express  have  mounted  a  campaign  for  veterans 
of  Bomber  Command  to  be  accorded  greater  recognition  in  view  of  their  and  their  late 
colleagues’ service and sacrifice during the Second World War. This campaign has included 
pressing for veterans to be issued with the Second World War Campaign Medal, and for a 
Bomber Command Memorial to be inaugurated. On 28 June 2012, HM The Queen unveiled 
such a memorial in recognition of the 55,573 aircrew who lost their lives in the Second World 
War and the Daily Express published a souvenir edition to mark this event.

2.23  The Inquiry’s attention has also been drawn to a number of stories in the Sunday Express 
relating  to  a  scandal  uncovered  by  the  newspaper  whereby  social  workers  were  “sexing 
up” documents to give local authorities the power to take thousands of children from their 
families and put them up for adoption, so as to meet flawed Government targets. The paper 
is also responsible for an ongoing campaign to achieve a greater understanding and openness 
in the discussion and treatment of mental illness.

2.24  A number of impressive public interest stories have been run by the Daily Star Sunday, but the 
following examples will suffice for present purposes. First, the newspaper ran several articles 
exposing the activities of the English Defence League (EDL) and contending that they could 
legitimately be described as dangerous thugs. When it appeared that the EDL was getting 
a  groundswell  of  support  among  working  class  people,  the  newspaper  continued  running 
strongly worded editorials criticising the group and exposing the criminal records of several 
of their members. More recently, the newspaper’s investigators spent months working on the 
scandal of PIP breast implants, speaking to victims and experts to ascertain the dangers the 
implants pose. Key successes include uncovering for the first time a detailed list of ingredients 
contained in the implants.

2.25  A  third  public  interest  inquiry  was  mounted  which,  on  two  occasions,  revealed  that  the 
paper had found IT blunders by Government workers who placed restricted information in 
the public domain by failing adequately to redact them so that the restricted information 
was not revealed. These stories have led to a change in the way certain departments redact 
documents.

2.26  Fourth, the newspaper seeks to have an article each week covering the human side of the 
wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  Following  complaints  about  the  quality  of  equipment  the 
servicemen were using, the Daily Star Sunday (along with other newspapers) wrote a series of 
articles calling for improvements to be made. These stories led to a marked improvement in 
equipment, including the decommissioning of so called Snatch Land Rovers. The fifth example 
is that the paper has been investigating unpublicised dangers surrounding Tamiflu for many 
months, after it found it had been linked to the deaths of 13 people. The newspaper exposed 
links between the licensing authority and the drug-maker, and has documented numerous 
complaints from patients affected by the drug.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFThe Sun

2.27  The Sun’s written submissions and evidence refer to a number of its campaigns,7 and I have 
borne these well in mind, recognising the arguable public interest in bringing these matters 
to the attention of their readers at the particular time. But, rather than setting these out 
specifically, I believe that it is more valuable at this stage to refer to some of the evidence 
given by its current editor, Dominic Mohan.

2.28  The  first  example  of  true  public  interest  journalism  concerns  neither  investigation  nor 
campaigning. Rather, it is to explain extremely complex concepts of vital public importance. 
By way of example, Mr Mohan referred to an article published on 27 July 2011 in which The 
Sun gave a succinct description of the state of the Eurozone bailout crisis, saying that the 
majority of working people in the UK preferred to read “a really concise and well-executed 
spread ... which gives them very quick, digestible summary of very, very complex issues”.8 He 
said that such reporting in The Sun was how “millions of people learn of serious issues on a 
daily basis”.9 Nobody can pretend that the issues at stake are straightforward and there is no 
doubt that journalism of this type is of a very high order.

2.29  Mr  Mohan  also  referred  with  pride  to  The  Sun’s  science  reporting.  He  mentioned  his 
engagement of Professor Brian Cox as “The Sun’s Professor”. He writes for The Sun “on very 
complex issues like the Hadron Collider and digests them into very accessible chunks for the 
readers”.10 He also referred to praise for The Sun’s science coverage by the Science Media 
Centre:11 its director, Fiona Fox, said Professor Cox was “wonderful”. She said that he and 
others who write on science for tabloids are “genius” and went on “every single day they 
communicate very complicated and very important science to a mass audience”.12

2.30  The Sun has also provided good illustrations of public interest stories which may fairly be 
described as examples of investigative journalism.13 These can best be identified by reference 
to the headline and story: no further comment is necessary.

2.31  “We smash poison doc’s prison plot to kill ex and baby” (14 May and 16 June 2012). The 
Sun revealed how a doctor, already jailed for six years for drugging his mistress to try and 
force a miscarriage, was planning a revenge plot to kill her and her baby. In an undercover 
investigation,  reporters  from  The  Sun  asked  another  convict  secretly  to  film  the  doctor, 
Edward Erin, explaining his plan. The evidence was handed to the police and as a direct result 
Erin was jailed for an additional two years.

2.32  “Court in the act – clerk brags of £500 bribes to wipe records of dangerous drivers” (4 August 
2011 and 19 November 2011). After a tip-off that a Magistrates Court clerk was offering to 
wipe clean convicted drivers’ licences, The Sun mounted an undercover operation to test the 
allegation. The Sun reporter sought and won approval from the editor and The Sun’s legal

of  the  Bribery  Act  2010,  which  came  into  force  the  previous  month.14  The  evidence  was 
handed to police and the clerk, Munir Patel, became the first person to be convicted under 
the Bribery Act 2010; he was subsequently imprisoned for six years.

2.33  “Maddie  fraudster  nicked”  (25  November  2009).  Kevin  Halligen  was  a  private  detective 
employed by Drs Gerry and Kate McCann to help find their missing daughter. He swindled 
their charitable fund of £300,000 and went on the run after being accused of a £2 million 
fraud for which he was wanted in the US. The Sun tracked him down, he was arrested and he 
has now lost his appeal against extradition.

2.34  “We’re in jail, dude”, (6 February 2007). The Sun revealed the secret cockpit tape from a US 
jet which attacked a British convoy and killed a British soldier, Lance Corporal Matty Hull, in 
a friendly fire incident during the Iraq war. The Ministry of Defence had failed to produce the 
video at the inquest into Lance Corporal Hull’s death. But, as a result of The Sun’s investigation, 
the Coroner was able to deliver a verdict of unlawful killing.

2.35 

The Sunday Times
It is impossible not to mention the extremely well known exposure of the effect of the drug 
Thalidomide in the 1970s and the campaign against Distillers (spearheaded by the then editor, 
Sir  Harold  Evans)  as  one  of  the  most  outstanding  examples  of  persistent  and  challenging 
journalism. It exemplifies both investigative and campaigning journalism and stands as an 
example of the power and effectiveness of the press at its very best. The much more recent 
illustrations put in evidence by The Sunday Times15 are also good examples of investigative 
journalism which can have a campaigning effect. Once again, it is sufficient to illustrate them 
by reference to the headline and story.

2.36  “Tory treasurer charges £250,000 to meet PM” (Insight, 25 March 2012). The co-treasurer of 
the Conservative party, Peter Cruddas, was filmed by Sunday Times reporters selling secret 
meetings  with  the  Prime  Minister  for  donations  of  £250,000.  He  offered  a  lobbyist  and 
undercover reporters, posing as overseas clients, direct access to the Prime Minister if they 
joined a “premier league” of party donors. Mr Cruddas resigned within hours of the story 
being published and Mr Cameron came under intense pressure to disclose the identities of 
all donors who had been entertained privately at Downing Street.

2.37  “Vet offers only hope for Syrian wounded” and “We live in fear of a massacre”, (19 February 
2012). The last despatch from Marie Colvin, the renowned Sunday Times war correspondent, 
revealed the scale and depth of suffering among the 28,000 civilians caught up in the Syrian 
army’s shelling of the Babr Amr district of Homs. Ms Colvin was killed by a rocket on 22 February 
2012,  three  days  after  her  story  was  published,  provoking  international  condemnation  of 
President Assad’s regime and adding impetus to the efforts to secure Russian and Chinese 
backing for political transition in Damascus.

2.38  “Revealed: the full horror of Misrata”, (10 April 2011). The Sunday Times foreign reporter 
Hala Jaber boarded a gun runners’ trawler to get to the Libyan port of Misrata after it was 
besieged and bombarded for weeks with no independent access for journalists. She found 
a city in desperate need of humanitarian and military help. Her front page report increased

anyone would consider there to be a public interest in prosecuting the journalist in these circumstances

Gadaffi’s forces in the area.

2.39  “World  Cup  votes  for  sale”  (Insight,  October  2010).  The  Sunday  Times  reporters  exposed 
corruption in the FIFA voting process which decides who will host the football World Cup. 
During  an  investigation  that  lasted  three  months  and  involved  travel  to  three  continents, 
the undercover team discovered six senior FIFA officials, past and present, who offered to 
work as fixers and suggested paying huge bribes to FIFA executive members. One executive 
member asked for £500,000 for a personal project, another asked for £1.5 million for a sports 
academy. As a result, eight officials were suspended for between one and four years and, in 
future, every member country will have a vote on which country should host the World Cup 
rather than the decision being left to a secretive 24 man committee.

The Telegraph
In written submissions filed on 2 May 2012, Telegraph Media Group Ltd drew attention to 
a number of recent public interest stories.16 Pride of place goes to the MPs’ expenses story 
which is covered under a separate heading below. Again, the stories speak for themselves.

‘Baby Girls Aborted: No Questions Asked’.17 An undercover investigation by The Daily Telegraph 
disclosed that women were being offered illegal sex selection abortions. Doctors were secretly 
filmed  offering  to  abort  foetuses  purely  because  they  were  either  male  or  female,  even 
though it is illegal to carry out a termination for that reason. One doctor, a consultant who 
works for both private clinics and NHS hospitals in Manchester, told a pregnant woman who 
said she wanted to abort a female foetus, “I don’t ask questions. If you want a termination, 
you want a termination”. She later telephoned a colleague to book the procedure, explaining 
that it was for “social reasons” and the woman “doesn’t want questions asked”. The Daily 
Telegraph’s investigation also recorded several other doctors at clinics in other parts of the 
country offering similar terminations based on the unborn baby’s gender. The consequence 
of this exposure is that there are now three separate and ongoing police investigations by the 
Metropolitan, Greater Manchester and West Midlands police forces. In addition, the matter is 
being pursued in separate professional investigations by the General Medical Council and the 
Nursing and Midwifery Council. Finally, the Care Quality Commission has made unannounced 
inspections at more than 250 abortion clinics.

‘Cheating the System: How Examiners Tip off Teachers’.18 An undercover investigation disclosed 
that teachers were paying to attend seminars with chief examiners where they were advised 
on examination questions. One examiner was recorded telling the teachers what examination 
questions to expect and admitted “we’re cheating”. The investigation exposed a system in 
which examination boards aggressively competed for “business” from schools. Evidence was 
uncovered that standards of examinations had been driven down to encourage schools to 
enter pupils for particular boards. The Chief Examiner of one examination board told one 
undercover reporter that “there is so little content we don’t know how we got it through” and 
in an attempt to win new business told him “we don’t have to teach a lot”. This investigation 
had an impact on millions of children across the country and the teaching profession. The 
Secretary of State for Education, Rt Hon Michael Gove, welcomed The Telegraph’s investigation 
and  there  is  now  a  fundamental  review  of  the  examination  system,  and  an  inquiry  being 
conducted by the Education Select Committee in the House of Commons.

‘Inquiry  into  Stem  Cell  Clinic  that  offers  help  to  Sick  and  Disabled’.19  This  was  a  Sunday 
Telegraph undercover investigation at Europe’s largest stem cell clinic, which was taking tens 
of thousands of pounds from the most vulnerable in society for unproven clinical treatments. 
The XCell-Centre clinic, in Germany, became the centre of a scandal following the revelation 
that it was conducting stem cell transplants which are illegal in Britain and most of Europe. 
Hundreds of British patients travel there each year. A Sunday Telegraph reporter was told that, 
if he underwent treatment at that clinic, there was a chance that he could be able walk again. 
The paper also uncovered that an 18 month old baby died and another was seriously injured 
following transplant of stem cells into their brains. The Sunday Telegraph investigation led to 
the clinic being closed by the German authorities but the paper and its journalists persisted 
with a follow up inquiry. These further investigations (reported in the paper in spring 2012) 
reveal that the chief executive and founder of the German clinic had now established another 
clinic in Lebanon.

‘Chronic Lack of Equipment Puts Soldiers’ Lives at Risk’.20 In June 2007, the Daily Telegraph 
first disclosed worrying information about the lives of servicemen being at risk due to what 
it  described  as  “woefully  inadequate”  resources.  The  paper  highlighted  serious  supply 
problems and failures of equipment, such as the fact that only 70% of Chinook helicopters 
were  available  for  use,  only  50%  of  Apache  helicopters  were  working  and  soldiers  were 
buying  their  own  binoculars  as  the  Army  supplied  ones  were  inadequate.  The  Telegraph 
papers continue to report of worrying problems of this kind. Since the Coalition Government 
came into power, Telegraph revelations have included a private letter sent by the Defence 
Secretary warning the Prime Minister that “draconian” cuts in the defence budget cannot be 
carried out without “grave consequences”. There continues to be strong Parliamentary and 
public interest in these issues.

The Times

2.45  The Times has provided its view of the top five public interests stories published by the paper 
in the recent past. They are listed in evidence21 and it is sufficient to select four examples. 
Headline and story provide sufficient detail.

2.46  The tax avoiders (19–21 June 2012). An undercover investigation by Times reporters revealed 
that thousands of wealthy people in Britain pay as little as 1% income tax. The comedian 
Jimmy Carr and members of the pop group Take That were named among those who used a 
Jersey based tax scheme that shelters £168 million from Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC). As a result of The Times articles, the Prime Minister condemned Mr Carr’s conduct 
and Mr Carr promised to conduct his financial affairs “much more responsibly”. HMRC also 
vowed to shut down the “K2 scheme” used by Mr Carr and more than 1,000 others.

2.47  “Fox in dock over links with “bogus aide”” (8–15 October 2011). Times reporters revealed that 
Adam Werrity, a defence consultant and friend of Liam Fox, the former Defence Secretary, 
was accompanying Dr Fox on trips around the world despite having no official role at the 
Ministry of Defence. The disclosures led directly to the resignation of Dr Fox.

2.48  The Times’ Adoption Campaign, (April 2011). This Times investigation exposed the ways in 
which the adoption system had become riddled with delay and inertia, and how that had

and case studies, The Times commissioned Martin Narey, the former director-general of the 
Prison Service, to analyse the system and recommend reforms. The response was swift. First, 
in July 2011, the Government appointed Mr Narey as its first ministerial adviser on adoption 
with a remit to drive up the number of adoptions, especially at the worst performing local 
authorities. Then, in October 2011, the Prime Minister intervened to promise radical reform 
of  the  system.  Finally,  in  December 2011, the  Government  announced  it  would  scrap  the 
bureaucratic assessment process for would-be adoptive parents and replace it with a more 
streamlined system.

2.49  “Israel rains fire on Gaza with phosphorus shells” (5 January 2009). The Times revealed that 
the Israeli Defence Force was using white phosphorus shells during an offensive over one of 
the most densely populated areas of the world. The shells, which can cause horrific burns, are 
banned under the Geneva Treaty of 1980 as a weapon of war in civilian areas, but not if they 
are used as a smokescreen. Human rights groups accused the Israelis of war crimes.

MPs’ expenses

2.50  Over the years, there have been many examples of journalism at its best, resulting in ground 
breaking  stories  of  national  and  international  importance.  The  examples  provided  to  the 
Inquiry by press Core Participants are no more than illustrative; and they are intended to 
underline  that  most  journalists  go  about  their  work  with  legal  and  ethical  principles  very 
much  in  mind,  and  are  willing  to  test  the  product  of  their  work  against  what  the  public 
interest truly demands. It is not the intention of the Inquiry to identify what has been ‘the 
best’ or ‘the most important’ story but, without putting any one above any other, it is worth 
examining one of the recent ground breaking stories in a little detail, if only to demonstrate 
good practice and the proper exercise of editorial discretion.

2.51  On 8 May 2009, the Daily Telegraph published the first of a number of articles that detailed 
the  expenses  and  allowance  claims  made  by  MPs  over  a  period  of  four  years  from  2004-
2008.22 These claims contained a significant number of what were said to be fraudulent claims 
that breached both Parliamentary rules on expenses and allowances and, in some cases, the 
criminal law. The Telegraph’s exposé preceded the formal publication of data relating to MPs’ 
expenses and allowances by Parliament by a number of months. The data that formed the 
basis of the Telegraph’s stories was contained on one disk, supplied by an undisclosed source 
in exchange for payment of approximately £110,000. Representatives of the Daily Telegraph 
have told the Inquiry that, before deciding to buy the material, they satisfied themselves that 
the material was not, in fact, stolen and that its acquisition was not in breach of the criminal 
law.23

2.52  The  disclosure  by  the  Telegraph  of  MPs’  expenses  claims  was  the  subject  of  intense  and 
extended media coverage and, indeed, public debate. The scale of wrong doing was quickly 
recognised by the then leaders of the major political parties. Such was the public outrage at 
the steady disclosure of expenses claims that MPs appeared to have tried to keep out of the 
public domain that, almost immediately, senior politicians offered an unreserved apology to 
the public. On 11 May 2009, the then Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown, apologised 

22 In the United Kingdom MPs can claim expenses, including the cost of accommodation, “wholly, exclusively and 
necessarily incurred for the performance of a Member’s parliamentary duties”. In the tax year 2007–2008, MPs’ cost of 
staying away from their main homes was limited to £23,083

Chapter 2 | Good PracticeF“on behalf of all politicians” for the expenses claims that had been made. Later that day, the 
Leader of the Conservative Party, Rt Hon David Cameron, said that all MPs should apologise 
for the expenses scandal. He told the BBC that the system of expenses “was wrong and we’re 
sorry about it”.24 On 12 May, Mr Cameron went further in his criticism of the claims made by 
some MPs and said that these were also “unethical and wrong.”25 In a statement made to 
the House of Commons, the then Speaker of the House, Michael Martin, said that “serious 
change” was required in the future and that MPs should not just work within the rules, but 
rather in “the spirit of what is right”.26

2.53  The impact of the revelations was significant. There was an immediate loss of confidence in 
the political system generally and in the established mainstream political parties in particular. 
This was most clearly manifest in an unprecedented spike in support for minority political 
parties.  It  was  also  reflected  in  the  observations  of  leading  commentators  and  thinkers. 
The editor of The Times, James Harding, called the unfolding scandal Parliament’s “darkest 
hour”.27 On 23 May 2009, in a speech on the potential impact of the revelations on political 
life, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, warned that:28

“the continuing systematic humiliation of politicians itself threatens to carry a heavy 
price in terms of our ability to salvage some confidence in our democracy.”

Writing the same day in The Times, the columnist and former Conservative MP, Matthew 
Parris, suggested that:29

“extravagance, genuine mistake, sly acquisitiveness and outright criminal fraud are 
now jumbled together in the national mind as though there were no moral differences”.

Background

2.54  The publication of the details of expenses claims was neither the beginning nor the end of 
journalistic interest in the subject. Journalists had sought to uncover the detail of claims made 
by MPs through the use of powers granted under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 which 
had come into force in October 2004. The first requests for publication of MPs’ receipts date 
back to January 2005. Then, journalists Ben Leapman of The Sunday Telegraph, Jon Ungoed-
Thomas of The Sunday Times, and the freedom of information campaigner and journalist, 
Heather Brooke, submitted Freedom of Information requests relating to the expenses of 14 
MPs, including the then Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the then Conservative front bencher, 
George Osborne.30 These requests were twice rejected by the House of Commons authorities 
before they were appealed to the Information Commissioner, by Mr Leapman, Mr Ungoed-
Thomas and Ms Brooke, in the spring of 2005.31

2.55  The then Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, considered the three separate requests 
jointly for two years before, on 13 June 2007, deciding that the requested information should 
be disclosed.32 He ruled that the disclosure should be in abridged and aggregated form and

Information Commissioner’s decision was appealed by the House of Commons authorities 
later that month.33 They argued that the disclosure would be “unlawfully intrusive”.34 The 
case was passed to the Information Tribunal to decide. The journalists who had submitted the 
original requests also appealed the decision.

2.56  Two  months  previously,  in  May  2007,  a  majority  of  MPs  had  voted  for  the  Freedom  of 
Information (Amendment) Bill introduced by the Conservative MP, David MacClean, which 
proposed to exempt MPs from the terms of the 2000 Act. The Bill was withdrawn shortly 
before its second reading in the House of Lord’s as peers were not willing to sponsor the bill.35 
Although unsuccessful, this was the first of three attempts by Parliamentarians to restrict the 
application of the Freedom of Information Act to Parliament ahead of the formal publication 
of MPs’ expenses claims. In July 2008, amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 2004 
were passed by Parliament. These exempted the addresses of Members of Parliament from 
the terms of the Act. Lastly, in January 2009, Harriet Harman QC MP, then the Leader of the 
House of Commons, tabled a motion intended to exempt expenses claims from disclosure 
under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act.  Although  Government  MPs  were  placed  under  a 
three line whip, opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs opposed the motion. On 
21 January 2009, the proposals were formally dropped by the Government.

2.57 

In February 2008, the Information Tribunal published its decision on MPs’ expenses, rejecting 
the  defence  put  forward  by  the  House  of  Commons  authorities.36  Further,  it  ordered  the 
release of information on 14 MPs.37 The hearings that led to the decision were not without 
further controversy: in particular, there were revelations around the content of the so called 
John Lewis list which set out the amounts that could be claimed for particular items without 
question or justification. The items on the list were benchmarked against the purchase price 
for such items at the John Lewis department store chain.

2.58  The decision of the Information Tribunal to order the publication of expenses was the subject 
of an immediate appeal to the High Court by a small number of senior MPs representing each 
of the main political parties. On 16 May 2008, the court ruled that the requested details of 
MPs expenses should be released.38 Moreover, the High Court also ruled that further details 
not included in the original order made by the Information Commissioner should be disclosed, 
including addresses. Following the High Court ruling, no further appeal was lodged and, on 
23 May 2008, the expense claims of 14 MPs, including the former Prime Minister Tony Blair 
and the Foreign Secretary, Margaret Beckett, were made public.

2.59  The ruling of the High Court and the subsequent disclosure of the expenses of the 14 MPs 
named in the test case, did not lead directly to or necessarily expedite the publication of the 
expenses claims of all MPs scheduled by the House of Commons authorities. It had been 
intended that publication would take place in November 2008 but the date of the release 
of the information was pushed back until the summer of 2009, ostensibly to allow for the

Chapter 2 | Good PracticeFproper collation of the data.39 In April 2009, the House of Commons authorities announced 
that publication of expenses, with certain information deemed “sensitive” removed, would 
take place in July 2009.40

2.60  On 18 June 2009, more than one month after the first disclosures in the Daily Telegraph, 
the details of all MPs’ expenses and allowance claims approved by the House of Commons 
authorities during the period from 2004 to 2008 were published on the official Parliament 
website.  However,  a  number  of  details,  including  personal  data  such  as  addresses,  were 
redacted.  The  published  data  also  excluded  claims  made  by  Parliamentarians  that  had 
not been approved for payment by the House of Commons authorities, as well as related 
correspondence between MPs and the Parliamentary fees office. These omissions resulted 
in  further  allegations  in  the  press  of  unnecessary  secrecy,  and  also  served  to  confirm  an 
increasingly  widespread  suspicion  that  the  most  serious  abuses  of  the  expenses  system 
would not have come to light had the redacted documentation been the only information 
available. Details of voluntary repayments by MPs amounting to almost £500,000 were also 
published by the House of Commons authorities.41

2.61 

It is noteworthy that shortly after the publication of the first of the disclosures in the Daily 
Telegraph, the House of Commons authorities asked the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), 
to investigate the journalistic activities of the paper. This request was declined by the MPS on 
the grounds that a prosecution would not, in any event, be in the public interest (although, 
as identified above, the then editor of the Daily Telegraph made clear in his evidence that the 
advice that he received was that no criminal act had taken place).42

Disclosure by the Daily Telegraph: the story

2.62  On 30 April 2009, the Daily Telegraph obtained access to a full copy of all expenses claims 
made by MPs between 2004 and 2008. This data had been purchased from a middleman, 
Major John Wick, for the sum of approximately £110,000. The material had also been offered 
to other newspapers including The Times and The Sun. Mr Harding confirmed in evidence 
that  his  newspaper  decided  against  purchasing  the  information  because  of  concerns  that 
it may have been stolen.43 The Daily Telegraph began publishing in instalments, from 8 May 
2009, the details of expenses claimed by certain MPs.

2.63  Mr  Lewis  has  given  evidence  at  length  to  the  Inquiry  about  the  process  which  led  to  the 
purchase of the material by the Daily Telegraph. He said that the decision to purchase and 
publish  the  material  was  iterative:  senior  management  at  the  newspaper  were  consulted 
throughout  and  fully  aware  of  the  need  to  establish  the  provenance  and  legality  of  the 
material, as well as the need to make most effective use of the limited ten day’s worth of 
access to the data that the Daily Telegraph had purchased in the first instance.44 Mr Lewis also 
made clear that conditions based on fairness and impartiality were attached to the sale of the 
material by the seller.45 Mr Lewis has said that he was mindful that the need to meet those

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFconditions determined the scope and sequencing of the eventual publication of the material 
from 8 May.46

2.64  Mr Lewis told the Inquiry that the purchase and publication of data was a “story laced with 
risk”.47 He said that those risks existed on a number of levels. First, senior management at 
the Daily Telegraph were worried that the material may have been fabricated as part of an 
elaborate hoax. He suggested that the memory of The Sunday Times’ publication of ‘the Hitler 
diaries’ in the early 1980s48 had cast a long shadow over many of those who were in some 
way involved with that story.49 Mr Lewis said that the legality of the data was also a serious 
consideration. However, Mr Lewis’ position was that there was an overriding public interest 
in  ensuring  that  the  data  entered  the  public  domain,  and  in  exposing  what  he  described 
as “profound wrong-doing at the heart of the House of Commons”,50 as well as to ensure 
that readers were informed about how the “MPs were fleecing the taxpayer”.51 Further, Mr 
Lewis told the Inquiry that the decision to publish was justified because the official disclosure 
of  these  expenses  claims  by  the  House  of  Commons  authorities  would  have  omitted  key 
information, particularly around the re-designation of second-home nominations. Mr Lewis 
confirmed that the public interest in publishing data, rather than any commercial value or 
advantage to  the newspaper, was  the determining  factor in  the decision  to  purchase and 
publish the data.52

2.65  Aside  from  the  advice  on  the  criminal  law  which  the  Daily  Telegraph  received,  Mr  Lewis 
explained that there were further legal considerations that the newspaper had to overcome 
ahead of publication of the material. Specifically, these were around the conditions set down 
by the source of the data, and focused on payment for the data, the legal protection of the 
source and the fair and balanced treatment of the material.53

2.66  For Mr Lewis, the greatest challenge faced by the newspaper was in the analysis of the data 
itself within the initial ten day time-frame permitted under the terms of the sale.54 This, Mr 
Lewis said, was undertaken by a dedicated MPs’ expenses team working solely and secretly 
on the data.55 The team examined more than 1 million documents on the disk, representing 
about half of the total data set.56 There followed serious consideration with colleagues at 
the paper as to how best to ensure that the revelation of the data was fair and balanced. 
In addition, the newspaper wrote to the MPs concerned in order to seek confirmation from 
them of the veracity of the claims. It was only when the then Justice Secretary, the Rt Hon 
Jack Straw MP, responded to the paper confirming the detail of his claims and providing an 
explanation for them that Mr Lewis felt sufficiently confident to proceed with publication of 
the story.57

467

Chapter 2 | Good PracticeF2.67  The Daily Telegraph revealed details of these expenses sequentially.58 The first revelations 
concerned  the  expenses  of  the  then  governing  Labour  Party,59  beginning  with  the  claims 
made by members of the Cabinet.60 Details of claims made by junior ministers and Labour 
backbenchers  followed.  A  further  tranche  of  expenses  claims  made  by  Labour  MPs  was 
published on 14 May.61 In order to provide the fairness and balance imposed as a condition 
of purchase, the coverage did not focus exclusively on claims which had been made by the 
then Government. On 11 and 12 May, the Daily Telegraph revealed details of the expenses 
claimed by members of the Front Bench of the Conservative Party,62 followed by the claims 
of backbench Conservative MPs. The expenses claims made by Liberal Democrat MPs were 
revealed last of the three main parties.63

Areas of abuse

2.68 

In addition to the exposition and publication of specific allegations of incorrect claims, including 
claims for the cost of mortgages already repaid in full, the Daily Telegraph also set out alleged 
abuses  of  the  Parliamentary  “Green  Book”  rules  on  expenses  and  allowances.  These,  the 
newspaper rightly contended, provided considerable scope for a number of different abuses. 
In particular, the abuses set out by the Daily Telegraph related to costs of maintaining two 
residences, one in the constituency and one in London. Other alleged abuses brought to the 
public attention by the Daily Telegraph included (but were not limited to):
•  nominating second homes: the Green Book states that “the location of your main home 
will normally be a matter of fact”. MPs and peers were able to ensure that their second 
home was the one which enabled them to claim more expenses;

•  redesignating second homes: MPs were able to switch the designation of their second 
home, enabling them to claim for purchasing, renovating and furnishing more than one 
property. This practice has become known as “flipping”;

•  subsidising property development: the Green Book rule that MPs could not claim for 
repairs “beyond making good dilapidations” was not enforced, and consequently MPs 
were able to add significantly to the value of a property. By implication some “second 
homes” were effectively businesses not homes since they were renovated on expenses 
and then rapidly sold;

•  claiming expenses while living in “grace and favour” homes: Ministers with “grace and 
favour” homes in Westminster were also able to claim for a “second home” as well as 
their existing primary residence;

•  overclaiming for food: MPs were permitted to claim up to £400 for food each month 

without receipts, even when Parliament was not sitting; and

•  overspending at the end of the financial year: MPs were able to submit claims just be-
fore the end of the financial year, so as to use up allowances, without being challenged 
as to their legitimacy.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFParliamentary reaction

2.69  The expenses claims disclosed by the Daily Telegraph and subsequent public anger at the 
behaviour of MPs led to substantial changes to the manner in which Parliamentary expenses 
and allowances were administered. On 20 May 2009, Ms Harman, announced the creation of 
the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to manage Parliamentarians’ expenses 
independently of any interference from Parliament.64 Further, an independent Panel chaired 
by  Sir  Thomas  Legg  was  established  to  examine  all  claims  relating  to  the  second  home 
allowance between 2004 and 2008. The panel published its findings on 12 October 2009 as 
MPs returned to Parliament following the summer recess.65 Many claims that had previously 
been regarded as legitimate were now considered to have breached the rules.

Consequences

2.70  As a direct result of the Daily Telegraph’s exposé:

(a) 

(b) 
(c) 

four MPs and two peers have been imprisoned; some peers have been excluded from 
the Lords’ Chamber until repayment of their claims; and one former MP has been found 
unfit to stand trial, although in a trial of issue the jury found that she had committed 
false accounting and used false instruments;
several other MPs remain subject to police investigation;
there was the biggest shift in the composition of Parliament for a generation, with more 
than 100 MPs announcing their intention to retire or leave the House of Commons;
six ministers resigned or were reshuffled amid controversy over their expense claims;
(d) 
(e) 
the first resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons in generations occurred;
(f)  more than £1 million in taxpayers’ money has been returned to Parliamentary authorities 

(g) 

(h) 

by MPs;
a new transparent system with an independent regulator was established. In its first 
year, the new system led to a reduction in the cost of the MPs’ expenses scheme of 
£15 million; and
in  addition,  the  investigation  led  to  wide  areas  of  Government  expenditure  being 
opened up to public scrutiny and the acceptance that, as the Prime Minister put it: 
‘sunlight is the best disinfectant’.

2.71  The Daily Telegraph’s detractors might say that the story brought the paper a huge publicity 
coup and the inevitable increases in circulation and sales: all the ingredients of a modern 
succès  du  scandale.  Rupert  Murdoch  expressed  his  ‘disappointment’  that  The  Times  had 
not felt able to buy up the story from the middleman when he was touting it around the 
market place. Overall, however, the Daily Telegraph earned whatever commercial advantages 
it secured from its substantial financial investment. Although it might be stretching language 
somewhat to call this a case of investigative journalism in the exact sense of the term (the 
material was effectively handed to the Daily Telegraph on a metaphorical plate and did not 
need to be rooted out in the manner of a Thalidomide investigation) the obvious public interest 
in the story and the fact that it was undeniably ‘laced with risk’ deserve full recognition. The 
data might have been bogus; there was certainly an issue as to whether some breach of the

in which the data had been extracted and supplied); and a vast amount of work had to be 
undertaken to analyse and review the raw material not least to ensure accuracy. The legal 
and ethical issues were properly and responsibly addressed, and the Inquiry is fully satisfied 
that no corners were cut. This, as I am pleased to repeat, is an example of journalism at its 
best.

As a prelude to the more detailed assessment and treatment of the evidence set out below,1 
this Part of the Report will summarise, with little weighing or assessment, the complaints 
voiced during Module One of the Inquiry of an unethical press. As cannot be over-emphasised, 
the criticisms are not of every title or every journalist, or even anything like every title or 
every  journalist.  The  great  majority  of  both  perform  their  work  admirably,  ethically  and 
with  scrupulous  attention  to  detail.  The  purpose  of  the  Inquiry,  however,  was  to  address 
the practices of those who do not and any culture that is based on the latter rather than the 
former. Accordingly, references to unethical or unlawful practices of “the press” must be read 
as referring to such practices within “parts of the press”. It should be noted, however, that 
although some stories in the regional press have been the subject of criticism, the generic 
concerns are not directed to the regional press.

1.3 

The initial wave of evidence received by the Inquiry from its first 21 witnesses, over five working 
days between 21 November and 28 November 2011, undoubtedly made an immediate and 
powerful impact within the Inquiry room and beyond. All those who spoke volunteered to do 
so; more have complained and some of the further statements have been put into the record 
of the Inquiry. Access to this evidence by the vast majority of the public has been through 
the Inquiry’s website which remains available to anyone who wishes to view or review this 
testimony:  everyone  therefore  has  the  opportunity  to  test  the  Inquiry’s  assessments  and 
conclusions against this evidence base if so minded. 

This Chapter summarises the thematic trends which emerged in the evidence given by the 
victims of unethical press practices in the first 5 days of the inquiry. But before beginning to 
examine these trends, it is possible to take a wider perspective. Complaints of an unethical 
press are of considerable lineage and are not confined to the United Kingdom. Of perhaps 
even greater relevance for present purposes is not so much the bare fact that such complaints 
have been made but rather the contemporary chord they often strike. For example, the great 
American jurists, Warren and Brandeis, writing in the Harvard Law Review in 1890 said this:

“The  press  is  overstepping  in  every  direction  the  obvious  bounds  of  propriety  and 
decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become 
a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery. To satisfy a prurient 
taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily 
papers. To occupy the indolent, column upon column is filled with idle gossip, which 
can only be procured by intrusion upon the domestic circle...”

1.4 

The  reference  to  the  need  to  satisfy  a  prurient  taste  hints  at  the  commercial  pressures 
operating on the press as long ago as 1890. More recently, Sir John Major writing at the very 
end of the twentieth century put the point somewhat differently:2

“Across  Fleet  Street,  sensational  and  exclusive  stories  sold  extra  copies  –  straight 
reporting  did  not.  Accuracy  suffered,  squandered  for  something,  anything,  ‘new’. 
Quotes  were  reconstructed,  leaks  and  splashes  abounded,  confidentiality  was  not 
respected and reputations sacrificed for a few days’ hysterical splash.”

At  a  perhaps  higher  level  of  generality,  in  mitigating  his  client’s  case  on  his  behalf  at  the 
sentencing hearing which took place on 26 January 2007, defence counsel for Clive Goodman 
said this:3

“Mr Goodman has lived his life in a world where, and I say this with some trepidation, 
ethical lines are not always clearly defined, or at least observed...”

1.6 

Defence  counsel  was  no  doubt  speaking  on  instructions  when  he  made  this  submission. 
Regardless  of  the  trepidation  apparently  evinced,  the  point  counsel  was  making  was  not 
intended to be revelatory; rather, he was seeking to remind the judge that his  client was 
operating within a wider press culture which did not always encourage best practice. It is 
unlikely that ‘the world’ he was referring to was confined to the microcosm of the News of 
the World (NoTW): it was intended as a wider metaphor comprising the press as a whole, or 
at the very least a section of it. 

1.7 

In his closing arguments on behalf of Northern & Shell, James Dingemans QC submitted, in 
the context of his succinct analysis of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, that:4

“... [f]ourthly, the evidence shows that they have a tendency to see news as divorced 
from the individuals involved. Fifthly, in some areas, there has been shown a stunning 
lack of judgment to the extent that it might engage the criminal law, and I say no more 
about that; about where lines can properly be drawn between the public interest in 
acquiring news and privacy”

f

1.8 

In  his  closing  remarks,  Rhodri  Davies  QC  on  behalf  of  News  International  arguably  went 
slightly further:5

“Going on to the evidence heard in Module 1, there is no doubt that that made out 
the case that all has not been well with the press...”

1.9 

Finally, when asked for his assessment of the evidence the Inquiry received during Module 
One,  Rt  Hon  Michael  Gove  MP,  Secretary  of  State  for  Education  recognised  that  the 
evidence disclosed a problem which was capable of being regarded as ‘serious’,6 although he 
proceeded to observe that the cure might be worse than the disease. This, of course, raises a 
separate matter which will be relevant when discussing what ‘the cure’ might be. For present 
purposes it is sufficient to record that a wide range of witnesses, commentators, observers 
and interested parties have stated or opined that not all is well in the state of the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press: the complaints cannot be dismissed, as parts of the press 
have sought to do, as the whining of a few disgruntled celebrities. 

1.10  The ground having being set, a thumb-nail sketch of the complaints of unacceptable press 
practice will now be set out under thematic sub-headings, recognising always a considerable 
element of overlap between many of these.

2.1

2.4 

Failing to respect individual privacy and dignity
An overarching complaint which encompasses many of the individual cases set out below 
is that the press has failed always to treat individuals with common decency, and has failed 
always  to  respect  individual  privacy.  This  encompasses  many  of  the  unethical  techniques 
complained  of,  including  phone  hacking,  surveillance,  blagging  and  harassment.  It  is  also 
exemplified  by  complaints  relating  to  the  publication  of  private  and/or  sensitive  material 
without any public interest justification, and the intrusion into grief or shock. Three of the 
‘case studies’ examined below7 are prime examples of this tendency: the way in which parts 
of the press treated the Dowlers, the McCanns, and Christopher Jefferies indicates a press 
indifferent to individual privacy and casual in its approach to truth, even when the stories 
were potentially extremely damaging for the individuals involved. 

Further evidence relevant to this complaint included Sienna Miller’s complaints of harassment, 
and  the  intrusion  into  the  private  grief  of  Anne  Diamond  and  Baroness  Hollins.  Further 
evidence suggesting that parts of the press have failed to respect individual dignity and privacy 
were the examples seen by the Inquiry of the access and publication of sensitive personal 
information, including medical information, without any or any adequate consideration of 
the rights of, and effects on, the person in question and his or her family. Examples included 
the publication of confidential medical information relating to one of Gordon Brown MP’s 
children in 2006, and the publication of extracts of the Kate McCann diaries in the NoTW in 
2008: these are both the subject of detailed analysis below.

The key issues to be considered under this heading are whether practices existed within the 
press consistent with an unethical culture of seeing individuals (and celebrities in particular) 
as  objects,  that  is  to  say,  simply  as  material  for  a  story;  whether  there  was  an  unethical 
cultural indifference to the consequences of exposing private lives; and, whether there was 
an unethical cultural indifference to the public interest in exposing private lives, exemplified 
by failures to put in place adequate procedures to ensure that potentially relevant public 
interest considerations were addressed and recorded.

Unlawful or unethical acquisition of private information

Phone hacking

A number of witnesses have alleged that they were the victims of phone hacking, in all but 
one case at the hands of a private investigator engaged, and perhaps journalists employed, 
by the NoTW.8 Much of the supporting evidence is derived from the notebooks of the private 
investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, currently the subject of detailed review by the officers involved 
in Operation Weeting. Additionally, reliance may safely be placed for present purposes on the 
admissions and settlements made by News Group Newspapers in the civil proceedings and the 
acknowledgements that such actions were unacceptable and wrong made by representatives 
of that company, News International, and News Corporation before the Culture, Media and 
Sport Select Committee and the Inquiry itself.

2.7 

Notwithstanding the number of arrests which have been made to date,9 it is still not clear 
just how widespread the practice of phone hacking was, or the extent to which it may have 
extended beyond one title; and, in the light of the limitations which necessarily impact on 
this aspect of the Inquiry because of the ongoing investigation and impending prosecutions, 
it is simply not possible to be definitive. The evidence of Paul McMullan, Sharon Marshall and 
James Hipwell points to phone hacking being a common and known practice at the NoTW 
and elsewhere. In relation to other titles, the degree of knowledge, acquiescence and turning 
of the metaphorical blind eye may be difficult to assess quantitatively on the basis of the 
evidence the Inquiry has received (although a fuller analysis of this issue will be conducted 
below);10 in qualitative terms, however, valuable evidence was obtained from witnesses such 
as Piers Morgan, Heather Mills, Jeremy Paxman and Dominic Mohan.

Although  the  Regulation  of  Investigatory  Powers  Act  2000  (RIPA)  contains  no  defence  of 
acting in the public interest, the Inquiry has examined the extent to which it could be argued 
that the hacking of voicemails was carried out in pursuit of stories which could properly and 
fairly be characterised as being in the public interest. There is no evidence that this is so: to 
such extent as the evidence has been ventilated, the hacking of voicemails was systematically 
deployed to garner pieces of gossip and tittle-tattle about the lives of celebrities and those 
otherwise in the public eye whether as victims of crime, politicians or potential sources for 
stories;  in  other  words,  to  intrude  into  their  privacy  without  any  conceivable  justification 
that could truly be argued to be in the public interest. Whereas in other contexts it has been 
argued by the press, or sections of the press, that there is a public interest in freedom of 
speech itself, and that an editor should be permitted to decide where the ethical balance 
falls, no such argument has been aired in this particular context.

Put at its very lowest, the Inquiry will need to consider whether, at least until 2006, there 
existed a culture within the press of indifference to the unlawfulness of the practice of phone 
hacking (or a lack of understanding of its unlawfulness, which itself is difficult to justify) and 
to its unethical nature. It will also be necessary to consider whether the evidence received is 
sufficient to reach conclusions in respect of the use of phone hacking at titles other than the 
NoTW.

Blagging

2.8 

Aside from the evidence generated by Operation Motorman,11 a number of witnesses told 
the Inquiry how their privacy had been breached in contravention of the Editors’ Code and 
also potentially section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998, through the technique known 
as blagging. A flavour of this evidence may be given by furnishing a number of examples. In 
her witness statement12 JK Rowling stated that, during the course of 1998, she received a 
telephone call purportedly from the Post Office. The caller explained that they had a package 
that the Post Office wanted to deliver but that they did not have Ms Rowling’s address. On 
the face of it, this was a remarkable claim and, on being pressed to justify it by Ms Rowling, 
the  caller  swiftly  hung  up.  It  is  difficult  to  avoid  the  inference  that  this  was  a  journalist 
seeking personal information. Ms Rowling’s husband-to-be appears to have received similar 
treatment by the press in 2000.13 He was telephoned by a person claiming to be from the tax 
office seeking information regarding his address and earnings, and this was duly disclosed.

474

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicThe following day this information was published by a Scottish newspaper and the paparazzi 
duly descended on Ms Rowling’s future husband’s home. The inference that the caller was a 
journalist is here even stronger.

2.9 

HJK14 gave a similar account of being the likely victim of this technique.15 Again, there was a 
telephone call from someone claiming to be from the Royal Mail, but, on this occasion, the 
assertion was made that the address on a package had been ripped off and all that was left 
was the intended recipient’s mobile phone number. HJK provided his/her address and later 
that month received an unwelcome visit from a journalist determined to find out whether 
he/she was in a relationship with X. The journalist was adamant as to the reliability of his 
sources,  and  subsequently  proposed  that  HJK  should  come  to  ‘an  arrangement’  with  him 
regarding the disclosure of information. HJK refused to do so.

2.10  Overall, and in a similar manner to phone hacking, the Inquiry will need to consider whether 
there was a culture of indifference within the press as to the lawfulness of blagging (or a lack 
of understanding as to its unlawfulness), and to its unethical nature.

Email hacking

2.11  The present state of affairs in relation to Operation Tuleta is set out elsewhere.16 Given its 
current status it is difficult to reach any conclusions of a generic nature in relation to email 
hacking, save to observe that it remains possible that a considerable quantity of criminality 
will be exposed in due course.

Bribery and corruption

2.12  Again, the present state of affairs in relation to Operation Elveden is set out elsewhere.17 As 
of 31 October 2012 (Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers’ fourth witness statement) a 
total of 52 individuals had been arrested by officers working on Operation Elveden; of these, 
27 were current and former journalists (including journalists from The Sun; the Daily Mirror 
and its sister paper, the Sunday Mirror; and the Daily Star Sunday).18 In an important piece of 
evidence, DAC Akers pointed out that offences of this nature were suspected to have been 
committed in at least three separate newspaper groups right up to early 2012.19 

2.13  The  fact  that  these  arrests  have  occurred  does  not  of  course  prove  that  an  unlawful  and 
unethical practice existed within the press of inducing, or seeking to induce, public officials to 
disclose confidential information about individuals or organisations; given the test required 
to justify arrest in the first place, it merely raises reasonable grounds to suspect that various 
offences  may  have  been  committed.  Further,  the  ongoing  criminal  investigation  hampers 
the ability of the Inquiry to explore the available evidence. Recognising these constraining 
factors, these developments cannot be dismissed as irrelevant.

and until a criminal court determines otherwise

475

Chapter 3 | Complaints of an Unethical PressFSurveillance, subterfuge and similar intrusive methods

2.14  A number of witnesses, as well as those contributing submissions on the Inquiry website, 
have described the use of covert surveillance or intrusive subterfuge by journalists or their 
independent contractors as a means of uncovering stories. This testimony covers a range of 
different techniques: by way of example, the deployment of private detectives to carry out 
what might be described as traditional surveillance of subjects; the recording of telephone 
conversations with subjects, sometimes coupled with the giving of assurances which are not 
kept; and the use of long-lens photography. At the very least, the issue arises of whether 
journalists  give  any,  or  any  adequate,  consideration  to  such  surveillance  being  likely  to 
generate relevant information in the public interest.

2.15  The evidence of journalists Sharon Marshall and Paul McMullan, which appeared to confirm 
the widespread use of such techniques by parts of the press, must be treated with a degree 
of caution. But it must also be considered in light of other evidence heard by the Inquiry. That 
evidence included the logbooks of private investigators Derek Webb20 and Matt Sprake21 which 
showed newspaper titles having commissioned covert and sometimes extended surveillance 
on hundreds of individuals, most of them so called celebrities, over a number of years. Mr 
Sprake’s evidence that ethical questions were for the newspapers which commissioned his 
work rather than for him emphasised the importance of newspaper oversight of third parties. 

f

2.16  Evidence  from  ‘targets’  of  intrusive  press  techniques  also  supported  the  evidence  of  Ms 
Marshall  and  Mr  McMullan.  The  inquiry  heard  of  the  gross  intrusions  into  the  privacy  of 
lawyers Charlotte Harris and Mark Lewis by News International. It also heard of the paranoia 
caused by the surveillance on, and/or threats received by, politicians Tom Watson MP and 
Chris Bryant MP. Other witnesses, including Steve Coogan, gave evidence of the use by the 
press of duplicity and subterfuge to acquire stories that could not possibly be justified by the 
public interest.

2.17  The Report will need to consider the extent to which these practices and others were sporadic 

and limited or widespread and/or cultural within parts of the press.

Unlawful or unethical treatment of individuals
Harassment

2.18  A  number  of  witnesses  testified  to  a  range  of  practices,  including  the  use  of  intrusive 
photography, pursuit by photographers whether on foot or in vehicles, ‘door-stepping’ and 
‘staking out’. Here again the Inquiry will need to consider whether a culture existed within the 
press, or a section of the press, which encouraged or condoned these practices; or, insofar 
as these practices were perpetrated by independent contractors, which failed to ensure that 
sufficient steps were taken to ascertain whether information, photographs and data were 
acquired in a context in which an individual was subject to harassment.

2.19  Amongst  the  most  cogent  evidence  of  harassment  of  this  nature  was  that  given  by  the 
actress Sienna Miller. She gave a powerful account of acts of dangerous driving, and of being 
harassed, verbally abused and spat at by freelance photographers, until, that is, a court order 
protected her from such conduct in the future:22

476

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public“I would often find myself – I was 21 – at midnight running down a dark street on my 
own with ten big men chasing me and the fact that they had cameras in their hands 
meant that that was legal, but if you take away the cameras, what have you got? 
You’ve got a pack of men chasing a woman and obviously that’s a very intimidating 
situation to be in.”

2.20  Ms Marshall in Tabloid Girl has written about the efforts that both she and her colleagues went 
to secure a story; common practices included the aggressive door-stepping of individuals. In 
one notable instance she described her efforts to door-step the broadcast journalist, Jeremy 
Paxman, by putting the same question to him 14 times,23 in an attempt to report on rumours 
of an extramarital affair.24 She described other occasions in which, whilst in pursuit of a story, 
she harried individuals at their home and refused to comply with requests to desist in her 
attempts to obtain a quote or break a story.25 

2.21  Ms Marshall’s memoirs (which she sought to dilute in her evidence by talking about the use 
of ‘top-spin’) record a pattern of behaviour which is also described by a number of witnesses. 
Ms Miller, Sheryl Gascoigne and the McCanns gave consistent evidence of high-speed car 
chases  by  journalists  and  press  photographers.  Ms  Gascoigne  explained  how,  following 
her marriage to the footballer Paul Gascoigne, she was subjected to intense press scrutiny 
that sought to depict her as a money grabber and the cause of her husband’s issues with 
addiction and mental illness. This scrutiny went beyond coverage of her public appearances 
and extended to the sustained harassment of her in and around her home. At times it took 
extraordinary forms. One journalist followed Ms Gascoigne and her children from their home 
in Hertfordshire to the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent.26 

2.22 

2.23 

In very different contexts, Christopher Jefferies and Kate and Gerry McCann described their 
experiences of sustained scrutiny and intrusion following the well-publicised events which 
attracted press interest. All three witnesses described how journalists and press photographers 
camped outside their homes, sometimes for days on end, making it impossible for them to go 
about their daily lives or indeed live comfortably or securely in the family home.27

In his witness statement Dr McCann told the Inquiry how at times his car was mobbed by 
journalists and photographers as he, or his wife, tried to drive with their family from their 
home. He recalled that journalists and press photographers banged on the car windows and 
shouted at the family even though their young children were not only visible but were also 
clearly distressed by such behaviour.28 

Intrusion into grief or shock

2.24  A number of witnesses told the Inquiry of occasions when journalists and press photographers 
intruded into moments of grief, shock and similar personal difficulty, in the face of clause 5 
of the Editors’ Code and the wish of the witnesses to be left in peace. For example, Anne 
Diamond, the broadcast journalist and presenter, described how following the loss of her infant

Chapter 3 | Complaints of an Unethical PressFson through cot death, she wrote to all the editors of the national newspapers asking them 
to stay away from the funeral. However, she told the Inquiry that she saw a photographer in 
the vicinity of the church, and that a photograph of her and her husband was then published 
on the front page of The Sun above a bogus story entitled ‘Anne’s plea’. The editor of The 
Sun rejected Ms Diamond’s husband’s request not to publish the photograph29 and, following 
what she described as ‘emotional blackmail’, the family subsequently succumbed to pressure 
placed on them by the paper to join forces with The Sun to raise funds in aid of cot death 
research, rival papers carrying ‘spoiler stories’ shortly thereafter.30 Thus, what should have 
been an intensely private moment of personal anguish was rendered all the more difficult 
and distressing.

2.25  Ms Diamond’s evidence on this topic related to events which occurred nearly 20 years ago, 
but not dissimilar evidence was given by Professor Baroness Sheila Hollins whose daughter 
Abigail  was  the  victim  of  a  brutal  knife  attack  in  April  2005.  She  told  the  Inquiry  how  a 
journalist tricked her way into the home of Baroness Hollins’ terminally ill mother and refused 
to leave until she was given a photograph of Abigail; eventually the police had to be called to 
secure her departure.31 Similar acts of press intrusion and insensitivity included attempts to 
photograph Abigail at her grandmother’s funeral,32 the taking and publishing of photographs 
of the whole family during a trip to Lourdes,33 and surveillance of the entrance to Abigail’s 
home for a number of weeks. When one of the journalists in question was approached, he is 
alleged to have said that he was doing nothing wrong.34

f

Discrimination and the treatment of women and minorities

2.26  The  evidence  bearing  on  this  topic  is  addressed  in  Section  3  below  when  discussing  the 
nature of the harm caused to public discourse by unacceptable press practices. The issue 
for consideration below35 is whether an unethical culture, and concomitant practices, have 
existed within the press in relation to the discrimination and the treatment of women and 
minorities,  in  particular  by  demonstrating  and  fostering  prejudice,  unfairness  and  lack  of 
respect  and  dignity,  and  failing  to  avoid  prejudicial  or  pejorative  reference  to  individuals’ 
race, colour, religion, transgender, gender, sexual orientation or disability.

Inaccuracy and inaccessibility

2.27  Many witnesses have complained of stories about them being inaccurate or misleading (see, 
for the most egregious examples, the evidence of Christopher Jefferies and the McCanns); 
some have gone further to allege that evidence and quotations are deliberately fabricated 
in order to substantiate a story, add colour to it, or to pursue a particular line. Furthermore, 
organisations  such  as  Full  Fact  have  drawn  to  the  Inquiry’s  attention  many  examples  of 
allegedly knowingly inaccurate or misleading reporting in areas such as asylum, immigration 
and climate change.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.28  The point has already been made above36 that it is in the nature of journalism that mistakes 
will  be  made:  indeed,  that  is  an  unavoidable  aspect  of  human  nature  itself.  Deliberate 
falsification  (or  reckless  reporting)  of  material  and  evidence  is,  of  course,  another  matter 
altogether. The Inquiry will need to determine whether culture and practices exist within the 
press which fall short of the standards of accuracy which can reasonably be expected to be in 
the public interest. As part and parcel of this overall assessment, consideration will need to 
be given to whether, in particular, insufficient standards of care have been applied to avoiding 
the publication of inaccurate, misleading or distorted information, including pictures; and of 
whether misleading or inaccurate headlines have been deployed, knowingly or otherwise, 
with a view to attracting purchases.

2.29 

Justice  cannot  be  done  to  all  the  multifarious  complaints  of  inaccuracy  which  the  Inquiry 
received. Instead, for present purposes the focus will be on the evidence of a number of 
journalists.  Both  Richard  Peppiatt  and  Sharon  Marshall  pointed  to  a  propensity  in  some 
parts of the press towards a form of lazy journalism where quotes were made up to back a 
particular line in a story,37 or where entire stories were built around fabricated quotations.38 
Both were also clear that in the newsrooms in which they worked this practice was neither 
limited to a small number of journalists nor deprecated. Rather, the practice was widespread, 
managers were aware of it and even offered cash incentives to staff.39 It should be noted 
that this evidence has been strenuously denied by the papers concerned and that its quality 
wholly depends on the assessment the Inquiry makes as to their credibility and reliability as 
witnesses.

2.30  Similar evidence was provided to the Inquiry by Chris Atkins, the director of Starsuckers, a 
documentary on the willingness of tabloid newspapers to run stories supplied by third parties 
with little or no basis in truth. Mr Atkins described supplying one newspaper with a fabricated 
story about a particular celebrity’s hair catching on fire at a party. In addition to running the 
story without making due efforts to check its authenticity, the paper further embellished the 
story by inventing a pithy conclusion: the paper wrote that another person at the party had 
put the fire out by punching the woman in her ‘barnet’.40 

2.31  Evidence of falsification and inaccuracy presented to the Inquiry goes beyond the fabrication 
of single or even small numbers of facts associated with a story or with a witness. Hugh Grant 
gave evidence about the publication in the Sunday Express of an entire article supposedly 
written by him; in fact, he had had nothing to do with it.41 

2.32 

In a revealing exchange with Robert Jay QC, Dawn Neesom, the editor of the Daily Star, said 
this:42

Q.  There might be a kernel of truth in the story, but in order to make it more appetising 
and entertaining to its readers, which obviously you are plugged into –
A.  Yes, of course.

Chapter 3 | Complaints of an Unethical PressFf

Q.  you spin, embroider and weave around the edges of the story. Does that happen?
A.  It’s – I wouldn’t quite put it in those words, but as I say, it’s written in a style that 
we know works for our readers.

2.33  On a separate but related topic, a considerable number of witnesses and commentators have 
complained about the use of misleading and inaccurate headlines, often it seems knowingly 
used in order to attract custom. By way of example only, a number of such instances were put 
to Ms Neesom,43 and at least in one case she deployed the somewhat euphemistic adjectives 
‘dramatic’ and ‘eye-catching’ to characterise the inaccurate headline used. She also accepted 
in this context, and perhaps in others, that newspapers do on occasion ‘cross lines’.44 

2.34  As with all these complaints of unethical conduct, an assessment will need to be made below45 
as to whether this particular problem is sporadic on the one hand or illustrative of a cultural 
strand within press practice on the other.

2.35  Aside from these complaints of inaccuracy, the Inquiry has also received a body of evidence 
which, on analysis, may be characterised as amounting to a generic complaint of it being 
difficult, if not impossible, for readers to assess for themselves the evidential basis for what 
is apparently being put forward as fact. This evidence may be categorised as follows: that 
there has been an insufficiently clear distinction between comment, conjecture and fact, as 
required by clause 1 of the Editors’ Code; that insufficient information has been provided 
in relation to the sources of material published, on occasion giving rise to the suspicion if 
not the inference that the source did not exist; and, that insufficient care has been taken 
in relation to the special public interest in the understanding of material relating to public 
health, medical and other scientific matters. 

2.36 

It is fully understood that each of these three categories gives rise to its own set of problems. 
Newspapers are, of course, entitled to speculate and to offer their own opinions, and the 
definition  of  what  is  ‘fact’  is  capable  of  being  controversial,  depending  on  the  context. 
Furthermore,  as  a  number  of  Core  Participants  have  pointed  out,  with  reference  to  legal 
authority,  the  distinction  between  fact  and  opinion  in  the  specific  context  of  the  law  of 
defamation is itself one of judgment: each does not require a separate, self-contained article 
or section of the newspaper, provided that it is reasonably clear to the reader from the tone 
and language used which is which. However, the complaint that has frequently been made 
is that, even with this element of latitude, fact and opinion are often so co-mingled that the 
reader is misled. Clause 1 of the Editors’ Code correctly recognises the importance of this 
distinction, particularly in circumstances where the reader is placing trust in the newspaper 
as a reliable purveyor of news as fact. Many have complained that clause 1 is more honoured 
in the breach than in the observance, and the validity and strength of this complaint will 
therefore need to be assessed.

2.37  The issue of journalistic sources is more controversial, not least because clause 10 of the 
Editors’ Code places a moral obligation on journalists to protect their confidential sources. 
If this obligation were to be interpreted as being absolute, in the sense of being incapable 
of yielding to countervailing public interest considerations, then clause 10 itself would be 
exceptionable as going further than the protections accorded to journalists under Article 10 
of the ECHR and the law of contempt. In any event, there is a wider concern here, namely that 
journalists may not always act ethically when invoking what protections they should properly 
enjoy. The evidence heard from Richard Peppiatt, Alastair Campbell, Hugh Grant and Magnus

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicBoyd raised the strong suspicion, even if it did not provide conclusive evidence, that some 
journalists habitually refer to ‘sources’ even where the latter do not exist or where they have 
never said that which is attributed to them. But readers will never know where the truth lies, 
and will never acquire the means of finding out, because abuses of the system are extremely 
difficult to prove. The anonymous source (and one who truly requires anonymity as the price 
for giving up the story) can of course be an extremely valuable tool in the hands of the ethical 
and scrupulous journalist, but the possibilities for abuse are legion. An assessment will need 
to be made as to the extent to which the important principle of the anonymous source is 
abused, even if there is no obvious solution to that abuse. 

2.38  The third category of complaint under this rubric is one articulated by a number of special 
interest groups in relation to scientific, medical and public health reporting: not simply is the 
concern one of inaccuracy, it also covers a failure to provide sufficient information to facilitate 
public understanding of what can often be complex and multi-faceted issues, where there may 
be no ‘right’ answer. The complaint has been variously expressed: as one of imbalance; or one 
of unreliability; and, in clear-cut instances, as one of frank inaccuracy. Again, it is appreciated 
that  complex  issues  have  to  be  set  out  in  a  manner  comprehensible  to  readers,  and  that 
newspapers  often  succeed  in  distilling  and  presenting  these  in  an  admirably  user-friendly 
fashion.  The  issue  which  arises,  though,  is  whether  there  exists  a  strand  of  unacceptable 
practice within the press which needs to be recognised and addressed.

Treatment of critics and complainants
General discouragement of public criticism

2.39  Numerous  individuals  in  public  life  have  complained  in  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  that  they 
have been afraid or unwilling to confront the power of the press, or – putting the matter 
another way, failings in the culture, practices and ethics of the press – owing to concerns 
about personal attack and vilification. The issue for consideration is not whether these fears 
are  honestly  held  (given  the  weight  of  convergent  evidence,  this  could  not  seriously  be 
disputed) but rather whether the press has by its conduct caused, fostered or permitted such 
an ‘atmosphere’ to exist and be perpetuated whereby such fears have naturally spread.

2.40  The  corpus  of  evidence  relevant  to  this  issue  is  vast,  but  for  present  purposes  it  can  be 
considered in three parts. First, the Inquiry heard evidence of overt intimidation of those 
who had criticised the press. For example, after writing critical articles about the Daily Star in 
particular, and the tabloid press in general, Richard Peppiatt received threatening phone calls 
and text messages saying that he was “a marked man until the day you die”. Similarly, while 
Hugh Grant was criticising tabloid press ethics while appearing on Question Time, the mother 
of his child was called and told to “Tell Hugh Grant to shut the fuck up”. 

2.41  Second, a significant number of the witnesses who testified during the first two weeks of 
Module One gave evidence of their fears of, or actual retaliation, by the press in response to 
complaints. JK Rowling made the point very compellingly in these terms:46

“I would like to emphasise that what I’m about to say does not apply to the whole of 
the British press, but it is my experience with certain sectors of the British press. If you 
lock horns with them in this way, if you protest or you make a complaint, then you can 
expect some form of retribution fairly quickly, and I thought the fact that in this case 
a picture of my child was put into the papers, so very quickly after I’d asked them not 
to print my address, I thought that was spiteful, actually. Just spiteful.”

481

Chapter 3 | Complaints of an Unethical PressFf

2.42  Her experience was consistent with a body of evidence received by the Inquiry suggesting that 
a practice has existed within the press of obtaining or publishing material about individuals or 
organisations with whom they have been in dispute or disagreement, in circumstances where 
it is legitimate to conclude that the aim was to ‘pay back’ or ‘punish’ for the disagreement by 
causing distress, embarrassment or discomfort, rather than because the article had a public 
interest for the readership.

2.43  Two possible examples of this practice may be provided at this stage although each will be 
discussed in greater detail below.47 The first concerns what may be described as ‘real-time’ 
evidence generated by or during the course of the Inquiry: the Daily Mail accused Hugh Grant 
of ‘a mendacious smear’ after he had given evidence to the Inquiry when he speculated that 
his voicemail had been hacked by or on the instructions of Daily Mail journalists.48 Second, 
a very similar sort of allegation was made by The Sun against Gordon Brown MP in relation 
to  his  claims  of  how  the  paper  had  obtained  details  of  his  son’s  medical  condition.49  The 
terminology used by the paper was that Mr Brown’s allegation had been ‘false and a smear’.50 
The very obvious parallels between the two stories are notable, and an assessment is made 
below51 of the extent to which the press response in those examples was fair and/or to what 
extent it reflected a wider culture of aggressive defence.

2.44  Third, examples were provided of aggressive press attacks on decision makers who brought 
proposals, or made decisions, perceived to be adverse to parts of the press. Vitriolic attacks 
by The Sun on female critics of Page 3 were prime examples. A further example was the press 
response (and not just the NoTW) to Max Mosley’s victory in his privacy action before Mr 
Justice Eady, which often appeared high in critical volume but low on reasoned and measured 
analysis.  Some  editors  resorted  to  ad  hominem  attack,  characterising  the  judge  as  being 
‘arrogant’ and ‘immoral’.52 Adverse comment about judges, and in relation to judicial decisions, 
can be entirely legitimate and represent the proper exercise of the right to challenge: I am 
not, for one moment, seeking to suggest otherwise. In this case, however, as was pointed 
out in the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee Report on Press Standards, Privacy 
and Libel,53 the criticism of the ruling was too often based on a frank misunderstanding of 
the judicial role in applying the well-established principles set out in Article 8 of the ECHR 
as explained by the Strasbourg court. In any event, it is worth pointing out that if, Mr Justice 
Eady had erred in this regard, it was open to News International to appeal his decision to the 
Court of Appeal: it did not do so. Had there been good grounds of appeal, it is implausible 
that News International would not have sought to exercise its rights.

2.45  The point goes further: quite apart from the extent to which titles do, in fact, write critically 
about those who have challenged them (all in the name of the exercise of free speech), the 
climate is such that that there is an undeniable perception that this is precisely what will

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publichappen. Witnesses were reluctant to give evidence because of the fear of press retribution; 
some overcame that expression of fear but others did not. I do not make any finding or reach 
any conclusion based upon what is not part of the evidence but the same inference may be 
drawn from the unwillingness of journalists to speak out (which resulted in the necessity to 
hear evidence anonymously through the National Union of Journalists). The fear of journalists 
was not merely that the relevant title would not employ them: it was that a consequence of 
speaking out would be that they would no longer be able to obtain any employment in the 
national press. This feature alone raises real concerns about the culture and practices of the 
press, in closing ranks and refusing to accept and recognise that legitimate debate about its 
own role and methods of working is not to be shut down but encouraged.

Failure to take reasonable steps to pre-notify

2.46  Article 8 of the ECHR does not place an obligation on newspapers to pre-notify the subjects 
of  intended  stories  as  a  matter  of  course54  and  it  is  easily  understood  why  some  stories 
cannot be the subject of pre-notification. However, concerns have been expressed during 
the course of the Inquiry that, in some of those cases where pre-notification did not occur, 
culture and practices have existed within a section of the press of deliberate decisions not to 
take reasonable steps to pre-notify the subjects of news articles in advance, without there 
being a good reason not to do so. The principal aim of this was to unfairly deny the subject of 
the article the possibility of verifying or challenging it, or to ensure that the story is not lost 
to a competitor. A number of journalists and editors testified to a reluctance to pre-notify in 
certain situations; the evidence relating to Max Mosley’s privacy action and the publication 
of the Kate McCann diaries provides a powerful insight into the key drivers of press conduct 
in this type of situation. Each of these cases is considered as an individual example below,55 
but the absence of pre-notification is not examined as a problem to be addressed generally. 
All the evidence suggested that a failure to pre-notify was the very rare exception rather than 
a recurring practice or culture within the press.

Failures to take reasonable steps to remedy

2.47  Numerous  witnesses  gave  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  of  the  difficulties  they  have  faced  in 
seeking an opportunity to reply to inaccuracies in stories (notwithstanding clause 2 of the 
Editors’ Code) and in securing corrections or apologies, either at all or published with suitable 
prominence. Given the weight of evidence bearing on this issue (which is considered in detail 
below),56  it  may  well  be  difficult  for  anyone  to  deny  the  existence  of  a  problem;57  it  will, 
however, be necessary to examine whether its manifestation may fairly be characterised as 
illustrative of a cultural failing in the press or a section of the press.

3.  the harm
3.1 

Overall, it is possible to group these complaints of unethical practices by the press under two 
general headings. First, there are a series of complaints which, however formulated, amount 
in  essence  to  an  allegation  that  the  press  have  failed  to  respect  the  rights  and  personal 
autonomy of individuals in circumstances where there is no, or no sufficient, public interest 
justification for that failure. Second, there are complaints of inaccuracy in press reporting, 
either in relation to what individuals have or have not done, or in relation to what might be 
described as matters of general public interest.

Chapter 3 | Complaints of an Unethical PressF3.2 

All the ramifications of unethical conduct by the press need fully to be understood. Some of 
these may be obvious: defamatory reporting in relation to individuals is capable of destroying 
reputations although an action in libel goes some way to restore the position. Breaches of 
privacy may also do the same, and the fact that a story happens to be true (although it should 
never have been published) may lead to damage which cannot be repaired. This consequence 
is  not  inevitable  because  a  breach  of  privacy  which  does  not  result  in  publication  of  any 
story may have only very limited (if any) adverse consequences: the private information may 
only be shared between a handful of journalists who themselves decide to keep it private. 
However, this prospect aside, some of the consequences of unethical conduct by the press are 
less obvious and therefore require exposition. Furthermore, consideration needs to be given 
to the broader, and perhaps deeper, consequences for a mature democracy respectful of the 
rights and freedoms of individuals of inaccurate and unjustifiably intrusive press reporting. 
This section of the Report will begin to examine these issues.

Consequences of intrusive reporting

Phone hacking

3.3  While phone hacking itself is a ‘silent crime’ inasmuch as the victim will usually be unaware 
of, or not even suspect, the covert assault on his or her privacy, its consequences – both 
direct and indirect – have often been serious and wide-ranging, as the evidence submitted 
to the Inquiry and separately generated by the phone hacking litigation has demonstrated. 

f

3.4 

The Inquiry has heard how the details of private lives, known only to the witnesses testifying 
(in  other  words,  the  targets  of  voicemail  hacking)  and  their  most  trusted  confidants  and 
friends,  became  the  subject  of  articles  in  the  press.58  Further,  evidence  was  also  received 
that, as a consequence of voicemail hacking, journalists and press photographers were able to 
record moments that were intensely private, such as relationship breakdown,59 or family grief, 
without either the knowledge or input of the individuals concerned. Sienna Miller explained 
how she was the subject of many articles either speculating on or reporting the state of her 
relationship with the actor Jude Law. In many cases, the information that had formed the 
basis of these articles had been known only to Ms Miller, Mr Law and a very small number of 
confidants who had not shared the information further.60 Ms Miller gave a graphic description 
of the fall-out from the voicemail hacking which News International has, of course, admitted 
took place. This included the corrosive loss of trust in aspects of family life, in relationships 
and in friendships, Ms Miller assuming, understandably, that her inner circle was the source of 
stories in the press.61 She described herself as “torn between feeling completely paranoid that 
either someone close to [her] [a trusted family member or friend] was selling this information 
to the media or that someone was somehow hacking [her] telephone.” On one occasion she 
sat down with close family members and friends in one room and accused them of leaking 
stories to the press. Ms Miller explained that she felt that every area of her life was under 
constant surveillance; she felt violated, paranoid and anxious. 

3.5 

Other witnesses have told the Inquiry how they have lost friends and confidants as a consequence 
of the paranoia and mistrust engendered by phone-hacking. For example, Mary-Ellen Field 
described the damage done to her reputation and livelihood as the consequence of what she

articles about Ms MacPherson which set out in detail confidential information concerning her 
personal and private life, of which Ms Field had direct knowledge, Ms MacPherson assumed 
that Ms Field must have been the source of those stories. Ms Field’s refusal to acknowledge 
responsibility led to accusations of illness and then alcoholism for which she subsequently 
underwent treatment. Finally it was decided that Ms Field was incapable of carrying out her 
employment to the required standard and she was dismissed from her position. This led to 
financial difficulties and the loss of friendship.62 Ms Field has also made clear how difficult it 
has been to restore her reputation once such damage had been done.63

Other intrusive conduct

3.6 

The Inquiry has heard how the disclosure in the press of embarrassing or personal details 
not only impacts on the self-esteem and reputation of the person involved, but also affects 
others around them as well. For example, the spouses and children of witnesses have been 
subjected  to  bullying  and  abuse  as  a  consequence  of  stories  written  about  them.  Garry 
Flitcroft  described  the  abuse  directed  at  his  children  at  school  following  the  publication 
of stories in the press about him.64 He detailed how abuse by rival fans was so hurtful and 
offensive that his father could no longer watch him play football; he also believes that this 
ultimately contributed to his father’s suicide.65

3.7  Witnesses  have  also  spoken  about  the  distress  caused  to  spouses  and  partners  by  the 
aggressive pursuit of ‘kiss and tell’ stories and the knock-on effects of disclosures of infidelity. 
In a number of cases the disclosure of marital infidelity is believed to have led or contributed 
to a suicide attempt, or had a deleterious impact on the health of vulnerable members of the 
family. 

3.8 

3.9 

Charlotte Church said that her mother found articles published by the News of the World 
about her father’s infidelity, without forewarning, so distressing that it led to an attempt take 
her own life.66 The Inquiry has heard similar testimony from Max Mosley, who has expressed 
the belief that the constant, unflattering and unpleasant coverage of him was a contributing 
factor in the suicide of his son.67 

Consequences of inaccurate reporting
The  potential  damage  done  by  inaccurate  reporting  can  extend  well  beyond  the  intrinsic 
harm attendant on the distortion of fact. Witnesses have explained that it can cause much 
greater distress, anguish and pain. Taking perhaps the most extreme and unsettling example, 
Margaret Watson has set out her belief that inaccurate and partial reporting of the murder of 
her daughter, Diane, contributed significantly to the suicide of her son, Alan, who was unable 
to cope with the unsubstantiated allegations levelled at his dead sister.68 This evidence chimes 
with a number of submissions and witness statements received by the Inquiry from ordinary 

62 p7, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Witness-Statement-of-Mary-Ellen-Field2.pdf 
63 News International has sought summary judgment on Ms Field’s claim against it in the Chancery Division. It is 
believed that the basis of the application is not that Ms Field’s version of events is necessarily incorrect, but that there 
is no evidence that her voicemail, as opposed to that of Ms Macpherson, was hacked. This gives rise to a number of 
legal arguments not relevant for the purposes of the Inquiry

members  of  the  public  who  have  reported  their  experiences  of  inaccurate  reporting,  and 
subsequent refusal by the press to engage with attempts to correct those inaccuracies. In a 
number of cases, that coverage has concerned the suicide of a family member. 

3.10  Evidence of factual misreporting does not merely relate to suicide but also to the reporting 
on cases of murder. For example, the Director of Support After Murder and Manslaughter 
in Northern Ireland (SAMM NI), Pam Surphlis, described the routine inaccurate reporting by 
newspapers of murders committed in the Province. These inaccuracies related to the family 
details, age and background of the victims, and overall sensationalising of the murders, with 
damaging consequences for the families of the victims.69 In her oral evidence Mrs Surphlis 
referred to the newspaper coverage of the murder of a 15 year old boy in which the victim 
was described as a heroin addict, when in fact he was diabetic.70 She noted that “once it goes 
in, whether right or wrong, it becomes fact”.71 Mrs Surphlis also described the press coverage 
following the murder of her father and sister in 1993. Her father, who was a faith healer, was 
described as a ‘witchcraft clergyman’.72 Further, she gave the example of her sister, who in 
coverage of her death was always represented in a picture of her wedding dress even though 
she had endured years of marital abuse, notwithstanding that Mrs Surphlis had provided a 
different photograph.73 

3.11 

It goes without saying that reporting of this nature is particularly distressing to the family and 
friends of the deceased.

3.12  The  cases  of  the  McCanns  and  Christopher  Jefferies  are  especially  egregious  examples  of 
defamatory and sensationalised reporting causing, in their different ways, personal anguish 
and distress. These examples are treated in more detail below.74

Impact on public discourse

3.13  The Inquiry has received submissions and evidence from various campaign organisations or 
pressure groups, think tanks, community representative groups, professional practitioners, 
trade bodies and academic institutions complaining of the impact of inaccurate and at times 
discriminatory  and  inflammatory  reporting  on  public  discourse.  This  is  not  a  criticism  of 
the right of the press to be partial: it is a complaint specifically directed to inaccuracy. This 
problem is aggravated by the unwillingness of the PCC to accept complaints from interest 
groups unless there is an identified ‘victim’ of the reporting willing to complain. 

3.14  For  example,  evidence  was  received  from  ENGAGE,  an  organisation  set  up  to  promote 
improved awareness and standards of reporting in the British media of Muslims, as well as to 
encourage greater political participation and civic engagement of Muslims living in Britain.75 
ENGAGE provided examples of what it described as “inaccurate, unfair or discriminatory” 
reporting in some parts of the British press.76 In particular, ENGAGE expressed concern at 
what it suggested was a tendency to present reporting of fringe and extremist elements as

tended to reinforce that impression, but were without basis in fact, included “Poppies banned 
in terror hotspots” and “Muslim only public loos”. Reference was also made to a front page 
headline (“Muslim plot to kill the Pope”), published in the Daily Express in September 2010, 
which was later admitted to have no basis in fact.78 Although the paper published an apology 
and correction after a complaint had been made by ENGAGE, Mr Bungawala on behalf of that 
organisation pointed out that it was “a single sentence buried under a news item on page 
nine”.79 Tellingly, he explained that the size and placing of the correction does not mitigate 
the damage to community relations caused by a front page article of this nature.80 

3.15  Similar  concerns  at  the  damage  capable  of  being  caused  to  community  relations  and 
potentially vulnerable individuals have been raised by other organisations, in particular those 
representing migrant and refugee communities. Such organisations include The Runnymede 
Trust, the Refugee Council and the Migrant and Refugee Community Forum. 

3.16 

In  written  evidence  submitted  to  the  Inquiry,  both  the  Refugee  Council  and  Migrant  and 
Refugee Communities Forum suggest that some parts of the press seek deliberately (or, at 
least, recklessly) to conflate statistics for asylum and immigration to imply a growing “wave” 
of asylum seekers coming to the UK, despite evidence that the number of asylum seekers 
has fallen significantly since 2002.81  82 This view is also shared by the Joint Council for the 
Welfare of Immigrants, which contends that the motive may be a political one.83 The Migrant 
and Refugee Communities Forum draws attention to a report by the Cardiff University School 
of Journalism, ‘What’s The Story’ (2003), which noted that asylum debates tended to focus 
heavily on statistics and figures which were un-sourced.84 

3.17 

In his book, Democracy under Attack, Malcolm Dean of Sheffield University suggested that 
certain strands of press reporting on asylum and immigration (and often the strand which 
may  have  been  only  loosely  based  in  fact)  have  played  a  role  in  influencing  Government 
policy on these issues.85 

3.18  The submissions received in this area went a little further than simply criticising inaccuracies 
in reporting; they also claimed that there was a tendency in parts of the press to discriminate 
against  certain  minorities  and  to  inflame  tensions  or  exacerbate  difference.  The  Refugee 
Council suggested that some titles were less active than others86 in engaging with organisations 
who  work  with  the  relevant  communities  when  seeking  comments  for  articles  on  asylum 
and immigration: consequently, negative content is less likely to be balanced with positive 
stories.87  ENGAGE  drew  attention  to  a  report  by  the  Cardiff  School  of  Journalism,  Media 
and Cultural Studies which concluded that, between 2000 – 2008, references in the press to 
radical Muslims outnumbered references to moderate Muslims by 17 to one.88

Chapter 3 | Complaints of an Unethical PressF3.19  The  Runnymede  Trust  emphasised  its  concerns  in  relation  to  the  impact  of  inflammatory 
reporting  by  reference  to  an  article  published  in  the  NoTW  in  2003,  which  purported  to 
describe the cost of moving a refugee family. It ran under the headline: “Asylum Seekers’ Free 
£220 Taxi” with a sub heading, “and guess what… YOU’RE paying the fare.” Concerns with this 
article include the publication of a photograph of the family in question in which the faces 
of the children were clearly visible (in breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice), the failure 
adequately to disguise the location of the family’s new property (it was identifiable by door 
numbering and signage), the tone of the article, which included leading questions, “WHAT 
DO YOU THINK? Does it make you angry…?” in capital letters, and the failure of the article to 
make clear that train tickets for the family were more costly than the fare for the taxi. 

3.20  Concerns at the accuracy (as well as tone and content) of reporting in some parts of the press 
in relation to minority groups have also been raised elsewhere.89 In her evidence to the Inquiry, 
Helen Belcher on behalf of Trans Media Watch described what she regards as the frequently 
pejorative nature of reporting in some parts of the British press on transgender issues.90 The 
use of ‘before’ names as well as photographs of the individuals in question not only causes 
obvious distress but can place them at risk.91 Ms Belcher also claimed that the tone of much 
reporting was derogatory and intended to cause ridicule.92 She referred specifically to one 
article in The Sun which ran under the headline: “Sex swap mechanic goes nuts at medics”.93 
Apart from the inherently offensive nature of such language, Ms Belcher’s complaint was that 
it contributed to the shaping of public attitudes towards trans people. 

f

3.21  Responding to this evidence from Trans Media Watch,94 Dominic Mohan, the editor of The 
Sun, accepted that some reporting on these issues had been a “bit insensitive”, but claimed 
that it had improved.95 The title had worked hard with the Mermaid Trust, an organisation 
that supports transgender people, to improve the quality of its reporting and, indeed, had 
received praise from some quarters.96 Shortly after Helen Belcher had given evidence to the 
Inquiry, The Sun ran two further stories on transgender issues: one concerned coverage of a 
transsexual man who had given birth; the second to a five year old who had been born male 
but identified as a girl.97 In a further written submission to the Inquiry, Trans Media Watch 
suggested  that  both  stories  were  sensationalised  and  lacked  wider  context,  and  that  real 
privacy concerns around the identification of vulnerable people were ignored.98

3.22  Concerns at the damage that can be done by sensationalised reporting were also raised by 
Professionals Against Child Abuse (PACA), an organisation that represents the professionals 
who work in child care and social services. In its submission to the Inquiry, PACA set out its

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicbelief that sensationalised and sometimes inaccurate reporting of failings in social services 
were putting at risk the lives of vulnerable young people.99 PACA suggests that sensationalist 
reporting  is  damaging  the  profession  through  the  popular  vilification  of  individuals,  and 
is  impacting  on  retention  and  recruitment  across  the  children’s  care  sector.100  The  PACA 
submission refers to work undertaken by the Association of Directors of Children’s Services 
(ADCS), which notes the rise of child protection vacancies; and, following a survey of users, 
found that a third of respondents believed the effectiveness of advice being offered by health 
professionals has been adversely affected.101 A submission received from the Royal College 
of  Psychiatrists  also  reflects  similar  concerns  about  the  impact  of  press  reporting  on  the 
profession and on recruitment and retention.102 

3.23 

In its submission the Royal College of Psychiatrists also expressed concern at the impact that 
the sensationalising of crime can have both on the victims but also on the rehabilitation of 
the perpetrators and, in particular, young offenders.103 Likewise, the Youth Media Agency has 
suggested that the sensationalised reporting of youth crime and, specifically, the use of what 
it  describes  as  an  “overwhelmingly  negative  vernacular”  in  reporting  of  issues  relating  to 
young people risks harming their aspirations and opportunities.104 Citing the coverage of the 
August 2011 riots by some newspapers as an example of the sensationalising of the role of 
young people in topical events, this organisation noted that just 26% of rioters were identified 
as aged 10-17, a statistic which was by no means clear from the coverage in some papers.105

3.24  The role of the press in shaping public attitudes to rape and violence against women has 
been  criticised  in  evidence  submitted  by  End  Violence  Against  Women  Coalition  (EVAWC) 
and  EAVES  Housing.  The  latter’s  submission  cites  research  that  it  had  conducted  on  the 
press reporting and statistical realities of rape.106 It argues that in the British press there is a 
disproportionate coverage of the comparatively rare “stranger rape” stories and instances of 
falsely reported rapes, but reporting on the most common form of rape, which is committed 
by a person known to the victim, is infrequent.107 It suggests that the imbalance discourages 
victims to speak up and report their experiences, believing they do not fall within the “real 
rape” template.108 

3.25  Similarly,  the  EVAWC  submission  suggests  that  much  press  reporting  on  rape  serves  to 
perpetuate a number of societal myths around rape that are damaging both to victims and the 
criminal justice system as a whole. EVAWC notes reporting on a 2009 study which found that 
promiscuous men were more likely to commit rape.109 However, press coverage of that study, 
particularly in the Daily Telegraph, suggested that the research claimed that provocatively

Chapter 3 | Complaints of an Unethical PressFdressed  women  were  more  likely  to  be  sexually  assaulted.110  Although  the  headline  was 
removed from the Telegraph website following complaints from EVAWC and other women’s 
groups, EVAWC are concerned that the damage had been done.

3.26  These complaints of the trivialisation of violence towards women in some sections of the 
press are echoed in evidence received by the Inquiry from OBJECT. It argues that the frequent 
juxtaposition  in  the  tabloid  press  of  images  and  text  that  depict  women  as  sex  objects 
with stories of violence towards women trivialises that subject matter.111 In support of this 
proposition, OBJECT has submitted a number of articles published in The Sun, The Daily Star 
and The Sport in which this juxtaposition is evident. By way of example, OBJECT has drawn 
the attention of the Inquiry to a front page headline in The Sun which read: “Death threats 
to Harry girl”. That article was illustrated with a photograph of the young woman in question 
in her underwear. 

3.27  The  Inquiry  has  also  received  a  submission  from  Beat,  a  campaign  group  which  provides 
support for those tackling eating disorders. In its submission Beat expresses concern at what 
it alleges is the use of inappropriate images of severely emaciated women and men in some 
parts  of  the  press  to  illustrate  stories  on  anorexia  nervosa  and  other  eating  disorders.112 
Beat  contends  that  such  images  can  cause  harm  to  people  either  suffering  or  recovering 
from  eating  disorders,113  as  well  as  damage  to  the  public  awareness  of  such  disorders  by 
creating a false image of sufferers. That said, Beat also acknowledged recent and substantial 
improvements in the accuracy and tone of press reporting on these.114 

3.28 

f

It is worth repeating that both freedom of speech and freedom of the press permit wide 
latitude to editors and journalists to publish the stories they consider appropriate in the way 
that they wish.115 The Editors’ Code of Practice, however, requires care to be taken not to 
publish  inaccurate, misleading or distorted information (Clause 1(i)) and also requires the 
press  to  avoid  prejudicial  or  pejorative  reference  to  an  individual’s  race,  colour,  religion, 
gender, sexual orientation or to any physical or mental illness or disability (Clause 17(i)). That 
is the standard that the press has set for itself. The evidence touched on here, and addressed 
further below,116 includes reporting which falls at different points along a spectrum: some 
may  be  contentious,  opinionated  and  partial,  while  still  complying  with  the  standard  set; 
others may be inaccurate, prejudicial and discriminatory, and fall clearly on the wrong side of 
that standard. What is clear is that a critical mass of articles which breach the standard can 
have seriously deleterious effects on public discourse and community relations. 

Medical and scientific research

3.29  The Inquiry has also received a number of submissions from organisations working in medical 
and scientific research setting out concerns at what they perceive as the detrimental impact 
of the quality and accuracy of some reporting on issues relating to science and health policy. 
The Science Media Centre, through its director Fiona Fox, gave oral evidence to the Inquiry, 
and written submissions have been received from organisations such as the Wellcome Trust, 
Sense about Science, and the Cardiff University Brain Imaging Centre. Perhaps unsurprisingly,

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicall these organisations cite press reporting on the MMR vaccination following the publication 
of a case study in The Lancet in 1998 as an example of how journalism that they allege was 
both inaccurate and unbalanced led to a media generated health scare.117 Both the Wellcome 
Trust and Sense About Science have explained that in the immediate aftermath of the most 
intense period of coverage there was an estimated fall in vaccination rates of 61% in some 
areas of London,118 as well as a much lower take-up of the vaccination overall.119 This reduction 
is reported to have had a real impact on the risk that incidence of the diseases will increase 
with potentially serious consequences to those affected.

3.30  Similar, but more controversial, concerns have been raised by organisations in relation to the 
reporting of issues as diverse as climate change and drug addiction.120 It is unnecessary to do 
more than touch on these: the relevant submissions are available on the Inquiry website for 
public scrutiny. It goes without saying that the Inquiry has not undertaken the task of forming 
its own expert scientific judgment on this material and, in any event, it is unnecessary that it 
should do so.

3.31  This  body  of  evidence  emphasises  the  need  for  balanced  and  responsible  reporting  on 
matters of public interest and, in particular, reporting that reflects the balance of scientific 
and/or medical opinion on any specific issue. This need arises because the press is regarded 
as a reliable and responsible source of information; if it was not so regarded (and the press 
itself would hardly want it so), this issue would not arise. If, for example, the overwhelming 
preponderance of informed medical opinion is to the effect that a vaccine is safe, any reporting 
of  suggestive  evidence  to  the  contrary  effect  should  recognise  and  fairly  characterise  the 
nature  and  quality  of  that  evidence,  and  accord  proper  recognition  to  where  the  clear 
consensus of opinion lies. This is not to accord undue weight to the views of the scientific and 
medical establishment; rather, it is to accord due recognition to the strength of the available 
evidence to ensure that the position is not misrepresented. As the MMR story made clear, 
the failure to do so can have a widespread and harmful impact. 

Inaccuracy and harm: a wider perspective

3.32  Overall, there is a broader point which flows from the status and role of the press in a mature 
democracy as a reliable, authoritative and accurate purveyor of news and information. The 
press is trusted by its readers to adhere to high standards in terms of getting things right. 
The importance of differentiating between fact and opinion is that the public must be in a 
position to understand what is fact (and therefore to be relied on as such) and what is opinion 
(and therefore to be understood as precisely that). The public interest in facts being accurate 
is that readers may well be misled if they are not, their knowledge about the world may well 
be faulty as a result, and their judgments based on that knowledge may well be imperfect. 
The wider harm to the public interest of inaccurate journalism should be seen in that light. 

3.33  There is, of course, no bright line for the way that accurate facts are described, or for the 
choice of accurate facts that are reported and it is recognised that journalists do not have

the extent to which the Editors’ Code (or any agreed code) is followed ‘not only in the letter

prepared to address legitimate complaints in that regard.

Introduction
As Robert Jay QC said in opening the Inquiry:1

“In most institutions, cultural problems of this nature will usually emanate from high 
up within the organisation, but this will not always be the case. They will not always 
be the product of a deliberate policy decision made by those with power within the 
organisation to make them. Sometimes the existence of a culture derives from the 
operation of more subtle and complex forces, from historical trends, from what is 
condoned and not stamped upon, leading to insidious evolution and perpetuation, 
from complacency leading to arrogance and purblindness. There is clearly a range of 
possibilities.”

1.2 

There is an extent to which News International (NI) and the rest of the press have sought to 
draw a line between the practices that are alleged to have taken place at the News of the 
World (the NoTW) and the newsrooms of all other newspapers. Having argued originally that 
phone hacking was limited to one rogue reporter, one may be forgiven for thinking that the 
company and sections of the industry are now arguing that it was limited to one rogue title. 
On account of the ongoing criminal prosecutions2 it is not possible for Part One of this Inquiry 
to investigate the allegations of illegal behaviour that surround the NoTW, and neither is it a 
matter for Part One to reach firm conclusions as to whether similar illegal behaviour has been 
engaged in elsewhere in given specified titles. The goal of Part One of the Inquiry is to discern 
the broad contours of the culture, practices and ethics of the press and reach conclusions on 
the extent to which those meet public expectations and support the public interest. Given 
the extent of the allegations against the NoTW, and the widespread view that the NoTW was 
not typical of the rest of national newspapers, I have focused in this Chapter of the Report on 
the culture at the NoTW. Elsewhere, I consider whether what may be described as the wider 
culture of the press was and is reflected in or by the culture of the NoTW (or not).

1.3 

The criminal investigations and the many civil actions brought against the NoTW in relation 
to phone hacking mean there is a vast fund  of information about  alleged illegal practices 
in the hands of both NI, the police and in the High Court. However, the ongoing criminal 
investigations mean that the Inquiry has not been able to delve into any of this evidence and 
has been constrained in the areas of questioning that might have been pursued with many of 
those who were employed by the NoTW. Further, NI has drawn attention to the fact that they 
have not attempted to put forward a positive case in relation to the NoTW and has argued, 
therefore, that in the context of the Inquiry the NoTW is an ‘undefended party’.3 

1.4 

The  NoTW  is,  indeed,  in  a  unique  position.  The  title  was  closed  down  in  July  2011  by  NI 
in  response  to  the  public  distaste  for  what  had  been  revealed  about  the  widespread  use

of  phone  hacking  as  a  technique  at  the  paper,  and  in  particular  the  alleged  targeting  of 
ordinary people and the victims of crime such as Milly Dowler. As previously explained, in 
respect of Operations Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta, NI has provided substantial quantities of 
information to the police relating to NoTW operations. A number of former NoTW journalists 
and executives have been arrested and charged, both in relation to phone hacking and other 
offences. Although the Inquiry has taken evidence from many of those involved it was not 
possible to ask questions about any issue that is the subject of criminal investigation, with 
the result that the picture presented is partial. This is a necessary consequence of what I have 
called the ‘mantra’4 but, in any event, I am not seeking to present a detailed account of how 
things happened in the NoTW newsroom. 

Rather, I am aiming to sketch out an impression of what was considered important at the 
NoTW, what the priorities were, how people behaved and what the prevailing attitudes were 
to ethical and legal constraints, the rights of individuals and the Editors’ Code. The picture 
set out here is gathered from the evidence of a number of people who have worked at the 
newspaper over last ten or so years. None has been able to give a full account, and given the 
frank  inconsistencies  between  some  of  the  accounts  that  I  have  received  (taken  together 
with other reasons such as my assessment of them as witnesses) I am driven to conclude 
that not everything I have heard has been accurate or, in some cases, truthful. That said, I 
believe that the resulting picture is sufficiently robust to stand as a recognisable portrait of 
how the organisation operated over that period, without seeking to concentrate on, or draw 
conclusions about, the alleged illegal behaviour that is the subject of current or potential 
police investigations.

2.1 

Influence	on	culture	at	the	News	of	the	World
This chapter will consider a number of different aspects of culture, practices and ethics at the 
NoTW, namely:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

the impact of those in the most senior positions on the rest of the organisation: the 
chain  of  events  surrounding  the  prosecution  of  Glenn  Mulcaire  and  Clive  Goodman 
and the civil litigation, in particular Mr Gordon Taylor’s claim, provide an important and 
powerful  insight  into  accountability  and  responsibility  within  the  upper  echelons  of 
the NoTW. These issues have already been covered in considerable detail above,5 and I 
reiterate here those findings and assessments;
the culture in the newsroom: how responsibility is handled at working level and the 
behaviour of the senior team towards their staff; 
the pressures on journalists and editors: including how they inform actions and can 
influence the culture of the organisation; 
the  attitude  within  the  newsroom  towards  individuals  who  were  the  subjects  of 
potential stories: including what attitudes to privacy, as well as methods of persuading 
people to co-operate, can tell us about culture; 
approaches  to  compliance,  including  the  approach  to  data  protection,  with  specific 
reference  to  Operation  Motorman,  the  approach  to  legal  compliance,  dealing  with 
complaints and attitudes to accuracy; and

finally, the relationship between the paper and the public, with reference to how the 
paper considers the wider public interest and its approach to public scrutiny.

2.2 

Setting the tone from the top
In relation to the NoTW, the relevant influences on the culture and operation of the newspaper 
appear to be the ultimate owner of the title, the NI management, the editorial and executive 
team at the NoTW, the exigencies of operating as a Sunday title and the pervading culture 
and practices of the UK press and UK journalism. What follows attempts to describe the effect 
of some of these different influences. 

2.3 

If the culture is set from the top of an organisation then, in seeking to understand the culture 
at  the  NoTW,  it  is  essential  to  look  at  the  approach  taken  by  the  ultimate  owner.  Rupert 
Murdoch, speaking no doubt in his capacity as Chairman of News Corp, told the Inquiry:6

“I do try very hard to set an example of ethical behaviour and make it quite clear that 
I expect it. One can describe that in a number of ways. But do I do it via an aura or 
charisma? I don’t think so.” 

Talking generally about the role of his newspapers he said:

“It was always to tell the truth, certainly to interest the public, to get their attention, 
but always to tell the truth.”

He said that he felt that the public were the best arbiters of what should be in newspapers.7

2.4 

In describing the specific ‘brand’ of the NoTW, Mr Murdoch said:8

“It’s a campaigning newspaper….certainly it was interested in celebrities, just as the 
public is, and a much greater investment went into covering the weekend soccer….. 
Coverage of celebrities, yes. Salacious gossip? Meaning – I take gossip as meaning 
unfounded stories about celebrities: no. I certainly hope not.” 

2.5  Mr James Murdoch described the brand of the NoTW as:9

“an investigative newspaper with exposés and the like, wasn’t only concerned with 
celebrities  and  salacious  gossip,  but  also  uncovering  real  wrongdoing,  scandals, 
campaigning and so on and so forth.” 

James Murdoch told the Inquiry that the culture at the NoTW when he joined as Chief Executive 
was very different from that at BSkyB. He said that he wanted it to be ‘more collaborative’.10

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFCode enforcement 

2.6  When Colin Myler arrived at the NoTW he reviewed the protocols and systems in place and 
introduced changes where he thought they were necessary to improve the governance within 
the NoTW.11 This included an amendment to the standard employment contract to make it:12

“...abundantly  clear  that  the  employee  understands  and  accepts  that  failure  to 
comply with the requirement, which was PCC, criminal law, will lead to disciplinary 
proceedings, which may result in summary dismissal.” 

However, Mr Myler went on to say that during his time as editor there were no instances 
where failure to comply with the Code led to disciplinary proceedings.13 He was able to recall 
one case that led to an oral warning and one that led to a written warning, but no others.14 
This is particularly surprising in the light of the adverse adjudications, mediated complaints 
and defamation actions settled during the period (as to which see paragraph 2.33 below) 
most, if not all, of which must, almost by definition, have breached the Code in some way. 

2.7 

2.8 

The culture in the newsroom
In  looking  at  the  culture  of  an  organisation,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  relationships 
between the organisation and its staff, how responsibility was handled at working level and, 
more particularly, what the NoTW was like to work for. 

The Inquiry heard a number of different perspectives on what really mattered at the NoTW. 
Paul McMullan, former deputy features editor, described the raison d’être of the NoTW as 
“chasing circulation and nothing else.”15 He spoke repeatedly and passionately about the fact 
that NoTW had the highest circulation of the national papers and that the readers appeared 
to welcome the sort of stories that he wrote: 16

“But the reality was it was bought in its millions. This is what the people of Britain 
want. I was simply serving their need, their – what they wanted to read.” 

In one of the most provocative statements made to the Inquiry, Mr McMullan said that: 17

“in a bizarre way, I felt slightly proud that I’d written something that created a riot 
and got a paediatrician beaten up, or whatever was the case,” 

as if he was delighted to feel (or glorified in the fact) that he had written an article that had 
moved  people  to  action,  even  if  the  action  itself  had  been  utterly  misguided  and  wrong.

2.9  Mazher Mahmood, an investigative journalist who has specialised in undercover exposures 
and ‘stings’, advanced a different view. He explained that he was motivated by public duty 
and exposing wrongdoing, so much so that not all his investigations had been with a view to

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFeventual publication in the newspaper.18 In discussion of a Court of Appeal finding that his 
real priorities were as a journalist wanting to publish a story, Mr Mahmood said:19

“Of course, our motive is to publish an article in the newspaper. I’m not a police officer, 
I’m not a social worker; I’m a journalist.”

2.10  An alternative view to that expressed by Mr Mahmood of what was driving people in the 
NoTW newsroom was provided by Stuart Hoare, on the basis of the discussions he had had 
with his late brother, Sean, a journalist at the newspaper, suggesting that the main aim was 
to deliver a story and deliver it as quickly as possible: 20

“it seems, you know, as though no one was in control. As long as they delivered an 
article,  whether  it  could  stand  up  or  not  didn’t  really  matter,  but  as  long  as  they 
delivered something, and if they delivered something early on in the week, then all 
the better because they can go and do whatever they want to do for the rest of the 
week. It was a very strange world that they operated in.”

2.11 

It is difficult to assess the reliability of the evidence bearing on these differing perspectives, 
for at least two reasons. First, it has to be recognised that Mr McMullan’s evidence needs 
to be treated with very real caution given his tendency to exaggerate and sensationalise. He 
was not an attractive witness, although ultimately I conclude that his evidence did contain a 
substantial kernel of truth, once the elaboration is removed. Secondly, and notwithstanding 
my reservations about certain aspects of Mr Mahmood’s evidence which I address elsewhere, 
I am prepared to accept that he personally felt that he was discharging some sort a public 
function rather than merely generating commercial gain for himself and his employer. That 
said, the evidence of Messrs Hoare and McMullan does not stand alone and I have reached 
the conclusion that in broad and general terms, exaggeration aside, it does serve to identify 
at least one of the key drivers of culture at the NoTW.

2.12 

Pressures on journalists
It seems clear, therefore, that a drive for circulation increased the pressure on those working 
at  the  NoTW.  The  Inquiry  heard  from  a  number  of  former  employees  of  the  newspaper 
who  were  in  complete  agreement  that  the  newsroom  at  NoTW  was  a  very  pressurised 
environment and that reporters were under pressure to deliver stories, preferably exclusive 
stories, regularly. Mr McMullan said that the consequence of not getting sufficient bylines 
was  that  you  would  get  fired.21  Neville  Thurlbeck  (who  had  occupied  a  number  of  senior 
positions as a journalist on the NoTW) told the Inquiry:22

“there  was  a  kind  of  an  unofficial  recognition  that  bylines  were  a  reasonable 
performance  indicator,  and  if  your  byline  count  was  low,  then  obviously  your  job 
would be in jeopardy.”

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF2.13  Other journalists said the same thing. Daniel Sanderson, a former journalist at the paper, said 
that the environment of the newsroom was highly pressured and that you had to be available 
all the time.23 Matt Driscoll, another former journalist who left the newspaper suffering from 
stress, said that there were lots of pressures on a news staffer at the NoTW to perform and 
get stories. He mentioned the pressures to get a story, to sell the paper, and to get a big front 
page exclusive.24 Mr Driscoll also recounted his doctor’s assessment of the pressure applied 
to journalists which was in terms that:25

“journalists work under an incredible amount of pressure and stress, and it was his 
opinion that you get used to that level of stress. You just think that’s normal. You 
know, the high sort of fast lane of Fleet Street does take its toll. You travel around the 
world, you work at a great pace, so if something doesn’t go quite right, you can quite 
easily get tipped over the edge. You’re used to a high level of stress, but you’re almost 
at saturation point.”

2.14  This picture of a newsroom under immense pressure was supported by anonymous evidence 
received  from  the  National  Union  of  Journalists  (NUJ).  As  discussed  below,  such  was  the 
concern about the risk of repercussions for journalists giving evidence to the Inquiry that an 
application was made by the NUJ that I should be prepared to receive evidence anonymously. 
I acceded but, inevitably, treat the resulting evidence far more cautiously as a consequence. 
One journalist wrote that there was tremendous pressure at the NoTW, that everyone talked 
about the byline count and reporters had to do what they needed to get the story.26 Another 
said “The NoTW was an incredibly tough and unforgiving workplace” and described seeing 
three or four members of staff collapse in the office in consequence, at least in part, from 
stress,  as  well  as  himself  or  herself  having  suffered  from  severe  stress.27  Sharon  Marshall 
described the NoTW as ‘a very tough working environment’ where you literally would not 
know what the person next to you was doing.28 

2.15  Whilst the picture of the NoTW as a tough and demanding, often stressful, working environment 
was not challenged by any of the evidence before the Inquiry, there was no such agreement 
on whether this toughness extended to bullying. Some have argued very clearly that that 
there was a bullying culture at the NoTW. Mr Driscoll told the Inquiry of his dismissal from the 
NoTW and the subsequent Employment Tribunal hearing. The Tribunal found that then editor 
of the NoTW, Andy Coulson, had ‘presided over a culture of bullying’ 29 as well as specifying 
particular instances of behaviour by the editor that it considered to constitute bullying.30 The 
Tribunal further found that the disciplinary proceedings leading up to Mr Driscoll’s dismissal 
had been a pretext for the then editor’s desire to ‘get shot of’ Mr Driscoll.31 The Tribunal felt

a cynical process of giving an appearance of fairness towards Mr Driscoll.32 

2.16  The Tribunal’s findings were not the subject of any appeal by NI to the Employment Appeal 
Tribunal, notwithstanding the very substantial award of compensation to Mr Driscoll. However, 
it  cannot  be  overlooked  that  Mr  Coulson  did  not  give  evidence  before  the  Employment 
Tribunal, despite the fact that he has subsequently said that he wished to do so, and that 
he has sought to challenge the findings of fact made by the Tribunal. Whatever his account 
now, I am not prepared to permit Mr Coulson or NI to re-litigate issues which, if they were 
live, could and (in my view) should have been argued before the Employment Tribunal at the 
appropriate time.

2.17 

Ian Edmondson was the news editor at the NoTW for much of the relevant period. He agreed 
that there was a culture of bullying, saying that it emanated from the editor. He said this 
was true even for senior executives such as himself: “It’s not a democracy at a newspaper. 
Autocratic.”33 A number of the journalists providing evidence anonymously through the NUJ 
echoed this perception, including one who described repeated bullying of themselves and 
colleagues,34 and another who described what amounted to bullying of Clive Goodman.35 A 
third described a ‘systematic regime of bullying’ at the NoTW.36 These journalists describe 
their experience of being bullied and seeing others bullied in graphic detail. Steve Turner, 
of the British Association of Journalists gave evidence of at least three cases, other than Mr 
Driscoll, of bullying at the NoTW in each of which:37

“...the  journalist  was  unreasonably  subjected  to  disciplinary  proceedings,  realised 
that the newspaper felt his face did not fit any more and that they were trying to 
drive him out, and asked him if a severance package was available to resolve the 
matter.”

2.18  Others disagreed. Mr Sanderson was clear that he did not recognise the picture painted by 
other witnesses of a bullying culture at the title.38 Another, Dan Wootton (who worked in 
Features  before  becoming  TV  editor  and  then  Showbiz  editor)  was  confident  that  he  had 
experienced no bullying culture at the NoTW, although he ascribed this to his having worked 
on the Features desk and to different parts of the paper having different cultures.39 Rupert 
Murdoch said that he was not aware of any allegations of bullying at NoTW or within NI, 
stating “they always strike me as a very happy crowd,”40 but made it clear that the type of 
conduct found to have occurred in the Driscoll case had no place in NI newsrooms.41

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF2.19  NI cautions the Inquiry about reaching any conclusion about a culture of bullying based on 
the allegations of a single individual or even a handful of individuals.42 However, Mr Myler 
explained  that  when  he  became  editor,  he  ran  a  staff  survey  asking  about  the  working 
environment. The responses were clear that they had a long way to go to meet the aspirations 
of the staff. Mr Myler went on to say that his response included holding seminars for the heads 
of departments on how to welcome challenge and to avoid bullying. Mr Myler indicated that 
the subsequent year’s survey results were much improved, putting the NoTW ahead of the 
rest of NI.43 This lends some weight to the concerns of others that a bullying culture did, at 
least to an extent and prior to 2009, exist in the NoTW, as well as indicating that some steps 
were taken to address it. 

2.20 

2.21 

It must be recognised that not all the evidence offered can be taken at face value and, in 
particular, as I have said, I must be very careful about placing too much reliance on the evidence 
of anonymous journalists unless it is converges with other reliable evidence. However, in the 
light of the body of consistent evidence which the Inquiry has received, and of Mr Myler’s 
evidence (which is not challenged by anybody) there can be little doubt that the NoTW was 
a tough working environment, that the staff collectively felt that challenge from superiors 
was not welcomed, and that bullying was a problem. The evidence which Mr Driscoll gave 
to  the  Employment  Tribunal,  repeated  to  me,  along  with  the  confirmation  of  witnesses 
(both identified and anonymous) satisfies me that, at least on occasion, individuals  were, 
indeed, victimised and bullied. Whilst Mr Myler took steps to address the culture that he 
obviously perceived as being harmful, there was no evidence that any individuals responsible 
for bullying, or creating a climate at the paper which was unhealthy and oppressive, were 
disciplined in any way or that the victims were offered any support. 

In any event, whether the pressures to perform amounted to bullying or not, it has been 
suggested  by  a  number  of  witnesses  that  these  pressures,  both  to  deliver  a  story  and  to 
deliver  sufficient  evidence  to  make  it  legally  defensible,  may  have  led  journalists  to  use 
whatever  means  were  necessary,  even  if  that  meant  stepping  beyond  the  Editors’  Code 
or  the  law.  Mr  McMullan  described  the  attitude  of  a  previous  editor,  Piers  Morgan,  as  “I 
want that story at all costs” and “I don’t care what you have to do to get that story”.44 He 
recounted a specific incident alleging that Mr Morgan, against the advice of Rebekah Brooks, 
had actively encouraged him to steal a photograph from a private house: 45 quite apart from 
the unsatisfactory nature of parts of Mr McMullan’s evidence, that allegation was not put to 
Mr Morgan and I make no finding about it. 

2.22  On the other hand, James Hanning (deputy editor of the Independent on Sunday) reported 
Sean Hoare suggesting that his impression was that getting stories that could be printed was 
more important than professional standards.46 Mr Driscoll told the Inquiry that there was 
pressure to go along with using unethical or illegal methods to stand up a story:47

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF“it  would  be  a  very  brave  journalist…to  suddenly  say  ‘I’m  not  happy  with  these 
techniques that are being used.’…..Anyone on that floor who complained too much 
would find themselves pushed out, certainly.” 

Mr Driscoll went on to say:48

“there was a pressure to use, as it now turns out, almost any means necessary to 
make sure that a story was 100 per cent true.” 

2.23  Mr Edmondson described an environment where anyone in the newsroom had to comply 
with  an  instruction  from  the  editor,  even  when  the  editor’s  instruction  might  be  morally 
or ethically questionable. He said that an instruction from Mr Myler (denied by Mr Myler) 
that he misled Clarence Mitchell, the PR assistant to the McCann family, about the NoTW’s 
position in relation to Dr Kate McCann’s diaries was a particularly egregious example of an 
instruction effectively to deceive someone, but that there had been other occasions.49

2.24  Mr Hoare described how he believed that his brother, Sean, had felt pressure to drink and 
take drugs in order to be able to do his job effectively, as he relied on mixing socially within 
the entertainment world.50 Mr Hanning also described how Mr Hoare had felt that there was 
great pressure to perform and that he was put under increasing pressure when things were 
going less well.51 

2.25  Again, this general picture is reflected in the anonymous evidence given through the NUJ. 
One such witness said “if you’ve got people who are hacking phones and producing great 
stories, the honest reporter is thinking they’re not in the same league, that something’s wrong 
with them”.52 Another complained of pressure to deliver too quickly:53 

“There’d be no time to make calls and get things right……..There was [one time] when 
I had to make up a quote – it was only once….I felt terrible. But I didn’t have a choice 
and I had to get the piece done.” 

A third said:54

“I never made stuff up but the pressure on people was enormous.”

2.26  Other  witnesses  were  clear  that  they  had  not  felt  under  pressure  to  behave  improperly 
in pursuit of stories or evidence. Mr Thurlbeck spoke of the “enormous lengths” to which 
they  went  to  satisfy  the  lawyers  as  to  factual  accuracy,  asserting  that  only  proper  means

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFwere used to achieve that aim.55 Mr Sanderson said that he had no experience of working in 
uncomfortable situations, or of being forced to behave against the Editors’ Code.56 

2.27 

Approach to discipline
It is interesting to consider the NoTW’s approach to staff who committed breaches of the 
Editors’  Code  or  been  found  to  have  broken  the  law.  Mr  Myler  explained  that  it  was  the 
practice that a journalist who failed to meet PCC Code standards would receive a written 
reprimand, though he could only recall one example of this happening from his four year 
tenure as editor.57 According to Mr Myler, this was sometimes also the case in relation to 
lapses that did not lead to a PCC complaint.58 

2.28  When Mr Thurlbeck was found by the High Court to have sent emails to potential interviewees 
which could be said to be tantamount to blackmail,59 no action was taken against him by 
the NoTW in connection with the incident; neither does it appear that there was even a re-
evaluation of the propriety of what had been done.60 I shall return to the issue of these emails 
at a later stage of this review of the culture at the NoTW. 

2.29  The treatment of Clive Goodman, as set out above,61 was also instructive. Mr Goodman had 
been found guilty of a criminal offence and served a prison sentence for it. This is clearly 
grounds for dismissal under the News International Disciplinary Policy. Indeed, “[c]onviction 
for a criminal offence which may bring News International into disrepute…” is given as an 
example  of  gross  misconduct  which  could  lead  to  dismissal  without  notice  or payment in 
lieu of notice.62 However, as Mr Crone explained, Mr Goodman was given indications that he 
would be able to return to the NoTW.63 In the event that, did not happen and Mr Goodman 
was dismissed, but he did secure in the region of £250,000 in payments and legal expenses 
in circumstances where one would have thought that his strict legal entitlement, regardless 
of any technical want of fairness by the company in its dismissal procedures, were nugatory 
or non-existent.64 

2.30  There are different possible interpretations of the rationale for why there was any possibility 
or suggestion that Mr Goodman might have been taken back to work at the NoTW. One, 
put  forward  by  Mr  Goodman  himself  in  his  unfair  dismissal  claim,  was  that  management 
recognised that Mr Goodman was operating within normal and accepted practice at the NoTW 
and it would be unfair for him to be dismissed as a result. Consequently it was appropriate, 
at least, for him to be compensated if he was not going to be able to keep his job. Another 
possible  interpretation  suggested  was  that  executives  at  the  newspaper  felt  a  sense  of

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFpaternal responsibility for Mr Goodman and his family and that they did not want them to 
be too heavily penalised for one mistake when set against a long and (largely) honourable 
career. A further interpretation is that, given his knowledge of inappropriate activity at the 
NoTW, by keeping him on the staff, Mr Goodman could be persuaded to keep such matters 
confidential. Mr Crone has denied that there was any ‘keep your mouth shut’ element to the 
indications given to Mr Goodman that he might have a job at the NoTW after his release from 
prison.65 

2.31  Any  one  of  these  arguments  might  also  explain  the  willingness  of  the  NoTW  to  reach  a 
substantial settlement with Mr Goodman once he had been dismissed. Jon Chapman, former 
head  of  legal  and  corporate  affairs  at  NI,  told  the  Inquiry  that  the  NoTW  settled  with  Mr 
Goodman because they did not want to face the reputational damage of allegations being 
repeated in an Employment Tribunal.66 Mr Chapman’s contention was that the allegations 
were  unsubstantiated  but  nonetheless  damaging.  There  would  be  an  equal  rationale  for 
persuading Mr Goodman not to repeat his allegations if they were, in fact, substantiated. 

2.32  What  is  particularly  striking  are  the  differences  between  the  treatment  of  Mr  Thurlbeck 
and Mr Goodman, on the one hand, and Mr Driscoll on the other. Whilst Mr Goodman was 
dismissed,  it  took  some  considerable  while  for  that  conclusion  to  be  reached.  No  formal 
action was taken against Mr Thurlbeck whatsoever, and any informal reprimand was offered 
only long after the event. Both of these cases involved unlawful (or potentially tantamount 
to unlawful) behaviour and breaches of the Code. By contrast Mr Driscoll had broken neither 
the Code nor the internal rules of the NoTW and was dismissed as rapidly and with as little 
personal consideration or compensation as possible.67 

2.33  Looked at more broadly, the Inquiry has seen no evidence that the policy set out by Mr Myler, 
that breaches of the Editors’ Code would result in a written reprimand, was implemented 
or enforced. NI has not provided any examples of such written reprimands, despite at least 
17 upheld PCC complaints against the NoTW, including five since 2007,68 and 19 defamation 
actions  since  2005  including  12  settled.69  Mr  Myler  cited  four  cases  in  which  the  PCC 
adjudicated against the NoTW while he was editor.70 The Inquiry has been given no evidence 
of  disciplinary  action  having  been  taken  in  response  to  those  breaches  of  the  PCC  Code 
despite Mr Myler’s assertion that it would have done so. Some five people were dismissed 
from NoTW in the period from 2005-2011 for misconduct, three of them in 2011, and no 
information is provided about what constituted misconduct in these cases. The example of 
Mr Driscoll demonstrates that this will not always relate to a breach of the Code. 

2.34  Some NoTW journalists were clear that the Code was distributed to staff and they were made 
aware of their obligation to follow it. Dan Wootton confirmed that he attended a PCC seminar

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFon the day that he joined the NoTW and was provided with a copy of the PCC Code that day, 
which he would carry with him at all times.71 Ms Marshall echoed this, saying:72

“when you start at the News of the World, you’re given a copy of the PCC code. Every 
journalist should know what the PCC code is. You wouldn’t be reminded of it on a 
daily basis. You should know it.”

2.35  Ms Marshall told the Inquiry that she had resigned from the NoTW because she had been 
asked by her manager to do something which she considered unethical: she was told to put 
a story to a subject in a way and at a time that she considered inappropriate. In the event 
she did not comply with the request and no story ran. Ms Marshall said that the editor and 
deputy editor had not been aware of this request until she resigned and that they had tried 
to persuade her to stay.73 However, she left, and the person responsible for the request had 
stayed in their job.74 Ms Marshall also told the Inquiry that she was not aware of anyone 
having been disciplined for an ethical breach.75 

2.36  As previously observed, not all the evidence adduced as to the pressure on staff to use all 
means possible,  whether or not they were ethical or legal, to get a story and stand it up 
can be taken at face value. I repeat that only limited weight or reliance can be placed on 
uncorroborated anonymous evidence, and the evidence of Mr McMullan, Mr Driscoll, Mr 
Edmondson and Mr Hanning is challenged by NI on various grounds of unreliability. On the 
other  hand,  whereas  aspects  of  NI’s  challenges  are,  no  doubt,  well-founded,  for  reasons 
earlier explained, I have concluded that the evidence of these and other similar witnesses 
contains a substantial kernel of truth. 

2.37 

It goes further. Mr Thurlbeck’s continued denials of the use of improper means at the NoTW 
ring hollow in the face of the conclusions of Mr Justice Eady that he had resorted to a tactic 
that  could  be  considered  tantamount  to  blackmail;  the  fact  that,  even  now,  he  does  not 
accept any lack of propriety on his part speaks volumes. The evidence of how the NoTW 
treated staff who had gone too far clearly suggests that while there may not have been overt 
pressure to breach the Code or break the law, there was an attitude that expected results and 
that did not actively discourage, or penalise those who went beyond the boundaries of what 
was proper. 

3.	 Attitude	towards	individuals
3.1 

The  attitude  within  the  newsroom  towards  individuals  who  were  the  subject  of  potential 
stories, including specifically attitudes to privacy, shines a bright light onto the culture of a 
newsroom. This sub-section of the Report covers ground which is also addressed on a more 
generic basis below,76 but it is convenient and appropriate to address here similar issues in 
the specific context of the NoTW.

3.2 

The Inquiry has seen two distinct attitudes towards the subjects of stories or potential stories. 
The first is that celebrities or subjects must be humoured and nurtured in order for stories

individuals as commodities, and their interests solely from the perspective of legal risk to the 
company. There are three aspects of the treatment of individuals by the NoTW that I examine 
here: 

(a) 

the approach to privacy, including the attitudes to Article 8 rights, use of intrusion and 
surveillance;

(b)  pressure put on people to co-operate; and 

(c) 

deception, including blagging, and other investigative techniques.

Privacy

3.3 

The Inquiry heard that, whereas libel had always been an issue for newspapers, concerns 
about  privacy  were  more  recent.  Mr  Crone  said  that  privacy  considerations  had  become 
more important as case law on privacy developed, dating that from approximately 2002/3.77 
He gave evidence that privacy incrementally became more important as a result. Mr Myler 
described how, coming back to the UK in 2007 after five years in the United States, the privacy 
landscape was unrecognisable:78

“As a result of challenges and the change in the law, as it were, and verdicts, it was 
becoming very challenging to meet the requirements that the courts had laid down.” 

This, he said, led him to approach privacy issues with a cautious frame of mind.79 Mr Thurlbeck 
said that privacy had become an important issue since 2008.80 Before then, he said, there was 
less regard to privacy issues although there was always an awareness that there had to be 
“an element of justification behind it.”81 It is notable that, in the case of both Mr Crone and 
Mr Myler, this increased caution with respect to privacy was driven by the development of 
law surrounding privacy, not by the requirements of the Editors’ Code or any general ethical 
considerations or changes in what the reading public were willing to support. 

3.4 

The Inquiry heard evidence from a number of NoTW staff in  relation  to both  the general 
approach to privacy and to specific incidents involving a breach of privacy. Mr McMullan was 
at the extreme end of the lack of respect for privacy, informing the Inquiry:82

“In  21  years  of  invading  people’s  privacy  I’ve  never  actually  come  across  anyone 
who’s been doing  any good.  The only  people I think need privacy are people who 
do bad things. Privacy is the space bad people need to do bad things in. Privacy is 
particularly good for paedophiles, and if you keep that in mind, privacy is for paedos, 
fundamental, no one else needs it, privacy is evil. It brings out the worst qualities in 
people. It brings out hypocrisy. It allows them to do bad things.”

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF3.5  Mr McMullan argued that he saw no distinction between the public interest and what the 
public was interested in.83 This line of argument led him to suggest that the level of sales of the 
NoTW demonstrated that its stories were essentially in the public interest.84 He specifically 
recounted a story, in which he had been involved, that led to the subject ultimately killing 
herself. He recalled this story with regret, but continued to believe that there was no need for 
controls on privacy because the public did not seem to have a problem with the coverage:85

“…because the News of the World readership didn’t decline after that. It didn’t put 
anyone off buying it.” 

3.6  Mr Mahmood argued that someone holding public office should have no right to privacy. By 
contrast, he suggested that in the case of those not holding office, any intrusion into privacy 
would need to be justified, for example on the grounds of exposing hypocrisy.86 

3.7  Mr Thurlbeck described a newsroom in which the question of whether privacy was being 
intruded into, and the justification for any such intrusion, was the subject of lengthy debates 
with the editor:87

“It was something we talked about literally every day…..we did everything we could 
to ensure that we didn’t step over those boundary marks.”

3.8  Mr  Sanderson  said  that  in  every  story  he  would  consider  privacy,  the  public  interest  and 
whether  he  was  adhering  to  the  Editors’  Code.  However,  he  was  unable  to  point  to  any 
consideration of breach of privacy in relation to the acquisition of the diaries of Dr McCann, 
appearing to feel that the matter would be satisfactorily covered by obtaining the consent of 
the McCanns to any proposed publication.88 

3.9 

Describing the attitude of executives to privacy, Mr Crone said that he was sometimes asked 
to advice on what attitude a court might take in relation to the privacy aspects of a case:89

“I would express the view that they were probably going to get into trouble over it. 
That wasn’t always accepted in terms of ‘we won’t publish it’, no.” 

He explained that the executive’s view of the public interest in publishing was not always in 
line with his (Mr Crone’s) assessment of what a court would find.90

3.10  Mr Wallis said that the NoTW had a policy until the early 2000s to make a 4 o’clock Saturday 
afternoon telephone call to the subject of an exposé, but that that was now impossible.91 He 
explained:92

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF“As the success of late-night Saturday injunctions increased, for reasons that were 
subject to debate and some discussion in the media and in the legal profession, it 
became clear that whatever the rights and wrongs of a case, it was becoming much 
more easy – easier for a judge to grant an injunction. If you – if that injunction was 
granted, that means (a) that you – all that hard work had to go on hold, and (b) it 
stopped becoming yours, because it then became out to the rest of the world. Because 
if you fought the injunction, it would be heard on a nice comfortable Thursday or 
Friday morning in the High Court and you, as a Sunday newspaper, have your story all 
over the daily newspapers.”

3.11  There are very real tensions between what the Inquiry has been told, for the most part, about 
the general approach to privacy, which suggested a careful consideration of the issues raised, 
and the actual decisions taken, and rationale for those decisions, in specific cases. A prime 
example of this is the publication of the story about Mr Mosley. It is not necessary to set out 
in detail the facts of the Mosley case, which can be found in the judgment of Mr Justice Eady 
in Max Mosley v News Group Newspapers.93 In short, the NoTW published a series of stories 
alleging that Mr Mosley, the then head of the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), 
had taken part in a ‘Nazi themed orgy’. The newspaper also published online a video of Mr 
Mosley engaged in sado-masochistic sex, alleging this be evidence of the Nazi orgy. In fact, 
the allegation of a Nazi theme was held by the court to have no basis in fact, but was no doubt 
an attractive headline for the newspaper and its readership on account of the fact that Mr 
Mosley is the son of former British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley. The revelations 
in the NoTW were incredibly damaging to Mr Mosley and his family and amounted to a gross 
breach of his private life. 

3.12 

In this case, Mr Thurlbeck could not remember with any precision when the public interest in 
breaching Mr Mosley’s privacy was considered. He was clear that he had no such conversation 
with the editor, Mr Myler, but did think he had discussed the issue with the news editor both 
when he started to research the story and throughout. Despite his earlier characterisation 
of regular and lengthy debates with the editor on privacy issues (see paragraph 3.7 above), 
when asked whether he thought it appropriate to discuss the public interest in invading Mr 
Mosley’s privacy with the editor, Mr Thurlbeck said:94

“In the normal course of events I would talk to the news editor”.

3.13  Mr Thurlbeck was clear that decisions on prior notification of the subjects of stories was a 

matter for the news desk. He said:95

“I  would  always  wait  for  an  instruction  from  the  news  desk  before  revealing  our 
hand…and on this occasion I wasn’t told, therefore I assumed we weren’t putting the 
allegations to him…..”

3.14  The editor, Mr Myler, and legal advisor, Mr Crone, did remember considering privacy issues in 
relation to Mr Mosley. Mr Crone’s view at the time was that if Mr Mosley was told in advance 
about the story there was a good chance that a pre-publication injunction would be granted. 
For  this  reason,  and  to  guard  against  leaks,  he  advised  against  notifying  Mr  Mosley.96  Mr

507

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFMyler agreed that he believed that had Mr Mosley applied for an injunction he was likely to 
have been successful.97 

3.15  Mr Crone said that he was not asked to advise on whether the video should be put on the 
website. He said, “I thought it was pushing it to put up the video,” but at no time did he advise 
that it should not be put up, or that it should be taken down.98 It seems clear that there 
was no systematic consideration of the propriety of invading Mr Mosley’s privacy (or that of 
the other parties to the event), other than in the context of how to ensure that Mr Mosley 
was not put in a position to exercise his right to privacy by seeking an injunction to prevent 
publication. Mr Thurlbeck noted that one of the risks of an injunction application was that 
during the period of any interim injunction the story might leak out and the paper would lose 
its commercial advantage from the story.99

3.16 

In the event, when Mr Mosley brought a claim for breach of privacy, Mr Justice Eady found 
that there was no public interest justification for the breach of Mr Mosley’s privacy. He also 
found that the decisions to publish the story and the online video were indicative of “casual” 
and “cavalier” editorial judgments. In awarding Mr Mosley £60,000 damages, he noted that 
“no amount of damages can fully compensate the Claimant for the damage done. He is hardly 
exaggerating when he says that his life was ruined.” 100

3.17  A similar example of a casual and cavalier approach to privacy is offered by the handling of the 
diaries of Dr Kate McCann by the NoTW, discussed in detail below.101 In short, the NoTW had 
come into possession of the personal diaries of Dr McCann, via a Portuguese journalist who 
had, himself, acquired them from the Portuguese police. It chose to publish highly personal 
excerpts from the diaries without the consent of Dr McCann. 

3.18  Paragraph  3.8  above  explains  that  Mr  Sanderson,  the  NoTW  journalist  who  acquired  the 
diaries, confirmed to the Inquiry that he applied no consideration of privacy when acquiring 
them. His understanding was that the diaries would not be published without the consent of 
the McCanns; he appeared not to realise that the acquisition of the diaries alone involved a 
substantial breach of Dr McCann’s privacy, even without the intention to publish. 

3.19  The Inquiry heard two conflicting accounts of the approach taken by the NoTW to gaining the 
consent of the McCanns to publish. First, Mr Myler told the Inquiry that he had instructed Mr 
Edmondson to make it clear to the McCann’s PR assistant, Clarence Mitchell, that the NoTW 
had the whole diary and that they were planning to publish extracts of it. He asserted that Mr 
Edmondson led him to believe that this had been done.102 

3.20  Mr Edmondson, by contrast, gave evidence that he had had express instructions from Mr 
Myler to do no such thing.103 Instead, he said he was instructed to have a conversation with 
Mr Mitchell that was ‘woolly’ and ‘ambiguous’. He was told not to reveal that the NoTW had

publication.  This  tactic  of  not  giving  full  disclosure  was  to  avoid  the  McCanns  preventing 
publication by direct approach to Mr Myler, or by seeking an injunction.104 For the reasons I 
set out in greater detail below,105 I accept Mr Edmondson’s account. 

3.21 

It seems clear from these examples that, despite some evidence to the contrary, the NoTW 
was not particularly exercised by issues of privacy, particularly in the context of ‘big’ stories. 
While Mr Crone was able to advise on what approach a court might take, such advice was 
used at least as much to determine strategy for evading legal intervention such as injunctions 
as to inform a principled decision on how to proceed. This is another manifestation of what 
may be identified as a general theme running through the culture, practices and ethics of the 
press, not merely prevalent at the NoTW but also elsewhere: the focus was only on legal risk, 
not on ethical risk (and, one might add, the dictates of ethical journalism) and the rights of 
the individual.

Phone hacking
As explained earlier, it is not the business of this part of the Inquiry to arrive at conclusions on 
what may be described as a high level of granularity in relation to the facts relating to phone 
hacking. Although much, if not all, is likely to emerge during the course of criminal proceedings, 
further or detailed analysis can only be undertaken once the criminal investigation and any 
subsequent prosecutions are complete.

The activities of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and former royal editor of the NoTW, 
Clive Goodman in the period between November 2005 and June 2006 were the subject of 
criminal proceedings in which both pleaded guilty; they were sentenced by Mr Justice Gross 
in January 2007. These proceedings are discussed in detail earlier in the Report.106 

The sentencing of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman set in train a number of civil claims brought 
by victims of alleged phone hacking against News Group Newspapers (NGN) and Mr Mulcaire. 
For example, on hearing of the conviction of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman, the lawyer acting 
for Gordon Taylor, Mark Lewis, believed that information published about Mr Taylor had been 
obtained through illegal methods and advised his client to bring a civil claim. At this time, Mr 
Lewis explained in his evidence that it was believed there was a handful, in the region of 10 
or 12 of victims of phone hacking.107 It is now clear that the numbers of potential victims has 
swelled well beyond this figure. 

4.4 

In her evidence to the Inquiry Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers identified that there 
were potentially 6,349 victims that could be identified from the Mulcaire material, in respect 
of which 4,375 names were linked to phone numbers.108 Of those, 829 people were regarded 
by the police as being likely victims of phone hacking.109

The admissions of the NoTW in the range of civil claims brought in the wake of the convictions 
of Messrs Mulcaire and Goodman are important in establishing the extent of phone hacking 
at the title. On 12 May 2011 NGN admitted liability for the entirety of Sienna Miller’s claim110 
and, through a statement in open court read on 7 June 2011, it accepted that confidential and 
private information had been obtained by the unlawful access of her voicemail messages, 
that confidential and private information had been published as a result, and that there had 
been an invasion of her privacy, breaches of confidence and a campaign of harassment for 
over 12 months.111 NGN accepted that these activities should not have taken place and that 
the articles should not have been published.112

NI has provided to the Inquiry a list of further admissions made in other proceedings: these 
include that Glenn Mulcaire had gained access to voicemails, and in some of the claims it is 
admitted that use was made of confidential information, obtained by accessing voicemails, 
in  published  articles.  Rupert  Murdoch  gave  evidence  that,  in  the  72  civil  cases  that  had 
been settled by 17 April 2012, NGN had assessed whether or not it was likely that voicemail 
interception occurred and accepted liability in principle only where it was appropriate to do 
so.113 

The admissions by NoTW that voicemails have been unlawfully accessed, and the “discovered” 
information subsequently published, is significant. There can be no justification for the conduct 
admitted by NGN Ltd: wholly unsurprisingly, no public interest argument was advanced in any 
of the claims. 

It is probably uncontroversial to state that phone hacking at the NoTW was not limited to 
Clive  Goodman,  but  that  there  were  an  unknown  number  of  others  who  were  involved. 
Some evidence on this matter was given by Paul McMullan, Stuart Hoare and James Hanning. 
As  I  have  already  noted,  Mr  McMullan  was  not  an  attractive  witness  and  was  prone  to 
exaggeration. Furthermore, the evidence given by Mr Hoare and Mr Hanning was hearsay 
evidence  only,  reporting  conversations  with  Stuart  Hoare’s  late  brother  Sean.  In  addition, 
Sean Hoare had suffered from both drug and alcohol addiction problems whilst working for 
the NoTW, and he left the paper under circumstances which were not entirely happy.114 These 
matters have obvious implications for the confidence that can be placed on their evidence. 
However, notwithstanding these considerable caveats, I am prepared to place some weight 
on this evidence, given its consistency with the evidence which has emerged in particular 
from the civil claims, from the MPS, and from victims of phone hacking.

4.9  Mr McMullan described the interception of telephone calls as a device that journalists had 
used for a long time. He said that, before 2000, the use of scanners to intercept conversations 
and obtain stories was widespread among journalists.115 He went on to say that intercepting 
voicemail messages was a ‘school yard trick’ that was in common use among the general 
population.116 He recalled a trade in PIN numbers and said that he had personally swapped

technique of hacking into voicemail messages was ‘not uncommon’ among journalists on the 
NoTW118 although, in fairness to the NoTW but without necessarily accepting it as other 
than unsupported assertion, I should note that he also said that he:119

“...thought the News of the World was one of the least bad offenders. The others were 
much worse.”

4.10 

It is a matter of regret that Mr McMullan went further than was appropriate in his evidence, 
given the need to safeguard any future criminal proceedings and, for obvious legal reasons, 
his assertions of wider knowledge were not further pursued. It is perhaps a true measure and 
reflection on the man that Mr McMullan, alone among the witnesses who had appeared in 
front of the Inquiry, continued to maintain that:120

“...phone hacking is a perfectly acceptable tool, given the sacrifices that we make, if 
all we are trying to do is to get to the truth.” 

4.11  Mr Hoare, giving evidence of conversations he had had with his brother Sean, who died in 
July 2011, said that he had been told by his brother that phone hacking was a daily routine at 
the NoTW and, possibly to a lesser extent, at The Sun. In line with Mr McMullan’s view, Sean 
Hoare told his brother that the practice had been taken to the NoTW from The Sun.121 

4.12  Mr Hanning said Sean Hoare had told him that he himself had hacked phones, on numerous 
occasions, whilst working at the NoTW;122 he gained the impression from his conversations 
with Mr Hoare a number of other employees of NoTW had engaged in phone hacking. Mr 
Hanning related a story told to him by Sean Hoare of a senior executive taking a call from 
a celebrity, who gave him her PA’s phone number in case he needed to get in touch, and 
then passing the number immediately to a colleague so that it could be hacked.123 Another 
example he gave was purchasing the news list (that is to say the list of stories that are to be 
run) from another paper. Mr Hanning said that he had been told that this was a system which 
involved Mr Hoare and a colleague taking £400 in cash from the NoTW, paying £200 to their 
source and keeping £100 each.124 

4.13  Mr Hoare told the Inquiry that his brother had described to him a process whereby a specific 
colleague would be able to obtain the location of a person from their cell phone number.125 
It is speculated that one possible source for this information was the Police Service, although 
in practice it must also be possible that such information might ultimately come from the 
mobile phone operator who has access both to user data and cell site information. 

4.14  Mr Crone confirmed to the Inquiry that he provided advice on the legality of phone hacking in 
2004, but due to legal professional privilege he would not say to whom he gave the advice or in

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFwhat context.126 Without attempting to draw any conclusions about how many journalists or 
executives were engaged in, or aware of, phone hacking, it does seem clear, to use the words 
of Mr Silverleaf QC (albeit also having regard to additional evidence that was not available to 
him in June 2008), that there was “a culture of illegal information access” deployed at NGN 
in order to produce stories for publication. It is inconceivable that this was not symptomatic 
of a broader culture at the paper which regarded the imperative of getting information for 
stories as more important than respecting the rights of any individuals concerned or, indeed, 
compliance with the Editors’ Code or the law. 

Surveillance and the use of private investigators

4.15  There were three private investigators who have been identified as working for, or carrying 
out a significant amount of work for the NoTW. These are Glenn Mulcaire, Derek Webb and 
Steve Whittamore. They had different specialisations. For evident legal reasons this Report 
will  not  look  in  any  detail  at  the  employment  of  Mr  Mulcaire  by  the  NoTW.  Whereas  Mr 
Mulcaire  was  very  much  associated  with  phone  hacking,  Mr  Whittamore’s  metier  was  to 
obtain personal data, such as phone numbers, addresses and vehicle registration details. Mr 
Webb, by contrast, was an expert in surveillance and was used solely for that purpose. The 
Inquiry has not heard evidence of any other individual private investigators working for the 
NoTW  but  cannot  assume  that  there  were  only  three.  Mr  Webb  told  the  Inquiry  that  he 
heard rumours about other private investigators working between 2003 and 2007 but that, 
beyond 2009, he was not aware of any private investigators other than himself working for 
the newspaper.127 

4.16  Mr  Whittamore  provided  services  across  very  many  national  titles,  and  other  media 
organisations,  which  demonstrates  that  the  use  of  private  investigators  to  obtain  access 
to  personal  data  was,  at  least  until  2006,  routine  as  a  journalistic  practice.  According  to 
the  Information  Commissioner’s  report  What  Price  Privacy  Now,  the  ICO  identified  228 
transactions linked to the NoTW, through 23 journalists. This put the NoTW as the 5th highest 
user  of  Mr  Whittamore’s  services  by  volume  of  transactions  and  the  6th  highest  user  by 
number of commissioning journalists.128 

4.17  Mr McMullan told the Inquiry that the use of private investigators was ‘too extensive’. He said 
that in some weeks the NoTW paid Steve Whittamore £4,000.129 Operation Motorman and 
its implications in this context are covered in detail elsewhere in this Report,130 and the issue 
of how the NoTW reacted to the disclosure of Mr Whittamore’s activities is covered later in 
this section. For these purposes it is sufficient to note that use of Mr Whittamore to obtain 
personal data, whether legitimately or otherwise, was routine at least until 2006. No evidence 
has been presented to suggest that the NoTW continued to use private investigators to obtain 
personal data in this way subsequently, in particular after Mr Myler’s arrival as editor.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF4.18 

I turn now to Mr Webb. According to Mr Crone, it was and is a standard part of journalistic 
practice to watch the subjects of stories.131 Mr Webb was recruited to work for the NoTW 
in 2003 by Mr Thurlbeck, whom he had met whilst working as a police officer, in order to 
provide  surveillance  services.132  Mr  Webb  provided  these  services  for  the  NoTW  from  17 
December 2003 until 20 November 2007, and then again from 20 March 2009 until the title 
closed in 2011.133 During that time Mr Webb placed approximately 150 different people under 
surveillance on instructions from the NoTW.134 

4.19  When Mr Webb started working for the NoTW he obtained a private investigator’s licence 
(although that was not required by the paper),135 dubbed himself ‘Silent Shadow’ and invoiced 
the company for each shift worked.136 He was given certain ground rules:137

“They said that I do not go on private land, any private property, do not go hunting 
through rubbish bins and do not take pictures of – photographs of children or follow 
children  connected  to  families.  So  if  the  child  walks  up  the  road,  don’t  follow  the 
child.”

His  instructions  sometimes did  include  following  relations  or contacts of  celebrities,138 for 
instance in the hope that they would lead him to the celebrity in question.139

4.20  Throughout the period that he worked for the NoTW Mr Webb worked full time for them, 
carrying out surveillance on a mix of around 85% celebrities, politicians and sports stars, with 
the remaining 15% being people suspected of drug offences, addictions or crime.140 From the 
work log Mr Webb provided to the Inquiry, it is clear that the majority in the first category 
were  celebrities,  and  most  of  the  instructions  would  be  tips  about  sexual  relationships, 
affairs and intimate relationships.141 Mr Webb was clear that the number and nature of his 
assignments did not change at all in 2007 when Mr Myler took over as editor of the NoTW.142 

4.21  Mr  Thurlbeck,  who  told  the  Inquiry  that  he  had  tasked  Mr  Webb  with  ‘many  dozens  of 
assignments’,143  suggested  the  assignments  were  a  mix  of  investigations  into  intimate 
relationships, drug taking or fraternising with undesirables.144 However, Mr Webb said that 
people suspected of fraternising with criminals formed no part of the surveillance that he 
undertook,145 and the work log provided by Mr Webb indicated that surveillance with a view 
to revealing criminal behaviour was very rare indeed.

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF4.22  Mr Webb was tasked by different journalists working for the news desk who would call or 
email with instructions.146 Mr Thurlbeck told the Inquiry that all the assignments given to Mr 
Webb would be the result of some specific intelligence as “...it was too expensive to go on 
fishing expeditions …. and it’s just not something we would do…..”147 This was confirmed by 
Mr Webb.148 

4.23  Mr Thurlbeck explained that there would be consideration of whether the alleged behaviour 
was worth reporting as being in the public interest before Mr Webb would be tasked. These 
discussions  and  decisions  were  not,  however,  recorded,149  and  Mr  Webb  was  not  himself 
ever involved in any discussion of the public interest which justified the surveillance.150 Mr 
Edmondson explained that, in relation to affairs, the consideration would largely be around 
whether the person was:151

“projecting themselves in media as wholesome, faithful, would never cheat on their 
wife, and then doing something else in private….”

4.24  The ambiguity and subjectivity surrounding the terminology ‘projecting themselves’ should 
of  course  be  noted,  and  in  any  event  Mr  Edmondson  drew  a  distinction  between  how 
carefully these questions were considered before and after Mr Mosley’s successful action 
against the NoTW.152 Mr Webb told the Inquiry that he was never involved in, or told of, any 
public interest considerations. Perusing the work log provided by Mr Webb, it would be very 
surprising indeed if all, or even the majority, of the instances of surveillance of celebrities and 
sports stars (generally in order to reveal intimate relationships) was so justified.

4.25  Although not expressly mentioned in his evidence, it is clear from other evidence the Inquiry 
has received that, in 2007, Mr Myler brought in a new rule strictly limiting the use of private 
detectives.153 Despite this apparent change in policy there appears to have been no immediate 
change of any sort with regard to Mr Webb’s employment: the nature and quantity of his 
work remained the same.154 He did, however, stop working for the NoTW between November 
2007 and January 2009 when he was charged with aiding and abetting misconduct in public 
office. Mr Crone told him that he would have to stop working for the NoTW if he was charged, 
but that he could come back to work if he was acquitted or if the charges were dropped.155

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF4.26 

In the event, the charges were dropped and Mr Webb went back to the NoTW. At that point, 
he was told by Mr Thurlbeck that he would have to make some changes to the arrangements 
for his employment. Specifically, he was asked to change his company name from ‘Shadow 
Watch’ (to which he had changed it earlier from ‘Silent Shadow’) to ‘Derek Webb Media’, he 
was asked to surrender his PI licence (which had, in fact, lapsed while he was not working 
for  the  NoTW)  and  he  was  asked  to  get  himself  an  NUJ  card.  He  complied  with  all  these 
requests.156 Mr Webb was told that these changes were: “in relation to the Clive Goodman 
affair……that they didn’t want to be tied up with private investigators.”157 Mr Webb was clear 
that he had no journalistic experience and that he never wrote an article for the paper. He 
nonetheless was able to acquire an NUJ card.158 

4.27  This process of trying to pretend that Mr Webb was a journalist was a particularly extraordinary 
one. It was quite clear from Mr Webb’s evidence that his role never changed and at no time 
did he consider himself to be doing the work of a journalist. However, clearly some executives 
at the NoTW felt it would be more appropriate for him to appear to be a journalist, hence 
the instructions relayed to him by Mr Thurlbeck. Mr Edmondson said that surveillance was 
something  that  a  journalist  or  photographer  would  be  expected  to  do,159  but  accepted 
that persuading Mr Webb to join the NUJ in order to be able to employ him, despite the 
introduction by Mr Myler of significant restrictions on using private investigators, was ‘just a 
sham’.160 Mr Edmondson further told the Inquiry that Mr Myler, Stuart Kuttner and Mr Crone 
were all aware of this ‘pretence’.161 

4.28  Mr Myler said that he regarded Mr Webb as a private investigator when he became aware 
of  him  in  2007  after  his  arrest.162  Mr  Myler  said  that  once  the  charges  against  Mr  Webb 
had  been  dropped,  Mr  Edmondson  had  approached  him  and  asked  if  he  would  be  more 
comfortable employing Mr Webb if he was a member of the NUJ. Mr Myler agreed, as: “it 
made him more aware of the responsibilities of working for the News of the World.” 163 Mr 
Myler did not suggest that this process made Mr Webb a journalist.164 He was confident that 
appropriate oversight and processes were in place to ensure that Mr Webb was not doing 
anything that was not lawful and legitimate.165 

4.29  Mr Crone, however, told the Inquiry that he thought Mr Webb was a freelance journalist.166 
His evidence on this point may be doubted: Mr Webb’s evidence was that, in 2007, he had 
discussed his criminal charge with Mr Crone in detail and Mr Crone had personally arranged 
the compromise agreement with Mr Webb when he was forced to leave his employment 
because of the charge, which directly related to his activities as a private investigator.167

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF4.30  There were two particular cases of surveillance which stood out from Mr Webb’s evidence: 
both  were  notable  because  they  involved  opponents  or  campaigners  against  the  NoTW’s 
involvement in phone hacking. 

4.31  The first example was the surveillance of Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris, lawyers representing 
claimants in the civil claims brought against NoTW in respect of phone hacking. Mr Webb was 
tasked to follow each lawyer in order to try to discover whether they were having an affair. 
The  surveillance  task  (which  involved,  for  part  of  the  time,  the  surveillance  of  the  wrong 
person) lasted a week.

4.32  The  rationale  for  the  surveillance  of  Ms  Harris  and  Mr  Lewis  was  the  concern,  shared  by 
Julian  Pike  at  Farrers,  solicitors  then  acting  for  NoTW,  and  Mr  Crone,  that  they  were  not 
respecting confidentiality agreements relating to phone hacking settlements and that this 
was detrimental to NGN’s position. They further concluded that the right course of action was 
to try to prevent Ms Harris and Mr Lewis from acting in subsequent cases. One of the tools 
in this campaign was to be surveillance, to identify the nature of the relationship between 
the  two  solicitors  that  might  lend  circumstantial  support  to  the  allegation  that  they  were 
exchanging confidential information.168 Mr Pike said that he was aware that the NoTW had 
put Ms Harris and Mr Lewis under surveillance. He defended the decision to do so, saying 
that he would do the same again in the same circumstances.169 He claimed not to know that 
the surveillance was not being carried out by a journalist.170 

4.33  Mr Crone asserted that he did not commission private investigators to watch Ms Harris and 
Mr Lewis, but instead had agreed that Mr Webb would be asked to “ascertain the nature of 
the relationship” between them.171 Mr Edmondson told the Inquiry that the surveillance of 
Ms Harris made him uncomfortable because it was not something which was likely ever to 
lead to a publishable story.172 He said that he raised this with Mr Crone and that:173

“Tom  Crone’s  response  was  that  he  accepted  that,  namely  that  it  was  unlikely 
material for inclusion in the newspaper as a story, but told me that the main reason 
to investigate was that it could provide the newspaper with good leverage against 
the two individuals.”

4.34  Mr  Crone  continued  to  maintain,  despite  being  the  only  witness  before  the  Inquiry  to 
believe it, that Mr Webb was employed as a freelance journalist,174 though he did accept 
that in undertaking the specific task of surveillance of Mr Lewis and Ms Harris he was ”doing 
something for the legal department.”175

4.35  This whole saga reflects poorly on all involved. The use of covert surveillance against solicitors 
representing  the  opposition  in  damaging  litigation  is  dubious  at  best,  particularly  when  it

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFseems clear that the surveillance was commissioned in order to put pressure on the solicitors 
to withdraw from the litigation. It is a case of attacking the man and not the ball. Mr Crone 
must, ultimately, take final responsibility. Despite his efforts to persuade the Inquiry to the 
contrary, in my judgment he well knew that Mr Webb was not carrying out proper journalistic 
functions. Additionally, it was primarily his decision to engage Mr Webb to conduct discreet 
surveillance of Mr Lewis and Ms Harris in circumstances where there was no conceivable 
journalistic or other justification to do so: this was clearly in breach of their Article 8 rights. 

4.36  The  second  notable  example  of  NoTW  surveillance  is  equally  dubious.  Tom  Watson  MP, 
arguably the most energetic of the anti-hacking MPs, and a member of the Culture Media and 
Sport (CMS) Select Committee was placed under surveillance during the investigation by the 
CMS Committee of phone hacking. As far as Derek Webb was concerned he was asked to try 
to prove an alleged affair (there was no affair).176 The surveillance seems to have been part of 
an orchestrated attempt to put pressure on Mr Watson to step back from the hacking issue. 
Around the same time as the surveillance was commissioned, Lord Mandelson confirmed 
that Rebekah Brooks had asked him for Mr Watson and others on the Select Committee to be 
“pulled off” the hacking issue.177

4.37 

It now appears that Mr Watson may not have been the only member of the Select Committee 
targeted for surveillance. On 3 May 2012, when reviewing Mr Watson’s book,178 Mr Thurlbeck 
(describing what he had told Mr Watson in confidence and which Mr Watson had recorded in 
the book) wrote in the New Statesman:179

“So the public now knows that, at the height of the hacking scandal, News of the 
World  reporters  were  despatched  to  spy  round  the  clock  on  the  members  of  the 
culture, media and sport committee. The objective was to find as much embarrassing 
sleaze on as many members as possible in order to blackmail them into backing off 
from its highly forensic inquiry into phone-hacking.
It  was  a  plan  hatched  not  by  the  News  of  the  World  but  by  several  executives  at 
News  International  –  up  the  corridor  in  “Deepcarpetland”,  as  the  area  staffed  by 
managers and pen-pushers was known. And it failed because the reporters had grave 
reservations, so dithered and procrastinated. It wasn’t journalism, it was corporate 
espionage. Ten days later, the plot was cancelled.”

4.38  Mr Thurlbeck’s article must be treated with some caution. When requiring him to provide a 
statement, the Inquiry made it clear that it wished to be informed about other aspects of the 
culture, practices and ethics at the NoTW and then specifically asked about his awareness of 
the surveillance carried out by Mr Webb (although the question was clearly not limited to 
Mr Webb). His answer was that Mr Webb had been engaged by the majority of the reporters 
on the NoTW (including him) “to undertake what journalists do on all newspapers have been 
doing for more than a century, namely to observe human behaviour and report on it” and 
that, so far as he was aware, Mr Webb had not been instructed to do anything illegal.180 He 
did not provide this obviously extremely significant information (set out in the piece in the 
New Statesman) about the culture and practices within the paper. Neither did he volunteer

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFit when he gave evidence on 12 December 2011. In view of my concern about the way in 
which this account emerged, I make no finding about it; if true, however, it reveals a very 
disturbing state of affairs and is suggestive of an ‘untouchable’ mentality. I share the concern 
expressed  by  the  CMS  Select  Committee  about  the  fact  that  NI  was  undertaking  discreet 
surveillance of members of that Committee, a matter for which Mr James Murdoch has quite 
rightly fulsomely apologised.181

4.39 

I do not pass direct comment on the other assignments Mr Webb undertook between 2007 
and 2011, save to note that any public interest justification for the surveillance of the many 
celebrities and sports stars contained in Mr Webb’s work log is likely to have been extremely 
thin in the vast majority of cases. It appears more likely that covert surveillance, like phone 
hacking, was considered by some within the NoTW to be an ordinary technique for news 
gathering,  rather  than  an  exceptional  technique  to  be  used  where  justified  by  the  public 
interest in the underlying story. 

4.40 

Persuasion and harassment
It is a fact of life that not everybody is always keen to cooperate with the press, particularly 
when details of their own private lives or the private lives of their friends or family are involved. 
Journalists have therefore developed methods of persuading them to talk. A specific example 
arises in relation to the NoTW and has already been touched on. This relates to the approach 
of Mr Thurlbeck to the women involved in the Max Mosley case. The facts of the matter are 
that, following publication of the original story on 30 March 2008, Mr Thurlbeck sent emails 
to two of the women involved in the story in the following terms:182

“Hope you’re well. I’m Neville Thurlbeck, the chief reporter of the News of the World, 
the journalist who wrote the story about Max Mosley’s party with you and your girls 
on Friday. Please take a breath before you get angry with me! I did ensure that all 
your faces were blocked out to spare you any grief and soon the story will become 
history, as life and the news agenda move on very quickly. There is a substantial sum 
of money available to you or any of the girls in return for an exclusive interview with 
us. The interview can be done anonymously and your face can be blacked out too. So 
it’s pretty straightforward. Shall we meet/talk?”

4.41  The following day he sent the two women another email:183

“I’m just about to send you a series of pictures which will form the basis of our article 
this week. We want to reveal the identities of the girls involved in the orgy with Max, 
as this is the only follow up we have to the story. Our preferred story, however, would 
be you speaking to us directly about your dealings with Max and for that we would 
be extremely grateful. In return for this, we would grant you full anonymity, pixelate 
your faces in all photographs and secure a substantial sum of money for you. This 
puts you firmly in the driving seat and allows you much greater control ...”

4.42  As is clear, the women in question were given Hobson’s choice: cooperate with the NoTW or 

face public humiliation.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF4.43  Mr Thurlbeck gave evidence that, although his name was on these emails, they were dictated 
to  him184  by  Ian  Edmondson.185  He  was  seemingly  reluctant  to  name  Mr  Edmondson  (he 
initially  described  him  as  a  man  on  the  news  desk;  Mr  Edmondson  was  in  fact  the  news 
editor) and agreed that he had given this account before Mr Justice Eady in the civil case 
brought by Mr Mosley. Mr Edmondson, on the other hand, said that he had no memory of 
the emails, or of emails of that nature being sent. He said they were drafted in language he 
would not use.186 Mr Edmondson’s evidence was somewhat equivocal. He was clear that he 
would have expected an approach to be made to the two women seeking their cooperation 
in a follow-up article. However, he asserted that he would not, in any circumstances, have 
allied himself with this type of approach to any witness.187

4.44 

In truth, it does not matter which account is accurate. If either Mr Thurlbeck or Mr Edmondson 
was concerned about what was happening, that itself should have triggered some mechanism 
for review. This was not some small story on one of the back pages: what was being discussed 
was going to affect people’s lives. Mr Thurlbeck concedes that they were sent by him, in his 
name and willingly.188 It follows, therefore, that Mr Thurlbeck must accept responsibility for 
them and not merely as the cipher for someone else. He was after all the chief reporter at the 
paper and a journalist of very considerable experience.

4.45  As I have already observed, in his judgment in the Mosley case, Mr Justice Eady likened the 
emails to blackmail. He commented on Mr Thurlbeck’s inability to see that point and cited 
the following cross examination from the trial:189

“Q  Let’s be direct about this. There is a clear threat here that if they don’t cooperate 
they will expose them in the News of the World?
A  No,  I  don’t  accept  that.  I  think  there  was  a  clear  choice  here  but  there  was  no 
attempt to threaten them.
...
Q  Let’s get this straight. If the blackmailer says to the victim, ‘Either you pay up or I’ll 
put your picture in the newspaper’ he’s offering him a very fair choice?
A  No.
Q  There’s no threat?
A  No, because I’m asking for something here. Your example states that I’m asking for 
something in return for issuing a threat.
Q  Yes, indeed you are.
A  No, I’m offering to give them something. I’m offering to pay them money for an 
anonymous interview. I’m offering to pay them, not to take anything from them, so in 
that sense I’m not blackmailing them at all. That thought never crossed my mind. I’m 
offering them a choice.”

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF4.46 

In his evidence to the Inquiry, it seemed that Mr Thurlbeck still could not see the point and 
was untroubled that a High Court judge took a different view to his. Further, he appeared to 
suggest that all others at the NoTW shared his view. He said:190

“The  point  that  Mr  Justice  Eady  makes  is  that  it  could  be  interpreted  as  being 
blackmail.  I  don’t  interpret  it  that  way,  and  we  didn’t  at  the  News  of  the  World. 
Nobody at the News of the World – nobody, from the editor down – has discussed or 
accused me of blackmailing these girls. Now, if I had, I would have expected Mr Myler, 
who was a very fair-minded man, to have reprimanded me severely. We didn’t have 
a conversation about it because it simply was not the case.”

4.47  Mr Thurlbeck further explained that this was normal practice:191

“People  would  often  be  reluctant  to  help  a  newspaper  because  of  their  identities 
coming  out,  and  often  deals  would  be  done  to  protect  their  identities.  We  would 
say, “Look, if you talk to us anonymously, then we can write a story about this.” This 
happens all the time. [….] This is the course of a normal journalistic practice, if you 
like, offering people a degree of anonymity in return for evidence that could support 
a story.” 

4.48  To the CMS Select Committee in 2009, Mr Crone denied both that Mr Thurlbeck’s behaviour 
could constitute blackmail and that the judge had considered that it might do so.192 Despite Mr 
Crone’s approach in front of the Committee, he took a different line when he gave evidence to 
the Inquiry. When asked if he accepted that the emails amounted to blackmail he replied:193

“They were pretty close, I think.”

4.49  Mr Myler accepted, both in the High Court and to the Inquiry, that he could see that the 
emails probably could not be interpreted other than as a threat and that he was surprised 
by them.194 Mr Justice Eady concluded from the failure of Mr Myler to take any disciplinary 
action at all against Mr Thurlbeck that:195

“it would appear that Mr Myler did not consider there was anything at all objectionable 
about Mr Thurlbeck’s approach to the two women, as he did not query it at any stage. 
This discloses a remarkable state of affairs.”

4.50  Mr Myler accepted this criticism.196 He contradicted Mr Thurlbeck’s assertion that no one 
had discussed the matter with him, saying that he had, in fact, admonished Mr Thurlbeck197 
and, by implication, had also raised the issue with Mr Edmondson,198 making it clear that 
‘care needed to be taken.’ He told the Inquiry that writing in that way was ‘unnecessary’ and

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF‘totally inappropriate’.199 Mr Edmondson told the Inquiry that, on reading the emails now, he 
thought they were a threat.200 

4.51 

I observe that Mr Myler’s evidence to the Inquiry is inconsistent with his evidence to Mr 
Justice Eady,201 to the effect that he did not at any stage raise any concerns with Mr Thurlbeck. 
It  is  likely  that  what  he  said  to  Mr  Justice  Eady  (when  the  relevant  matters  were  fresh  in 
his mind) was correct but, again, the importance of this episode is what it says about the 
culture at the NoTW, the practice of journalism at the paper and the lack of attention paid 
to the rights of those who not merely might be affected but undoubtedly would be seriously 
affected by what was published. 

4.52  Rupert Murdoch’s evidence on this issue was also revealing. Although he made it clear that 
at the time of giving his evidence he had not acquainted himself with the detail of Mr Justice 
Eady’s judgment, Mr Murdoch’s initial reaction to the judge’s assessment was:202

‘No, it’s not my position at all. I respect him and I accept what he says, I’m just simply 
saying that a journalist doing a favour for someone in returning [sic] for a favour back 
is pretty much everyday practice.’

When probed on this issue he claimed ‘I don’t know if she was offered money but it happens’, 
and subsequently said:203

“And I may well agree with every word if I read it [i.e. the judgment of Eady J]. But it’s 
a common thing in life, way beyond journalism, for people to say, “I’ll scratch your 
back if you scratch my back.”

4.53  Mr  Murdoch  did  go  away  and  read  the  judgment;  he  subsequently  wrote  to  the  Inquiry 
clarifying his evidence on this issue and explaining that it was not his intention to appear to 
take issue with the judge’s conclusions. However, although Mr Murdoch would no doubt not 
wish to countenance the deployment of tactics tantamount to blackmail, his more general 
observations about the doing of favours and back-scratching are extremely revealing as to 
the culture, practices and ethics of the press more generally, and far more so than simply in 
the circumstances which he was then discussing. It is also revealing that the judgment of Mr 
Justice Eady had not been brought to Mr Murdoch’s attention prior to his giving evidence to 
the Inquiry, or that he had chosen not to read it. It was, after all, a judgment in which the 
NoTW had been found to be guilty not only of practices tantamount to blackmail, but also 
of casual and cavalier journalism. It was costly for the NoTW and, according to many of the 
NoTW witnesses, it had led to a change in approach to privacy generally. That Mr Murdoch 
was not apparently familiar with it says something about the degree to which his organisation 
engages with the ethical direction of its newspapers. 

4.54  From the foregoing, it is difficult to reach any other conclusion than that Mr Thurlbeck, and 
possibly Mr Edmondson, regarded the approach taken in these emails as an entirely standard 
way to behave. Mr Thurlbeck was supported in this view by the complete lack of negative 
feedback from Mr Myler or any other senior colleague. The apparent change of heart of both 
Mr Myler and Mr Crone is noted, but the volte face comes far too late. On this basis, it seems

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFentirely probable that the approach taken in these emails was not so very unusual, that the 
attitude was condoned within the NoTW and that subsequent retractions have been driven 
as much by the public exposure of the tactic as by any genuine belief that such an approach 
was inappropriate. The conclusion of the CMS Committee on this point bears repeating:204

“A culture in which the threats made to Women A and B could be seen as defensible 
is to be deplored. The fact that News of the World executives still do not fully accept 
the inappropriateness of what took place is extremely worrying.” 

4.55  The example of the emails sent to the women in the Mosley case is an extreme instance of a 

technique described by the actor and comedian, Steve Coogan:205

“The technique they often use is – these women are often vulnerable and not canny 
enough to understand the techniques of the press, and I know anecdotally that they 
– what they do is they say, “We’re going to run a story about you. It’s going to be 
very unsympathetic. We’re going to make you look tawdry.” They say this to the girl, 
“We’re going to make you look tawdry and awful and sluttish, but if you talk to us, 
you can make the story all positive and friendly and nice and we’ll make you look 
lovely and we’ll give you some money as well.” 

4.56  Mr Coogan was himself treated in a similar way. He was called by a journalist from the NoTW 
and told that, if he would confirm certain aspects of a story, in return the journalist would 
guarantee that the more lurid details would be omitted.206 In the event, Mr Coogan confirmed 
the story, and the NoTW in turn proceeded to publish the whole story, including the lurid 
details they had promised not to print. Mr Coogan indicated that this was not the action of 
a rogue reporter, but had been sanctioned, or even organised, by the subsequent editor, Mr 
Coulson.207 

4.57 

In a rather different twist, Mr Driscoll told the Inquiry what happened in relation to the case 
of the medical records of a Premier League football manager, where information obtained 
by blagging was not used in a published story but was instead used to put pressure on the 
individual to cooperate with the paper on subsequent stories. Mr Driscoll said:208

“I know there was a phone call to that football manager to tell him exactly what we 
knew and that he was very upset about it, and he made his thoughts known about 
that and said that there was no way he wanted that story to appear in public. And 
this is another technique on the News of the World, if you want to call it a technique, 
that information is a tradable commodity, and it was put to [blank] that we wouldn’t 
use this information and in the end it was mentioned to him that we would  keep 
it quiet and we would keep it out the public domain, and because of that, he then 
started cooperating with the paper.”

4.58  Given that the information appears to have been accessed unlawfully, and its publication is 
likely to have been an actionable misuse of private information, the fact that the newspaper 
sought  to  bargain  with  the  private  medical  information  reveals  a  remarkable  degree  of

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFaudacity and a disregard for both the privacy of the individual and the confidentiality of the 
information. 

Deceit

4.59  Evidence  to  the  Inquiry  has  revealed  that  it  was  absolutely  standard  practice  across  the 
industry, and certainly within the NoTW, to record all conversations without telling people 
that they were being recorded.209 A number of witnesses gave evidence that it was standard 
practice at NoTW to make tape recordings of any conversations with sources.210 Mr Thurlbeck 
said:211

““you would have to equip yourself, obviously, with recording devices to record their 
admissions and write about it in the newspaper without fear of being sued for libel.” 

Mr Edmondson argued that this was entirely proper because people might otherwise not 
speak frankly.212 The implication seemed to be that people may not be prepared to go so far, 
knowing that they were being recorded, as they would if they did not know. Whilst there 
may not be anything wrong with this practice (and a true record of what was said can have 
very real value), it does at least raise questions about trust between journalists and their 
sources  (and  in  instances  where  the  recording  is  not  of  a  conversation  with  a  source  but 
someone like Clarence Mitchell the questions arise all the more acutely). Suffice to say, there 
are circumstances in which it might be considered to be low level deceit.

4.60 

It is not entirely clear that this is a practice permitted by the Editors’ Code. Paragraph 10 of 
the Code states: 

“i)  The  press  must  not  seek  to  obtain  or  publish  material  acquired  by  using 
hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or 
mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of 
documents or photographs; or by accessing digitally-held private information 
without consent.

ii)  Engaging 

in  misrepresentation  or  subterfuge, 

including  by  agents  or 
intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then 
only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.”

4.61  The first limb of paragraph 10 appears primarily to relate to interception of a communication 
that does not otherwise involve the journalist, although this is not explicit. The second limb is 
more about a failure on the part of the journalist to be honest with those he or she is dealing 
with. In this context it is, at least, arguable that recording conversations without notifying the 
other party is a form of subterfuge. At any rate, it is not unreasonable to suppose that some 
consideration as to whether it is appropriate to do so should be undertaken in each case, 
rather than the routine recording of people without their knowledge or permission.

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF4.62  This practice of covert recording sometimes goes further. An example is the video recording 
that Mr Thurlbeck persuaded his source to make of Mr Mosley. He explained that this was 
done for legal reasons:213

“It  was  important  for  Michelle  to  video  the  orgy  to  ensure  that  we  had  sufficient 
evidence should Mr Mosley threaten to sue the News of the World for libel.” 

But the NoTW did not simply put the recording in a cupboard until it was needed for the 
inevitable libel or privacy case. Instead, they put it on their website, leading to some of the 
privacy issues discussed above. 

Blagging

4.63  Another technique that qualifies as deceit is what has been called ‘blagging’. Mr McMullan 

described the process of blagging on these terms:214

“A blag might be: “Hello, I am Mr X’s accountant, could you please fax the bill”, and 
then you get a list of all the phone numbers that he’s just rung and then you ring them 
all up and you find the mistress he’s just rung.” 

4.64  Mr  McMullan  was  clear  that  his  belief  was  that  this  sort  of  activity  was  common  at  the 

NoTW.215 He explained why:216

“It’s very hard to get a story. You just don’t go up to a paedophile priest and say, 
“Hello, good sermon, and are you a priest because you like abusing choir boys?” It 
doesn’t happen. You don’t say, “Hello, I work for the News of the World.” You have to 
go to the nth degree to get to the truth.”

Mr McMullan provided a specific example of a blag in which he was involved, securing access 
to a database of convicted paedophiles under false pretences and:217

“basically plundered about 50 paedophiles who had raped and abused children and 
had served a sentence.”

4.65  The circumstances described by Mr McMullan – blagging in order to uncover a paedophile 
ring – could be an example of investigative journalism in the public interest, depending on 
whose the database it was: blagging the information from the police or, for example, the 
probation service, in order to ‘name and shame’ raises different issues. Given that s55 of 
the Data Protection Act 1998 contains a public interest defence, some kind of blags are likely 
to be both lawful and compliant with ethical codes, provided there is sufficient prima facie 
evidence to justify the blag in the first place. 

4.66 

It  is  important  to  underline  that  I  am  not  suggesting  that  deception  is  not  a  potentially 
legitimate tool within the armoury of a journalist: it will all depend on the circumstances. 
The concern will always be the circumstances in which and the purposes for which the deceit

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFis used. There is a real public interest in exposing crime or serious impropriety, protecting 
public health and safety and, depending on the circumstances, preventing the public from 
being  misled.  In  those  cases,  journalists  may  well  have  to  be  devious  to  obtain  the  story 
and nobody is likely to criticise them for behaving in that way. The issue is the abuse of that 
technique simply in order to pursue stories or people without any public interest justification 
of any sort. 

4.67  The  evidence  from  Operation  Motorman,218  challenges  the  suggestion  that  blagging  was 
used, in the majority of cases, in the public interest. To the contrary, there is clear prima facie 
evidence that there was no public interest in much of the information that many of the blags 
obtained. 

4.68  At the NoTW blagging was not only used to get material that would eventually form the basis 
of a published story. Blagging was also used as a technique to obtain the codes required to 
engage in other forms of illicit access to information. Mr McMullan, when asked if he had 
paid officials at phone companies, said:219

“The people we employed were more into blagging to try and trick people out of their 
PIN codes and that kind of thing, rather than actually paying someone who worked 
at Vodafone or whatever.” 

4.69  Another example was given by Mr Driscoll, who described failing to track down details of 
the  medical  condition  of  a  prominent  football  manager  by  ‘old-fashioned  means’,  to  be 
subsequently called by his sports editor and told: “the story is true. I have his medical records 
with  me  at  the  moment.”220  Mr  Driscoll  described  what  he  had  been  told  about  how  the 
medical records were obtained:221

“I was told it’s through a blagging technique. I was told that will sometimes you’d 
get a situation where – if an investigator sent a fax to a GP or a hospital saying, “I’m 
his specialist, I need these details”, it was incredible how many times that would just 
get sent straight back. There were different techniques to obtain them and I was told 
they weren’t obtained through any illegal source but it was from through blagging 
at the time.”

4.70  Mr Driscoll said that this blagging was not done by the news editor himself, but that:222

‘there were specialist people on the News of The World who did that sort of stuff……
special people on the news desk or features desk that he went to.”

4.71  Mr  Driscoll  said  that  he  was  not  personally  happy  with  using  blagging  of  this  sort  to  get 
information,223 but he did not raise these concerns with the sports editor or any other senior 
executive at the paper because he was afraid it would damage his career:224

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF“it would be a very brave journalist, certainly in the early years of his career on the 
paper, to suddenly say, “I’m not happy with these techniques that are being used.” 
You’d be basically making a decision over your career there. Anyone on that floor who 
complained too much would find themselves pushed out, certainly.”

4.72  Mr Driscoll also provided another example when he was told that someone had persuaded 
the Football Association into revealing information about a drugs test by pretending to be 
from the football club of the individual concerned. This, he said, was a story which he had 
obtained from various sources, but it was the blagging phone call that satisfied the legal team 
that the story was true and therefore safe to print.225 He suggested that this imperative to 
ensure that a story was true before publishing it was generally the reason for resorting to 
such techniques.226 

4.73  Mr Driscoll asserted that this was common practice at the NoTW and widely accepted by his 
colleagues.227 However, despite this assertion, he was clear that the two examples of blagging 
set out here were the only two of which he had personal knowledge during the years that he 
worked at NoTW.228 

4.74  Mr Myler, Mr Wallis and Mr Thurlbeck all rejected Mr McMullan’s evidence on the widespread 
use and appropriateness of blagging, and indeed most of Mr McMullan’s evidence generally, 
saying that he painted a picture of the NoTW that they did not recognise.229 Mr Thurlbeck 
said:230

“My  experience  of  the  News  of  the  World  is  that  it  was  a  highly  professional 
organisation.  It  was  staffed  by  some  of  the  best  journalists  on  Fleet  Street,  who 
worked with great diligence and integrity, and continue to do so. I don’t – I was proud 
to work alongside all of my colleagues. I have enormous respect for all of them. You 
know, there may have been a small caucus of people who gave us a bad reputation 
now.”

4.75 

I come to no conclusion as to the size of the ‘caucus of people’ who were responsible for the 
unethical practices identified in this Chapter, including blagging. However, I do conclude that 
blagging was utilised at the NoTW as a means to access private information, either by using 
third parties or by journalists themselves.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFthe result ‘investigative journalism’, regardless of whether that label is strictly merited. The 
Inquiry heard evidence from Mr Mahmood who carried out many hundreds of investigations 
whilst working for the NoTW and other titles. Mr Mahmood told the Inquiry that, before he 
embarked on an investigation, he would provide senior and legal staff with justification as to 
why the story was in the public interest and why any subterfuge was justified.231 The specific 
methods to be used were discussed with the legal team and he would stay in constant touch 
with them during an investigation.232 He explained that the approach at the NoTW was much 
more informal than he had been used to when working for The Sunday Times. There were, for 
example, no formal meetings or discussions, but nonetheless everything was discussed with 
Mr Crone.233 Mr Mahmood gave evidence that, “we were extra cautious to comply with the 
PCC Code,” and that there was keen scrutiny of whether a proposal for the use of subterfuge 
would pass the public interest test. The key factors they would take into account were the 
exposure  of  criminality,  or  moral  wrongdoing  or  of  hypocrisy234  and  whether  it  would  be 
possible to obtain the same information without using subterfuge.235

Disguise

5.2  Mr Mahmood described situations in which he had masqueraded in many guises in order 
to obtain information for stories. In some cases, for example, he had posed as a client for 
prostitutes in order to secure evidence of drug dealing:236

“They were dealing drugs to clients. I mean, sure, the only way to infiltrate them was 
to pose as a client and then the offer would be made to us.”

On another well known occasion Mr Mahmood posed as a Sheikh, Mohammed al Kareem, 
in order to get his target to ‘relax’ and ‘be himself’.237 The purpose of taking on these fake 
personalities was to make an offer for, or wait to be offered, illegal substances or to show a 
willingness to undertake unlawful or immoral actions in order to expose the commission of 
illegality. 

Inducements
The NoTW did pay for information. Mr Mahmood said:238

5.3 

“We  advertised  it.  I  don’t  think  there’s  anything  wrong  with  that,  as  long  as  the 
individuals  are  not  profiting  from  their  crimes  by  doing  so.  I  mean,  if  they  were 
whistle-blowing and helping us expose drug rings and paedophile rings and expecting 
a fee for that, then I see nothing wrong with that.”

527

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFThe issues surrounding payment for information are dealt with in detail later in this report.239 In 
seeking to understand the culture of the NoTW it is sufficient to note that this was considered 
a standard practice.

5.4  Mr Mahmood was reluctant to explain his modus operandi to the Inquiry240 but it was clear 
that in many cases it involved offering the target some inducement to commit the act that 
he was seeking to expose. Mr Mahmood pointed out that, in the Fake Sheikh case, judges 
both in the UK and at the European Court of Justice had ruled that there was no entrapment. 
He was keen to emphasise that, in his opinion, he did not entrap people. He went further, 
asserting that he did not believe that it was possible to ensnare normally law-abiding people 
into behaving in an illegal fashion;241 he also said that the number of successful prosecutions 
following on from his stories was testament to the fact that his methods had been tested and 
considered appropriate time and again by the courts.242

5.5 

Entrapment by a journalist is not ordinarily a defence to the commission of a crime. There 
are, however, ethical questions here as to the circumstances and extent to which it is right to 
encourage or entice someone into the commission of an offence that they would otherwise 
not have committed, at least on that specific occasion. Witnesses such as Alastair Campbell 
have  drawn  attention  to  this  question,  and  have  criticised  Mr  Mahmood  for  his  modus 
operandi.243 

5.6  Mr Mahmood was clear that there were circumstances in which he considered it ethical to 
break the law in order to get a story in the public interest. He used the example of purchasing 
child pornography in a case that led to the conviction of the supplier. He stressed that the 
overriding factor was the public interest and that he had never yet been prosecuted for drugs 
or other offences relating to work that he had done.244 When pressed on whether there was 
a level of criminal behaviour to which he would not go in order to expose criminality, he 
indicated that he would not go out and rob a bank just to show that banks could be robbed.245 

6.	 Approach	to	compliance

6.1 

Responsibility and accountability for compliance
The Inquiry was told by many witnesses that the editor was responsible for everything that 
happened at his or her newspaper, although they would not necessarily be aware of all that 
was going on. This was no different at the NoTW. However, there was very little clarity about 
who  was  responsible  in  practical  day-to-day  terms  for  compliance  with  legal  and  ethical 
requirements.  Whilst  individual  journalists  were  clearly  required  by  their  employment 
contracts to comply with the terms of the Editors’ Code, and to comply with other company 
policies  and  procedures,  it  has  not  been  possible  to  ascertain  who,  if  anyone,  had  senior 
responsibility for ensuring legal and ethical compliance within the organisation.

528

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF6.2  Mr Crone, the legal manager at News Group Newspapers (NGN), told the Inquiry that he had 
no role in ensuring ethical (or, it would appear, even legal) behaviour within the company:246

“I’m not a guardian of ethics, really…..my job was really to advise on legal risk, the 
law relating to a particular situation that the newspaper was in or was thinking of 
getting in.” 

When pressed on the point he said, “I don’t know who would be identified as the person 
most involved with compliance and ethics.”247 Mr Crone suggested that corporate compliance 
might be the responsibility of the Company Secretary248 or the Chief Executive.249 

In fact, Mr Chapman, the Company Secretary, told the Inquiry that his compliance function 
“would have related to the commercial side of the business”. He differentiated this from the 
editorial function and said it was limited to commercial and business support functions such 
as  HR,  production,  advertising  and  marketing.250  Mr  Chapman  felt  that  responsibility  for 
compliance on the editorial side of the business would sit with the editorial legal team; in 
other words, with Mr Crone.251 

Despite Mr Crone’s claim that ethical compliance might be a matter for Mr Chapman, when he 
became aware of serious ethical and legal lapses through his involvement in the legal challenge 
by Gordon Taylor, Mr Crone took only limited steps to alert those within the organisation who 
one might think should have been responsible for dealing with them. In particular, he said 
that he did not discuss the concerns about a ‘culture of illegal access to information’ with Mr 
Chapman. As has already been discussed above,252 Mr Crone told the Inquiry that he did think 
that James Murdoch, the Chief Executive, was made aware of the situation in the Gordon 
Taylor case, including all ‘seriously relevant’ parts of the opinion provided by Mr Silverleaf 
QC.253 He appeared to think that this represented bringing the matter to the attention of the 
right person. 

James Murdoch told the Inquiry that governance was for the editor254 (at this time Mr Myler). 
He said that he had sought, and was given, assurances that extensive training and procedures 
had been put in place and that the NoTW had been thoroughly investigated with respect to 
phone hacking, that no new evidence had been found and that the police had closed their 
case.255 For his part, Mr Myler accepted ultimate responsibility for governance at the paper 
but said that he sought to instil:256

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF“a culture of individual and collective responsibility for ensuring compliance with the 
PCC code and the law.”

6.6  Mr Myler was editor of the NoTW from February 2007 until July 2011. Although he drew 
some  distinction  between  the  culture  in  place  at  the  newspaper  before  his  arrival  and 
that which he sought to deliver, he also argued that there were protocols and systems in 
place before he arrived and that “the members of senior staff clearly understood their roles 
and responsibilities.257 James Murdoch similarly took the view that there were senior legal 
managers in post who had a lot of experience,258 and that the oversight structures in place 
(Management  Boards  and  audit  processes)  should  have  been  sufficient  to  ensure  good 
governance.259 

6.7 

6.8 

6.9 

Rupert Murdoch, having told the Inquiry that it was his clear understanding from Les Hinton, 
former Executive Chairman of NI, that Mr Myler had been put in place to find out “what the 
hell was going on”,260 appears to have made no effort to follow up the matter directly. He told 
the Inquiry that he took no steps to see whether Mr Myler was discharging his brief as he 
relied on Mr Hinton to oversee the process.261 Rupert Murdoch said that Mr Myler:262

“never reported back that there was more hacking than we’d been told.” 

The Inquiry is not in a position to allocate responsibility (or blame) as between these senior 
individuals. What is abundantly clear from the review of relevant events more fully covered 
above263 is that the processes and people in place at the NoTW were not sufficient to ensure 
good governance. On the basis of the admissions made in the civil claims alone it is clear that 
the newsroom at the NoTW had, to use Mr Crone’s words, ‘lost its way’ 264 at least with regard 
to phone hacking. 

Data protection – Operation Motorman
As might be expected, the NoTW was clearly aware that the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) 
was relevant to them. Specifically, the Inquiry heard that Mr Crone was once asked to put 
together a note on what the law of data protection meant in relation to working journalists, 
and did so. He did not, however, remember offering advice on the matter on a regular or 
ongoing basis,265 although he did think that there might have been legal courses and other 
journalistic courses where data protection issues were addressed.266

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF6.10  The essential narrative of Operation Motorman is set out above,267 and need not be repeated 
here. The NoTW, in common with the rest of the newspaper industry, does not appear to 
have recognised these events as having any significance for its own processes, despite the 
clear implication that members of its staff might, to put it at its lowest, have been engaging 
Mr Whittamore to undertake unlawful activities. 

6.11  Mr  Crone  accepted  that  he  was  aware  of  the  arrest  of  Mr  Whittamore  and  the  fact  that 
some  of  the  latter’s  customers  were  NI  employees,  but  confirmed  that  he  had  not  been 
asked to provide any advice on the DPA in relation to Operation Motorman.268 Further, there 
was  no  formal  investigation  of  the  allegations  coming  out  of  Operation  Motorman.269  Mr 
Myler, who arrived at the NoTW in 2007, explained that there was a NI policy in place that 
required compliance with data protection law and that as far as he knew it was complied with 
throughout his tenure as editor.270 Mr Pike, the solicitor acting for NI, accepted that he was 
aware of the Operation Motorman material in 2008 and the implication that it pointed to a 
wider use of illegal methods of collecting stories within the NoTW, which could support the 
case being made by Mr Taylor.271 

6.12  This is all in line with the approach more widely taken by national newspapers, that Operation 
Motorman raised no particularly pressing questions for the newspaper industry, or individual 
titles, to address. In one respect therefore, the NoTW is subject to the same criticism applicable 
to other titles: the evidence emerging from Operation Motorman and from the ICO’s reports 
demanded  action,  but  the  evidence  suggests  that  almost  nothing  was  done  in  response. 
However, the NoTW is subject to specific criticism as well. The arrests of Mr Goodman and 
Mr Mulcaire in August 2006 came after the Operation Motorman revelations and between 
the ICO’s publication of What Price Privacy? and What Price Privacy Now? Their arrests and 
subsequent convictions need to be seen in that context. A responsible title exercising effective 
governance would have questioned the credibility of the ‘one rogue reporter’ thesis in light 
of the ICO’s evidence of a widespread and unlawful trade in private information, and would 
have demanded proper investigations into compliance with legal and ethical standards by its 
journalists. 

Accuracy

6.13  The PCC Editors’ Code requires the press to “take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading 
or  distorted  information”.  Most  complaints  to  the  PCC  are  about  alleged  breaches  of  this 
provision.

6.14  Mr Driscoll was clear that stories were not fabricated at the NoTW. He said: “Any suggestion 
of that, I think, is absolutely crazy because, you know, as I said, the litigation would be too 
severe. It would cost too much money.” 272

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF6.15  Mr Wootton explained that he would very rarely run stories without getting confirmation of 
their truth by notifying either the celebrity or his or her agent. Sometimes that would not 
be necessary because the story was already in the public domain. On very rare occasions he 
was requested by the editor or a senior executive not to put a call in.273 In these situations 
the decision not to provide a right of reply would normally be to avoid the risk of leaks.274 Mr 
Wootton said that in his experience a right of reply would only not be given if the newspaper 
or the editor was 100 per cent certain of the truth of a story.275 

6.16  This  emphasis  on  accuracy  as  an  essential  protection  against  libel  action  was  echoed  by 
evidence given by many witnesses to the Inquiry and it is clear that there is a serious legal 
imperative to get the facts right when the material to be published might be thought to be 
defamatory. However, it is far from clear that a similar passion for accuracy applies in respect 
of material that is unlikely to have legal ramifications if it is wrong. This issue is considered in 
more detail further on in the report.276

6.17  Once again, the Max Mosley story provides an admirable example of this issue. Mr Thurlbeck 
was criticised in Mr Justice Eady’s judgment in relation to the preparation of a statement 
by the woman who provided the information about the party. Mr Thurlbeck had prepared 
a statement for her to sign, drawn from the many conversations she had had with him. She 
signed  this  statement  without  amendments  but  Mr  Thurlbeck  later  amended  it  himself, 
without  seeking  a  further  signature  from  the  woman,  and  used  parts  of  the  amended 
statement in the story. Mr Justice Eady doubted Mr Thurlbeck’s evidence on this issue.277 Mr 
Thurlbeck defended his actions on the grounds that:278

“Mr Justice Eady is entitled to his opinion, but my – all I would say is this, in defence 
of this particular story: we were absolutely certain we got the facts right and nobody 
has come forward to show me that what I said had happened did not happen...”

6.18  Mr Thurlbeck is, of course, entitled personally to disagree with the conclusions of the court, 
but I repeat that the NoTW chose not to appeal the decision. Amending a signed statement 
and deploying it as the statement affirmed by the witness without making clear the fact that 
it had been changed takes a measure of justification; it is further illuminating that, by the 
time he gave evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Thurlbeck still had not adjusted his approach to 
issues on which the court had reached clear conclusions.

6.19  The  attribution  of  stories  to  individual  journalists  was  another  area  where  a  degree  of 

inaccuracy seemed acceptable. Mr Wootton told the Inquiry that:279

“Where a desk head wrote a story, it was convention that the article would appear 
under another reporter’s name. However, in such circumstances, it could be that the 
first you knew of the article appearing under your name would be when you opened 
the paper and read it on a Sunday morning.”

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicF6.20  Mr  Wootton  said  that  although  this  was  standard  practice  across  newspapers,  it  did  not 
happen very often and was always seen as positive thing for the journalist who was ‘gifted’ 
the article.280 Conversely, it was also usual practice to put Mr Wootton’s byline on his column 
even on those occasions when it had been written by someone else because he had been 
away.281

Financial controls

6.21  A key aspect of corporate governance and compliance is financial control. There are three 
elements to consideration of this issue. First, the understanding of financial delegation and 
spending limits; secondly, controls on cash; and thirdly, the attitude to claiming of expenses.

Spending limits

6.22  The Inquiry has been provided with little specific evidence relating to the financial delegation 
arrangements at the NoTW, but there is one point that appears worthy of note. Mr Crone 
told the Inquiry that he had delegated spending authority of £5,000. However, he routinely 
settled cases for more than £5,000 without any concerns arising, though he would usually 
consult the editor before doing so.282 Despite the formal £5,000 limit, Mr Crone was unable 
to give a view on whether he had actual authority to offer a settlement of £150,000, as he 
had done in the Mr Taylor case:283

“I don’t know the answer to that, but it certainly wouldn’t have been the first time 
– that’s probably pretty high, but I’d been over 100 a few times and no one had ever 
said to me afterwards, “You didn’t have authority to do that”, internally.”

6.23  This lack of clarity over the financial limits of senior executives within the organisation becomes 
a matter of serious concern when taken in conjunction with allegations of an attempt to keep 
more senior management in the dark over important issues. It is certainly arguable that Mr 
Myler and Mr Crone had no choice other than to raise the Gordon Taylor case with James 
Murdoch, simply because the cost of settling the case had got beyond what either of them 
could imagine they had authority to approve. Financial controls are normally set in order 
to  ensure  that  decisions  of  a  level  of  importance  to  an  organisation  are  taken  by  people 
in commensurate positions of authority and responsibility. If the delegated authorities are 
able to be easily breached then the ability of senior management to exercise oversight and 
governance is obviously reduced. Issues of alleged cover up have been addressed elsewhere.284

Cash payments

6.24  One of the changes made by Mr Myler upon his arrival as editor was the introduction of 
new controls on cash payments, which required department heads to ensure that payments 
were legal and legitimate, or ‘real payments to real people for stories that really exist’.285 As

533

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFa result of the new policies cash payments fell by around 89% from 2004/5 to 2007/8.286 Mr 
Myler estimated that the majority of this change was due to a change of staff and processes 
in the features department.287 This rather startling outcome suggests that, prior to Mr Myler’s 
arrival, there was less than rigorous control of the use of cash. This is not an insignificant issue. 
Part of the NoTW’s explanation as to how Mr Goodman had managed to task Mr Mulcaire 
without management being aware of what was going on was that he had paid Mulcaire cash 
outside  of  an  otherwise  legitimate  contract.  Whether  or  not  that  was  true,  the  fact  that 
the rules on cash expenses would allow it demonstrates, yet again, a lack of oversight and 
governance within the organisation that allowed inappropriate, or even illegal, behaviour to 
go unnoticed and unchecked. 

Expenses claims

6.25  Finally on the issue of financial controls I turn to the claiming of expenses. Mr McMullan 
suggested that in order to ‘bump up salaries’ staff were given a certain amount of leeway on 
expense claims. He suggested that he would generally claim between £15,000 and £20,000 of 
expenses in a year of which only £3,000 was legitimate.288 Mr McMullan further suggested that 
an expansive approach to expenses was expected, and even encouraged by management.289 
This approach to expenses was broadly consistent with the account told by Ms Marshall in 
her book, Tabloid Girl, where she describes numerous examples of fabricated expense claims. 
In the book Ms Marshall describes the practices of journalists in relation to expenses as “all 
very definitely illegal”290 and justifies such practices on the grounds that they “...sort of made 
up for all the years of impossible tasks, lousy years and bollockings”.291 

6.26 

In her oral evidence Ms Marshall explained that all the specific examples of expense fraud in 
the book were anecdotal, but that the general attitude in the newsroom was that outrageous 
expense claims were funny rather than to be frowned on. She pointed out “we’re not ripping 
off  the  taxpayer”.292  Although  she  back-tracked  from  most  of  the  specific  examples  in  the 
book, this expenses culture was one of the few areas where the basic thrust of Ms Marshall’s 
evidence was consistent across both the book and her evidence to the Inquiry, and on that 
basis  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  it  was  true.  Whilst  Ms  Marshall’s  evidence  on  the 
culture in respect of expenses was not directed specifically at the NoTW she suggested that 
this approach was common across all titles she had worked at. It should also be observed 
that Ms Marshall’s general mantra in relation to assertions made in her book, namely that 
they amounted to ‘topspin’, was one I did not find particularly convincing in the context of 
her evidence as a whole. I allow for an element of exaggeration and ‘gilding of the lily’, but 
have come to the conclusion that her book contained a substantial kernel of truth, and her 
attempts to backtrack from it were not persuasive.

6.27  Ms Marshall’s evidence was flatly contradicted by Mr Thurlbeck, who said that Mr Kuttner, 
the managing editor, was a forensic examiner of newspaper expenses. Everything required a 
receipt and any questionable claims would be returned and an explanation required.293 The

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFdeputy editor, Mr Wallis supported Mr Thurlbeck’s assertions but, if that were the case, it is 
difficult to see why Mr Myler felt driven to change the system or the dramatic effect of that 
change.294 

Bribery

6.28  Given the current police investigations into bribery of police and public officials, this Report 
cannot go into any detail on any specific allegations. However, some anecdotal evidence of 
little evidential value was offered. Mr McMullan said that he was aware of the NoTW paying 
police officers for information. He gave the Inquiry an example of taking a phone call from 
a royal bodyguard with information about where Princess Diana would be at a given time, 
indicating that the source might have been paid as much as £30,000 for such information 
because  of  the  risks  of  providing  it.295  More  significantly,  Deputy  Assistant  Commissioner 
Akers  told  the  Inquiry  that  the  police  had  material  that  identified  an  ex-NoTW  journalist 
who may have paid police for information. The police have arrested a number of ex-senior 
managers for authorising and facilitating such payments.296 

6.29 

It  is  not  possible  to  go  further  but  it  seems  fair  to  conclude  that  there  is,  at  least,  a  real 
possibility that there was a culture of payments at the NoTW for information of the type 
discussed, facilitated or overlooked by management control of financial authorisations. 

Attitude to the PCC

6.30  A key issue in understanding the NoTW’s approach to compliance is the attitude to the PCC. In 
this context I consider the PCC both as a body that enforces the Editors’ Code and in respect 
of its two considerations of the phone hacking issue. 

6.31  Taking enforcement of the Code first, I have already set out above that Mr Myler, when he 
became editor of the NoTW, made it clear that compliance with the law and the PCC code 
was mandatory, and that disciplinary procedures would follow for failure to comply. However, 
also as set out above, there is no evidence to show that failure to comply with the Code did 
result in any disciplinary action. 

6.32  A number of NoTW journalists told the Inquiry that individuals at the newspaper did take 
the  PCC  seriously,297  owing  to  the  embarrassment  to  editors  of  an  adverse  adjudication. 
Specifically, Mr Wallis told the Inquiry 298

“We didn’t want to fall foul of either legal problems or the PCC. An editor is not going 
to survive very long if he has a series of legal judgments against him. An editor is not 
going to survive very long if he has a series of PCC adjudications against him. It costs 
money.”

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldF6.33 

6.34 

He said that the senior executives constantly made it clear to journalists that they were not 
interested in the idea of breaking the law, breaching the PCC Code, risking libel claims or 
spending a lot of money on privacy law battles.299 

It seems a reasonable conclusion from what has been set out in this Chapter that, although the 
NoTW may have had at all times appropriate policies in place to require journalists to comply 
with both the Editors’ Code and the criminal law, and although individual journalists may 
have considered it important to do so, there was no clear line of accountability for oversight 
or enforcement of those policies: compliance, if it occurred, was accidental, rather than the 
consequence of the implementation of sound systems of governance. It is not possible within 
the confines of Part One of this Inquiry to allocate blame to individuals; neither, however, at 
this stage is it appropriate to exonerate any one individual at a senior level of responsibility 
within the corporate hierarchy. 

It is at least possible that this systematic failure to hold anyone to account for breaches of the 
Code might have led to a sense among journalists at the NoTW that compliance was not, in 
fact, particularly highly rated and that breaches of the Code would go unpunished. If breaches 
of the Code lead to more, or better, stories, then systematic failure to penalise anyone for 
breaching  the  Code  could  be  seen  as  indirect  encouragement  to  do  so.  The  fact  that  Mr 
Goodman was dismissed does at least suggest that the company was aware that it needed to 
appear to the outside world as though it took criminal activity seriously. The terms on which 
he  parted  from  the  company,  however,  and  the  discussions  that  preceded  his  departure, 
suggest that this was not altogether the case. The persistent failure of the company properly 
to investigate Mr Goodman’s allegations that methods of unlawful interception were both 
widely in use and approved by management within the organisation was a significant failure 
of governance.

6.35 

I have already set out in earlier Sections of the Report the circumstances of the two PCC 
considerations of phone hacking and the NoTW response. It suffices to say that an organisation 
which,  at  the  very  least,  overstated  the  assurance  that  it  was  prepared  to  provide  to  its 
regulatory body (even, or perhaps especially, a self-regulatory body) is not an organisation 
that takes compliance seriously. It is clear that at no time did it occur to management at the 
NoTW to seek to drill down to discover precisely what Mr Mulcaire had done for the large 
amount of money he was paid or to respond openly to the enquiries made by the PCC. The 
same point can be made about the attitude of NoTW executives to the Select Committee 
Inquiries. 

Attitude to the courts

6.36  Finally, it is important to consider what the Inquiry has learned about the attitude of journalists 
and executives at the NoTW to the courts. It is notable that many of the NoTW witnesses, 
particularly Mr Thurlbeck, have maintained that, regardless of the judgment in the case, the 
story about Mr Mosley was in the public interest. The lack of respect for the judgment of 
Mr Justice Eady is perhaps exemplified by the fact that Mr Myler put the story forward for 
a ‘scoop of the year’ award.300 Any disappointed litigant is entitled to feel that the judge got 
it wrong but the evidence gives no sense of re-appraisal of the position in the light of the 
judgment: there does not appear to have been any detailed reconsideration or point by point

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicFrebuttal of the reasoning of the judge, such as might permit senior management to conclude 
that a review of their approach to issues of the kind generated by the case was unnecessary. 

6.37  Similarly, Mr Mahmood refused to accept criticisms of him made by Mr Justice Eady in relation 
to  a  story  which  exposed  a  plot  to  kidnap  the  children  of  David  and  Victoria  Beckham.301 
In such circumstances, it is perhaps unsurprising that Mr Crone testified that his advice to 
executives about the attitude that a court would be likely to take in any litigation was not 
always acted upon.302 

7.	 Credibility	of	witnesses
7.1 

NI has raised the point that the NoTW at any one time employed around 152 editorial staff, of 
whom only three have come forward to make allegations on the record of the issues covered 
in this Chapter of the Report. In addition, some five anonymous journalists have raised issues 
of concern about conduct at the NoTW. This is a tiny proportion of those who worked there. 
I accept this; I also accept that, with some exceptions, others who have given evidence who 
have worked at the NoTW have tended to disagree with the picture painted by Mr McMullan, 
Mr Driscoll and Mr Hoare. I have already pointed out that the evidence of these witnesses 
needs to be viewed with some caution. Furthermore, I am entirely content to accept that large 
parts of the NoTW, and many of the journalists, operated in a way that no-one has suggested 
was not entirely appropriate and in accordance with high standards. To some extent, those 
journalists are also victims having suffered damage to their individual reputations because of 
what has emerged from the NoTW over the last few years. 

7.2 

7.3 

Having said that, however, for reasons which I have already given I do not consider that the 
evidence of bad practice to which I have referred can be disregarded. The evidence of these 
three whistleblowers and of the anonymous journalists in relation both to the use of the ‘dark 
arts’ and bullying possesses an internal consistency which provides considerable credibility, 
but it also coheres with other evidence, including the admissions made by the NoTW in civil 
proceedings, as well as evidence from victims of unethical press practices. For the purposes 
of this Report I do not have to take a view on precisely the extent to which any of these 
witnesses  is  providing  a  full  and  complete  picture.  Rather,  I  simply  need  to  satisfy  myself 
that there are cultural and ethical issues here which require addressing in the context of my 
finding that there is an essential kernel of truth within what each of these witnesses said. 

It is also the case, as detailed in this Chapter, that even ignoring the evidence of those whom 
NI submit cannot be relied upon, and focusing only on the evidence of witnesses such as 
Messrs  Myler,  Thurlbeck,  Edmondson  and  Crone  have  given,  very  serious  concerns  arise 
about the governance at the NoTW, the attitude of management and staff to the right to 
privacy, the attitude of management and staff to the law and the attitude of management to 
public scrutiny. 

The consequences
The possible criminal behaviour and its impact on the individuals involved are obviously very 
serious, but are not for this Report. What is, however, clear is that the financial implications

Chapter 4 | Some Practices at the News of the WorldFfor NI and ultimately for News Corp have been significant, from the costs of the civil claim 
settlements,  the  costs  of  the  closure  of  the  NoTW,  including  lost  revenue,  the  failure  of 
the BSkyB takeover and the commercial opportunities that that presented, through to the 
reputational damage done to the image of News Corp across the globe and any ramifications 
that  may  have.  It  may  never  be  possible  to  quantify  those  costs,  and  certainly  it  is  not 
necessary for me to attempt to do so, but Rupert Murdoch told the Inquiry that the scandal 
had cost News Corp ‘hundreds of millions’.303

I conclude this Chapter of the Report with setting out the evidence of Mr Murdoch and his 
overall assessment of the phone hacking issue, both for the light it throws on that issue, and 
more generally:304

“I think the senior executives were all informed, and I – were all misinformed and 
shielded from anything that was going on there, and I do blame one or two people for 
that, who perhaps I shouldn’t name, because for all I know they may be arrested yet, 
but there’s no question in my mind that maybe even the editor, but certainly beyond 
that someone took charge of a cover-up, which we were victim to and I regret and, 
you know, I’m getting ahead of myself now, perhaps, or getting ahead of you when 
I say that, you know, we did take steps after the conviction and the resignation of 
Mr Coulson. A new editor was appointed with specific instructions to find out what 
was going on. He did, I believe, put in two or three new sort of steps of regulation, if 
you like, but never reported back that there was more hacking than we’d been told. 
Harbottle & Lewis were appointed, and given a file. Now, it’s argued that they were 
only given a very specific brief, but I’ve got to say that I have not gone through that 
whole file that they were given of emails, but I have again tasted them and I cannot 
understand a law firm reading that and not ringing the chief executive of a company 
and saying, “Hey, you’ve got some big problems.”

Chapter 5 
Some CaSe StudieS

Introduction

The previous Chapter explored the culture, practices and ethics prevailing at the News of the 
World (NoTW) before its demise. This, and the following Chapter, takes a broader view. They 
seek to examine the wider evidence submitted to the Inquiry in some detail, with a view to 
making a general assessment of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, in line with the 
Terms of Reference. It should be understood that it is not possible or desirable to cover all the 
evidence submitted to the Inquiry in the Report: some of it will be referred to simply by way 
of footnotes to the main text; other parts of the evidence will not be mentioned expressly 
at all.

In this Chapter, before proceeding to examine the evidence as a whole,1 I examine in detail a 
number of individual examples of press reporting in recent years. Some of those examples will 
be well known to many reading this report and include the reporting of the disappearance of 
Amanda (Milly) Dowler, the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, the arrest of Christopher 
Jefferies on suspicion of murder and the publication of details of the medical condition of 
the former Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown’s son. The first three of those, at least, 
were chosen because they exemplified what might be described as the most egregious cases 
of unethical journalistic conduct.

The  final  examples  included  in  this  Chapter  are  defined  by  the  fact  that  they  are 
contemporaneous with the Inquiry; they are stories which emerged during the course of, or 
subsequent to, the formal hearings, and may indicate that the risks identified in the following 
Chapter  cannot  be  dismissed  as  historical.  They  include  the  Daily  Mail’s  attack  on  Hugh 
Grant’s ‘mendacious smears’, the press treatment of the family of Sebastian Bowles after his 
death, and the contrasting approach to the recent stories which impacted on the privacy of 
two members of the Royal Family.

All (except the Royal examples) were subjected to detailed scrutiny during the course of the 
Inquiry. The theme common to them all, and which therefore merits their generic description 
as ‘case studies’, is their link to the next chapter of the Report containing the wider criticisms 
of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, and the emergence of patterns. In other 
words, each case study exemplifies at least one and often several of the attributes of and 
flaws in the press which have been addressed at length below;2 in this Chapter, however, 
they are not addressed from the perspective of the criticism but rather from the perspective 
of the victim, thereby providing some insight into the overall impact of the way in which the 
relevant story has been reported. Accordingly, the time taken to examine these cases is not 
for the purpose of levelling specific criticisms against individual titles and journalists (although 
I recognise that this might be a by-product of the exercise) but for the light they shine on 
the wider picture. It follows that the analysis of each case study will not be exhaustive; it 
will merely be sufficient to illuminate and buttress the generic conclusions that I have felt it 
appropriate to reach.

1.5  What follows in this introductory section is a thumbnail sketch of each of these case studies, 

as a prelude to the more detailed analysis set out in subsequent chapters.

1.9 

The evidence relating to the reporting of the disappearance of Milly Dowler is examined as 
the first of these case studies. This Inquiry was set up in the light of the public reaction to 
the Guardian’s story published on 4 July 2011 that the voicemail of Milly Dowler was hacked 
into and tampered with by one or more journalists from the NoTW, such that a number of 
her voicemail messages were deleted, thereby giving her family false hope in her well being.3 
The evidence relating to these allegations will need to be examined, not least because the 
Guardian later retracted that part of its story that asserted that one or more messages had 
been deleted.

Of equal if not greater importance, however, is that Mr and Mrs Dowler were subjected to 
intrusive and insensitive press reporting at a time of intense personal distress. Such was the 
appetite in certain sections of the press to acquire information and photographs which would 
enable ‘the story’ to be kept alive as one of ongoing human interest to readers, these sections 
of the press often overlooked the privacy rights and personal feelings of the Dowler family. 
Thus, the family came to be treated as little more than a commodity in which the press had 
an unrestricted interest.

The  Inquiry  also  heard  at  length  from  Dr  Kate  and  Dr  Gerry  McCann,  who,  following  the 
disappearance  of  their  daughter  Madeleine  in  Portugal  in  May  2007,  were  the  victims  of 
what may only be fairly described as serial defamations in a number of newspapers between 
September 2007 and January 2008. The McCanns were initially the subject of balanced and 
sensitive press reporting in the British press: not merely did the story attract the open-hearted 
sympathy of the public, owing to the way that it resonated on a number of obvious levels, but 
the parents took a strategic decision at a very early stage to engage with the press in order to 
avail the search for their daughter.

By the summer of 2007, however, what had begun as a sympathetic approach by the press 
to an ongoing personal tragedy had altered; this change had been prompted by ‘leaks’ from 
the Portuguese police to the local and British media representing their version or speculation 
of what might have happened to Madeleine. Some, but certainly by no means all, sections of 
the press in the UK decided to run with stories which alleged that the McCanns were in some 
way responsible for the disappearance of their daughter. One title prided itself in the fact 
that it was apparently fair minded because on one day it would print a hostile story while the 
next it would provide a more sympathetic portrayal. The defamatory reporting continued for 
approximately four months, the principal perpetrator asserting that the public appetite for 
the story was undiminished. Ultimately, it took the threat and then the reality of libel action 
to bring this spate of reporting to an end, and the McCanns received substantial damages and 
a front page apology in settlement of their claims.

1.10 

It was inevitable and entirely in the public interest that there be full reporting of stories about 
both Milly Dowler and Madeleine McCann. Like the Dowlers, however, the McCanns were 
also treated as if they were a commodity in which the public, and by extension the press, had 
an interest or stake that effectively trumped their individual rights to privacy, dignity or basic 
respect. The press believed that the public’s legitimate interest in the story was insatiable, 
and that belief required it to sustain that interest by following every possible development 
or turn, however implausible or apparently defamatory. Also like the Dowlers, the McCanns 
were the victims of grossly intrusive reporting, prying photographers and an ongoing ‘media

540

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicscrum’ which paid little or no regard to their personal space, their own personal distress and, 
in particular, the interests of Madeleine’s younger siblings.

1.11  There are two other aspects of the McCann ‘case study’ which merits its inclusion as such. 
First, the PCC did nothing until it was too late, and the reasons for this inactivity need to 
be explored. Secondly, the NoTW published highly personal extracts from Dr Kate McCann’s 
diary in September 2008 following a telephone conversation between its news editor and the 
McCanns’ spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, on 12 September. The Inquiry was provided with a 
transcript of that conversation at an early stage, but without knowing the full background 
it was difficult to discern the true purpose of the conversation and what was understood or 
agreed by or between the participants to it. However, when he came to give evidence, the 
news editor accepted that Mr Mitchell had been deliberately misled so that it would appear 
that  he  had  given  his  consent  to  the  publication  of  the  extracts  on  behalf  of  Dr  McCann 
whereas in truth he had not.

1.12  Another  individual  who  was  the  victim  of  unbalanced,  prejudicial  and  wildly  inaccurate 
press reporting was Christopher Jefferies, who was arrested on suspicion of being involved 
in  the murder of  Joanna  Yeates on  30 December 2010. Mr Jefferies gave evidence to  the 
Inquiry  and,  notwithstanding  the  remarkably  measured  and  dispassionate  terms  in  which 
it was given, testified to a series of egregiously defamatory and unfair articles in a number 
of  national  newspapers  over  the  New  Year  period,  which  hinted,  rumoured,  speculated, 
suggested, or at times indicated that he was the perpetrator. Again, this is a very clear example 
of injudicious, sensationalised and intemperate reporting which was designed to feed what 
the newspapers concerned judged to be the curiosity and prurient interest of their readers; 
this was no doubt, supported by an (entirely erroneous) assessment that the police had ‘got 
the right man’. In the result, the police had not: Mr Jefferies was released, initially on police 
bail;  subsequently,  the  perpetrator  of  Ms  Yeates’  murder  (who  had  provided  information 
which  purported  to  implicate  Mr  Jefferies)  was  arrested,  charged  and  convicted  at  a  trial 
which did not challenge responsibility for the killing. Mr Jefferies brought defamation actions 
against a number of newspapers, and the Attorney General successfully brought contempt 
proceedings against two.

1.13  The next case study which will be examined concerns the story published in The Sun in 2006 
regarding the illness of one of Mr Brown’s children. This story is of interest for a number 
of  connected  reasons.  First,  even  without  disclosing  its  source  so  as  to  permit  his  or  her 
identification, The Sun has refused to explain how the story was sourced. The second reason 
concerns  the  absence  of  any  public  interest  justification  for  publishing  a  story  about  the 
health (ie the private life) of a child; and the third is the circumstances in which the paper 
sought to obtain the consent of Mr and Mrs Brown to its publication. The evidence in this last 
respect has clear resonances with the evidence of Anne Diamond, the broadcast journalist 
and  presenter,  relating  to  the  death  of  her  infant  son  and  her  enforced  association  with 
The Sun’s cot death charitable appeal, and the evidence relating to the obtaining of Dr Kate 
McCann’s consent, through a conversation with her agent, to the publication of extracts from 
her personal diary.

1.14  There is much that could be discussed about the evidence that actor Hugh Grant provided 
and he would be the first to say that press treatment of those who have achieved what is 
called ‘celebrity status’ should only be considered behind the complaints of people like the 
Dowlers, the McCanns and Mr Jefferies. He is included as a case study because of a detail in 
his evidence and the reaction that it provoked. He gave evidence to the Inquiry as to his belief 
that a story in The Mail on Sunday about an alleged flirtation with a ‘plummy-voiced executive’ 
had been obtained by voicemail hacking. Mr Grant accepted that he had no hard evidence to 

541

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFsupport this belief; it was an exercise in speculation (although it might otherwise be described 
as inference). The day after he had appeared before the Inquiry, on 22 November 2011, the 
Daily Mail published a piece which accused Mr Grant of making a ‘mendacious smear’ against 
the Mail titles. It is of value because it is a good example of the strategy of ‘defensive attack’ 
(although the Mail titles argue that the story was entirely justified) which itself represents a 
strand within the culture of the press. It is also of interest since the relevant evidence grew 
out of the Inquiry’s proceedings themselves.

1.15  During the course of the Inquiry, Sebastian Bowles, an 11-year old schoolboy, was tragically 
killed in a coach crash in Switzerland. Unfortunately, his family was subjected to insensitive 
and intrusive press reporting which failed to respect their privacy and their grief. The evidence 
given by the family solicitor, Giles Crown, chimed with evidence given during the course of 
Module One of the Inquiry, more fully set out and footnoted below. Again, this has been 
selected by the Inquiry as a case study because it is illustrative of a clear strand within the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press, as well as shining light on the effectiveness of the 
PCC.

1.16  The final Section of this Chapter deals with two significant stories which entered the public 
domain after the formal Inquiry sessions concluded in July 2012. They relate to the private 
lives of two members of the Royal Family, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge. The 
intrusions in relation to Prince Harry, and the contrast with the approach to the story relating 
to the Duchess of Cambridge and the ramifications of both, form the basis of an important 
case study, illustrating as it does a series of generic issues surrounding the approach to clause 
3 of the Editors’ Code and the general provision relating to the public interest; the relevance 
of publication on the internet; and the overall response (or lack of it) of the Press Complaints 
Commission (PCC).

F

2.  the dowlers
2.1 

Bob and Sally Dowler fully appreciated that the disappearance of their daughter, Amanda, 
known as Milly, was a ‘massive news story’. From the start, the press was ‘like a double-edged 
sword’:4 as many have pointed out in similar vein, there is often a fine line between the need 
to engage the press to publicise a predicament or a cause, and the dangers of press intrusion. 
As Mrs Dowler explained in her witness statement:5

‘‘What we did not appreciate was the extent to which the newspapers would intrude 
on our private turmoil and how little control we would have over where the lines were 
drawn in this respect. We did not have any experience in dealing with the media and 
we have to make a lot of difficult choices, without the benefit of professional advice 
and at an extremely harrowing time in our lives. It felt like a lot of our decisions to 
engage the press had ramifications beyond those you could logically expect.’’

2.2 

The  Dowlers  gave  examples  of  two  types  of  media  intrusion  which,  in  the  light  of  all  the 
other evidence the Inquiry was subsequently to receive, appear to be commonplace. First, 
in the months following Milly’s disappearance, Mr Dowler was frequently ‘door stepped’ by 
journalists and photographers looking for a story. In the words of Mrs Dowler:6

542

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public‘‘Bob would be in the front garden and a reporter would pop up asking a question 
about  the  case.  In  our  experience,  the  journalists  rarely  started  by  introducing 
themselves. They would simply launch into a series of questions about Milly...’’

2.3 

Second, a particularly poignant piece of evidence concerns an occasion when the Dowlers 
decided  to  walk  home  from  Walton-on-Thames  railway  station  following  the  route  which 
Milly habitually took. This was intended to be an intensely private moment. As Mrs Dowler 
explained to the Inquiry:7

‘‘I  met  Bob  and  then  we  just  basically  quietly  retraced  her  steps  and  no  one  was 
really around, so it was very much like the day she’d actually gone missing, and we 
put out missing leaflets with her photograph and a telephone number on, and that 
number had been changed, and I was checking the posters to see if the number – if 
the right poster was up, and as I walked along, I was sort of touching the posters. And 
we walked back to our house, which is maybe three-quarters of a mile, something 
like that, and that was on the Thursday, and then on the Sunday, that photograph 
appeared in the News of the World and I can remember seeing it and I was really 
cross because we didn’t see anyone. They’d obviously taken the picture with some 
sort of telephoto lens. How on earth did they know we were doing that walk on that 
day? And it just felt like such an intrusion into a really, really private grief moment, 
really.’’

2.4 

2.5 

2.6 

An article in the NoTW published on 12 May 2002 was headlined, ‘The Longest Walk’. The 
secondary headline was, ‘Face etched with pain, missing Milly’s mum softly touches a poster 
of her girl as she and her hubby retrace her last footsteps.’ Although this doubtless made a 
story replete with human interest, it is difficult to argue with Mrs Dowler’s observation that 
this was an unjustified intrusion into a moment of private grief. The very language of the 
article indicates that the NoTW was well aware of the intrusion, but whether the editor or 
sub-editor gave any thought to whether it might be justified is impossible to know at this 
distance. If he or she did, the judgment reached was misconceived.

One of the questions which the Dowlers asked themselves at the time was ‘how on earth 
did they know that we were doing that walk on that day?’8 There is no evidence that NoTW 
photographers were carrying out day-to-day surveillance of the Dowlers on the off-chance; 
had they been doing so, obvious ethical concerns would arise. Another possible inference (as 
to which I make no finding) is that the NoTW discovered the Dowlers’ likely whereabouts on 
the day by listening to a phone message.

The Dowlers also gave evidence as to the occasion on which Mrs Dowler gained access to 
Milly’s personal voicemail message, having previously only been able to hear the automated 
message. To the best of their recollection this occurred in April or May 2002 after a visit to the 
Birdseye building at Walton-on-Thames in order to view some CCTV footage. As Mrs Dowler 
told the Inquiry:9

‘‘we were sitting downstairs in reception and I rang her phone ... And it clicked through 
onto her voicemail, so I heard her voice, and it was just like – I jumped – “She’s picked

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFup her voicemails, Bob, she’s alive”, and I just – it was then, really. Look, when we 
were told about the hacking, that is the first thing I thought.’’

2.7 

2.8 

At  the  time  Mrs  Dowler  managed  to  access  her  daughter’s  voicemail  it  is  clear  from  the 
evidence that emerged during the course of the criminal proceedings that Milly was already 
dead. The ‘false hope moment’, as it came to be described, was generated by the fact that 
voicemails on the system were deleted, with the consequence that the automated message 
– signifying a full voicemail – was replaced by the personal voicemail greeting.

In the article published on 4 July 2011 the Guardian’s account was along the lines that NoTW 
journalists, or someone acting on their behalf, were responsible for the deletion of these 
messages. However, the accuracy of this account was questioned in December 2011, and 
given its obvious importance the Inquiry sought further assistance from the Metropolitan 
Police Service (MPS) and Surrey Police who undertook a full investigation into what happened. 
Ultimately,  in  May  2012  the  Inquiry  received  a  witness  statement  from  Detective  Chief 
Inspector John MacDonald, of the MPS, which was read into the record.10

2.9 

This  evidence  conclusively  established  that  the  Dowlers  had  visited  the  Birdseye  building 
shortly after 18:00hrs on 24 March 2002, which was three days after Milly’s disappearance. 
The family liaison officer’s log records:11

‘‘At 19:10 hours Mr and Mrs Dowler were taken home by the FLO. Whilst at home, 
Mrs Dowler rang Milly’s mobile. The log records that Mrs Dowler ‘became distressed 
as Milly’s voicemail was now on the recorded message whereas previously there was 
a recorded message (automated).’’

F

2.10  Although call data subsequently established that the time of Mrs Dowler’s call was 18:32hrs 
(ie over 30 minutes earlier than the FLO’s log record, which was completed after the event), it 
is clear from all the available evidence that the ‘false hope moment’ occurred during the early 
evening of 24 March 2002 and not in April or May as the Dowlers had originally believed. They 
are not to be criticised for this in any way, since at the time of giving their witness statement 
they were being asked to recall traumatic events occurring nearly a decade beforehand.

2.11  DCI  MacDonald’s  investigation  revealed  that  Milly’s  last  call  to  her  own  voicemail  was  at 
17:07hrs on 20 March, and one of Milly’s friends called her voicemail at 19:46hrs on 21 March 
and left a message. This was almost certainly the tenth message left on Milly’s voicemail: at 
this point, the mailbox was full, and a ‘generic’ (ie automated) message was left. But, after  
72 hours, messages began to be automatically deleted. In the words of DCI MacDonald:12

‘‘The phone provider has also confirmed that when the voicemail box was full the 
automated message would be heard, and once messages had started to drop off, 
the personal voicemail greeting that Mrs Dowler heard would again have come into 
effect.’’

544

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.12  Accordingly, the probable inference is that Mrs Dowler’s call was made shortly after one of 
the previous messages was deleted – 72¾ hours had elapsed between Milly’s friend’s call and 
Mrs Dowler’s.

2.13  There are two additional pieces of evidence which fall to be considered, although on analysis 
they do not bear on the genesis of the ‘false hope moment’. First, on 26 March 2002 there 
was a voicemail platform migration by the service provider, Mercury one2one. That migration 
included Milly’s voicemail. It would have had the effect of resetting Milly’s personal greeting 
to an automated voicemail message, which would have remained as such until changed by 
the owner of the phone. Yet this occurred two days after the key date for present purposes, 
and  could  have  had  no  impact  on  the  false  hope  moment.  Second,  DCI  MacDonald  gave 
evidence that a message left on Milly’s voicemail at 14:10hrs on 26 March was shown as 
a saved message when Surrey Police listened to it at 15:25hrs. The issue is complicated by 
the fact that there were a number of technical matters being carried out on that day by the 
service provider, but in the words of DCI MacDonald:13

‘‘It is not possible to state why the message left at 14:10 hours on 26 March was 
shown as a saved message when Surrey Police listened to it at 15:25. One possibility 
is that it was subject to an illegal intercept in that 75 minute period. However we 
should also consider the lack of a complete set of call data for that time when trying 
to interpret what happened.’’

2.14 

It is neither necessary nor appropriate for present purposes to delve further into these issues. 
Unnecessary, because whatever happened on 26 March 2002 can have no logical bearing on 
Mrs Dowler’s state of mind two days earlier, and inappropriate, because the whole issue of 
possible illegal interception of Milly’s voicemails is now the subject of criminal proceedings. 
It is, however, appropriate to make reference to what was said on behalf of the Guardian 
newspaper on 9 May 2012 immediately after DCI MacDonald’s evidence had been read:14

‘‘The Guardian story of 4 July 2011 was based on multiple sources and their state of 
knowledge at the time. Our error, as we acknowledged and corrected last December, 
was to have written about the cause of the deletions as a fact rather than as the 
belief of several people involved in the case. We regret that. After five more months 
of  intensive  inquiry,  the  police  have  found  that  the  passage  of  time  and  the  loss 
of  evidence  means  that  ‘reaching  a  definitive  conclusion  is  not  and  may  never  be 
possible.’’

2.15 

It would be otiose for the Inquiry to comment on the Guardian’s expression of regret, which 
speaks for itself. Whereas it is true that a definitive conclusion is not possible on the existing 
state of the evidence, and may never be, the Inquiry does conclude on the lower standard 
of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of Milly 
Dowler’s voicemail was not the cause of the ‘false hope moment’: this resulted from nothing 
less banal than the automatic deletion of messages in the ordinary course of the workings of 
the system.

2.16  But it remains worthwhile to underline that the essential gravamen of the Guardian’s original 
story of 4 July 2011, namely that Milly Dowler’s phone was hacked by or on the instructions 
of journalists employed by the NoTW, was correct, and is now the subject of criminal charges.

2.17  Surrey Police have submitted detailed evidence to the Inquiry and to the Culture, Media and 
Sport (CMS) Select Committee bearing on this issue.15 This establishes that shortly before 13 
April 2002 NoTW reporters listened to at least four voicemail messages left on Milly’s phone, 
one of which (timed at 10:13hrs on 27 March 2002) they had transcribed as follows:

‘‘Hello  Mandy.  This  is  [REDACTED  from  [REDACTED]  recruitment  agency.  We  are 
ringing  because  we  are  starting  interviewing  today  at  [REDACTED].  Call  back  on 
[REDACTED]. Thanks. Bye.’’

2.18  The NoTW apparently deduced from this that Milly was still alive and using the name ‘Mandy’ 
to seek work in the area where the agency was based. The agency notified Mercia Police 
that it had received two telephone calls from a woman claiming to be Mrs Dowler (either a 
hoaxer or a journalist) asking whether Milly was working for them. The agency gave out no 
information to the caller, but on 13 April 2002 NoTW reporters attended at the premises of 
the agency in search of further leads. At 12:10hrs on 13 April the joint owner of the agency 
contacted Surrey Police by telephone, stating:

‘‘We have had a News of the World reporter... harassing us today. He says that our 
agency has recruited Milly as an employee, demanding to know what we know and 
saying that he is working in full co-operation with the police.’’

2.19  That  last  assertion  was  of  course  untrue.  Surrey  Police  then  contacted  the  NoTW  which 
admitted that it had acquired its information from Milly’s phone (claiming to have obtained 
the  number  and  PIN  from  school  children)  and  confirming  that  it  had  a  recording  of  the 
voicemail message.

2.20  Later  on  13  April  the  NoTW  contacted  Surrey  Police  claiming  that  it  was  confident  of  its 
sources and that it was intending to print the information it had relayed to the police as a 
news story. Despite police warnings that the message was probably the work of a hoaxer, the 
NoTW went into print on Sunday 14 April 2002 with its angle on the story.

2.21 

It  is  unnecessary  for  the  Inquiry  to  investigate  every  aspect  of  this  somewhat  convoluted 
sequence of events, which undoubtedly would have impacted on the police investigation in 
April 2002. Surrey Police carried out no arrests at the time, but detailed investigations have 
been conducted pursuant to Operation Weeting. It is sufficient for present purposes to state 
that the main thrust of the article published in the Guardian on 4 July 2011, that Milly Dowler’s 
voicemail was hacked into by NoTW journalists, was correct. As the Dowlers explained in their 
witness statement, they received substantial compensation from News International (NI) to 
mark the egregious conduct of their employees. Even if that conduct did not embrace causing 
the ‘false hope moment’, its characterisation as egregious remains apposite.

2.22  The Guardian’s error in relation to the circumstances in which Milly’s voicemail messages 
were  deleted  was  significant  although,  in  the  light  of  all  the  circumstances,  had  it  been 
couched in more cautious or less certain terms may not have been capable of criticism at all. 
It certainly did not justify the attack that followed: I am certainly not criticising it or the paper. 
Nor, as I pointed out on 4 December 2011, does the Guardian’s error in any way undermine

The fact remains that the NoTW hacked the phone of a dead schoolgirl called Milly Dowler. 
The revelation of that story rightly shocked the public conscience in a way that other stories 
of phone hacking may not have, but it also gave momentum to growing calls for light to be 
shed on an unethical and unlawful practice of which there were literally thousands of victims. 
In that context, whether or not NoTW journalists had caused the “false hope” moment is 
almost irrelevant.

3.  Kate and Gerry mcCann
3.1 

In his submissions opening Module One of the Inquiry, David Sherborne, Counsel for the Core 
Participant Victims, described the press treatment of the McCanns as a ‘national scandal’: 
not merely had they suffered the personal tragedy of the abduction of their daughter, they 
were subjected to a barrage of press reporting which could only be fairly characterised as a 
diatribe. Clearly, therefore, it is appropriate to take the experience of the McCanns as a ‘case 
study’ warranting further examination for the light it throws on the culture, practices and 
ethics of the press. Their case is also highly illuminating in the context of the action, or rather 
the inaction, of the PCC.

The McCanns’ personal perspective

3.2  Madeleine  McCann  was  abducted  from  a  holiday  apartment  in  Praia  da  Luz,  Portugal,  on 
3 May 2007, shortly before her fourth birthday. Her parents were dining with a number of 
friends  at  a  tapas  bar  within  the  holiday  complex  and  also  within  sight  of  the  apartment 
where  she  was  sleeping,  together  with  her  younger  twin  siblings.  As  Dr  Gerry  McCann’s 
witness statement makes clear, much has already been written about the details concerning 
Madeleine’s disappearance, and no one reading this Report is likely to be unaware of the 
basic facts. These include the fact that the McCanns are still searching for their daughter. In 
terms of the chronology, however, it should be noted that on 7 September 2007 the McCanns 
were accorded the status of arguidos (ie persons of specific interest to the investigation, but 
not a synonym for an accused) by the Portuguese Policia Judicaria (PJ). This was somewhat of 
a watershed in terms of the nature and quality of press reporting.

3.3 

Just as the Dowlers had articulated the need to engage with the press in order to gain their 
assistance and support, the McCanns explained that they had no option but to implement a 
proactive press strategy: they were in a foreign jurisdiction, and time was of the essence in 
this, as in all other, child abduction cases. Such were the pressures of press engagement that 
it was necessary at an early stage to enlist the full-time assistance of a press advisor, Clarence 
Mitchell;  he  had  been  seconded  to  the  Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Office  as  part  of  the 
media liaison at this town. Dr McCann stressed to the Inquiry that the initial experiences of 
dealing with the press were positive:17

‘‘I think for those people who can remember, it was a very unusual scenario, and we 
got a distinct impression that there was a genuine want to help attitude from the 
journalists there, and I think also many of the executives who perhaps saw what had 
happened to us and there was a huge amount of empathy. So I really did feel early on 
there was a desire to help.’’

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesF3.4 

Unfortunately, these favourable impressions began to dissipate when the McCanns returned 
home from Portugal. Much has been said by other witnesses about press intrusion and the 
behaviour, in particular, of paparazzi; the experiences of the McCanns were no different. They 
had become a news item, a commodity, almost a piece of public property where the public’s 
right to know possessed few, if any, boundaries. As Dr McCann explained:18

‘‘When we got back to our home in Rothley, again there were tens of journalists – we 
live in a cul de sac, at the end of it – camped outside our house, cameras, helicopter 
crews following us. We were hemmed in the house for a couple of days before the 
police moved them to the end of our drive.
Q.  Then you tell us that photographers were still banging on car windows, even with 
one or more children in the car; is that right?
MRS McCANN19: And they stayed there until December 2007.That was only after we 
had help to get them removed, but they were there every day, and they’d wait for 
Gerry to go and they knew I’d have to come out of the house at some point with 
the children. It would be the same photograph every day, we’d be in the car, myself 
and two children, the photographers would either spring out from behind a hedge to 
get a startled look that they could attach “fragile”, “furious”, whatever they wanted 
to put with the headline, but there were several occasions where they would bang 
on the windows, sometimes with the camera lenses, and Amelie said to me several 
times, “Mummy, I’m scared.”

F

3.5 

In answer to the suggestion that the positive decision made by the McCanns to engage with 
the press in order to serve their own interests effectively meant that they had waived their 
rights to privacy and everything else, Dr McCann said this:20

‘‘Well, it has been argued on many occasions that by engaging then it was more or 
less open season, and I think it’s crass and insensitive to suggest that by engaging 
with a view to trying to find your daughter, that the press can write whatever they 
want about you without punishment.’’

3.6 

3.7 

Dr McCann was not of course suggesting that the press was obliged to write about him only 
on his terms rather than on theirs. However, the point he was making was entirely valid; a 
decision to engage with the press does not make a private person public property for virtually 
all purposes, still less does it begin to justify defamatory reporting.

The protracted spate of defamatory reporting commenced in September 2007 and had to 
be endured by the McCanns over four torrid months ending in January 2008. It only stopped 
after the McCanns were driven to take legal action against the worst perpetrators. It is well 
known  that  British  newspapers  were  relying  on  reports  in  Portuguese  journals  and  other 
sources which were either associated with, close to, or directly part of the PJ. But, as the 
McCanns themselves explained, the British press often did not know the source; or did not 
know  whether  it  was  accurate,  exaggerated  or  downright  untruthful;  or  (as  the  McCanns 
believed) sometimes made up.21

A number of titles were guilty of gross libels of the McCanns and of serious and total failure 
to apply anything approaching the standards to which each has said they aspire.22 For that 
reason, the nature of the errors perpetrated by certain sections of the press will be explored, 
but at this stage it is sufficient to make the observation that, aside from the gross inaccuracy 
of the reporting in issue, some of it was, to put it bluntly, outrageous. One particular piece 
in the Daily Star published on 26 November 2007 certainly justifies being so described and 
Dr McCann was moved to go yet further:23

“Q.  “Maddie ‘sold’ by hard-up McCanns.” This is the article you do refer to, the selling 
into white slavery allegation. Probably you don’t want to dignify that with a comment?
A.  That’s nothing short of disgusting.
MRS McCANN: I think this same journalist, if memory serves right, also said we stored 
her body in a freezer. I mean, we just ...
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Just to make the comment, there’s absolutely no source for 
that assertion in the article.’’

3.9 

3.10 

In  January  2008,  letters  before  action  were  sent  to  a  number  of  newspapers.  The  first 
response  came  from  Northern  &  Shell,  on  behalf  of  the  Daily  Express,  on  7  February. 
According to Dr McCann, the Express rejected the complaint on the straightforward ground 
that the McCanns were arguidos, but the paper suggested that they do an interview with OK! 
magazine; this was an offer which was rightly (and without any exaggeration) characterised 
by Dr McCann as ‘rather breathtaking’.24

It  did  not  take  very  long,  however,  for  Northern  &  Shell  to  modify  their  position  and,  on  
19 March 2008, a statement was read out in open court in which liability was admitted. The 
settlement also involved the making of a substantial payment into the Madeleine fund and 
the printing of an apology on the front page of the Daily Express and the Daily Star.25 The 
apology correctly pointed out that ‘it is difficult to conceive of a more serious allegation’. It 
also correctly recognised that ‘there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that Mr and Mrs 
McCann were responsible for the death of their daughter, they were involved in any cover up 
and there was no basis for Express Newspapers to allege otherwise’. Given this admission, it is 
difficult to understand why the defamatory articles ever saw the light of day in the first place.

3.11 

It should also be mentioned that others involved at the periphery of the McCann tragedy 
were  the  subject  of  defamatory  reporting  which  led  to  substantial  libel  settlements.  
Mr Robert Murat was wrongly accused of being involved in some way in the abduction and 
was traduced in the British press; and the friends of the McCanns who had dined with them

articles published in the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard over a five month period, as well as over 18 articles on 
the latter’s website. These proceedings were compromised by the payment of a substantial donation to the Madeleine 
search fund and the publication of an apology in the Evening Standard. The Daily Mail were willing to publish a number 
of ‘free adverts’ to aid the search, but refused to publish any apology, claiming that the supportive articles they had 
written counter-balanced the others. As Dr McCann explained, by that stage he did not wish to embark on a protracted 
dispute with the newspaper, particularly given the need to maintain good relations with the press in continuing to 
publicise the search for Madeleine

up.

3.12 

If ever there were an example of a story which ran totally out of control, this is one. The 
appetite  for  ‘news’  became  insatiable,  and  once  the  original  story  had  run  its  course  the 
desire  to  find  new  leads  and  ‘angles’  began  to  take  over,  with  their  corollary  tendencies 
of  sensationalism  and  scandal.  Not  merely  was  the  rigorous  search  for  the  truth  the  first 
principle to be sacrificed but also was any respect for the dignity, privacy and wellbeing of 
the McCanns.

3.13  Sections of the press have suggested that this was very much a ‘one off’ and scarcely illustrative 
of their culture, practices and ethics. But all the material evidenced below26 indicates that 
this is not the case: although the treatment of the McCanns may very well be one of the 
most egregious examples, the inquiry heard examples of similar practices from numerous 
witnesses. As paragraph 373 of the CMS Select Committee’s Second Report, dated 9 February 
2010, makes clear:27

“The newspaper industry’s assertion that the McCann case is a one-off event shows 
that it is in denial about the scale and gravity of what went wrong, and about the 
need to learn from those mistakes.”

The press perspective

F

3.14  The Inquiry heard from two of the Daily Express journalists involved in reporting the McCann 
story. No criticism is made or to be inferred of them, because it was not their decision to run 
with the story generally or to publish any specific or individual pieces. For present purposes 
it is necessary to draw attention only to a short extract from the witness statement of one of 
the journalists:28

“Although  I  was  confident  of  the  veracity  of  the  reports  I  was  writing,  due  to  the 
secrecy  of  justice  laws  they  were  impossible  to  prove,  to  any  satisfactory  legal 
standard, at that time...Due to the restrictions of the Portuguese law, anyone who 
was unhappy about something that had been written or said about them and wished 
to take action would almost certainly have been successful. As a journalist this is a 
wholly unsatisfactory position which, in my view, leaves news organisations at the 
mercy of potential litigants. They simply are unable to defend themselves.”

3.15  The witness elaborated on this in oral evidence, and stated that he was certain that there 
were conversations between the news desk and lawyers about this. He continued: ‘and that 
was the situation we were in and there was no way round it’.29 This reveals much about the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press. The journalist made it sound as if his newspaper 
was in the metaphorical cleft stick but, even on cursory analysis, this was not the case. There 
was no imperative to continue to report on the McCanns, still less to tell this particular story 
unless, of course, it is accepted that there was overwhelming pressure, both commercial and 
otherwise, to tell it. The news desk recognised that if the story were told on the basis of the

unconfirmed reports coming out of Portugal, then ‘anyone who was unhappy’ would have 
had a close to cast-iron claim.

It is of interest that the journalist could not bring himself to mention the McCanns by name; 
they, after all, would be the prime candidates for being ‘unhappy’ about the story. By then, 
they had become almost depersonalised, a commodity. Further, the newspaper decided to 
publish in the face of the concerns they had identified, placing themselves at ‘the mercy of 
potential litigants’. Again, the McCanns are not mentioned by name and the newspaper is 
close to being placed in the role of victim. As the journalist put it, ‘they [the newspaper] 
simply are unable to defend themselves’. One might have thought that the more sensible 
response to this assessment, rather than bemoaning the apparent unfairness of being placed 
in an impossible position, would have been the prudent course of not publishing stories which 
not only could they not prove, but for which they had not a scintilla of evidence. Behind the 
scenes briefings by police officers, themselves under pressure and constrained by Portuguese 
law which were passed through third and fourth parties, could hardly be thought to constitute 
any, let alone a sound, basis for publishing such allegations as truth.

3.17  These issues were taken up with the editor of the Daily Express at the relevant time, Peter 
Hill. He frankly accepted that running the McCann story was very high risk,30 given all the 
factors identified by his journalists. When asked to explain why he chose to publish in those 
circumstances, Mr Hill explained:31

‘‘Because  this  was  an  unprecedented  story  that  in  my  years  of  experience  I  can’t 
remember the like. There was an enormous clamour for information and there was 
enormous – there was an enormous push for information. It was an international 
story, on an enormous scale, and there had not been a story involving individuals, as 
opposed to huge events, like that in my experience and it was not a story that you 
could ignore and you simply had to try to cover it as best you could.’’

3.18  But ‘covering it as best you could’ meant running a story in circumstances where there was 
a high chance that it was untrue and, in any event, was utterly unprovable. Mr Hill accepted 
the ‘very high risk’,32 and felt driven to publish anyway, placing him and his paper in ethical 
difficulties in the context of clause 1 of the Editors’ Code and legal difficulties with the law of 
defamation. His answer also betrays a curious form of logic: if, as was probable, the particular 
story  was  untrue,  then  it  both  could  and  should  have  been  rejected.  A  different,  truthful 
and,  by  definition,  better  story  should  have  been  written  based  on  the  research  that  the 
journalists could undertake that generated facts that could be proved. ‘Covering it as best you 
could’ did not mean throwing caution to the winds.

3.19  Mr Hill was also asked whether the interests of the McCanns were taken into account. He was 

adamant that they were:33

‘Of  course.  We  published  many,  many,  many,  many  stories  of  all  kinds  about  the 
McCanns, many stories that were deeply sympathetic to them, some which were not’

551

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesF3.20  Unfortunately, Mr Hill’s answer betrays a similar curious form of logic: the deeply sympathetic 
stories on this approach should be regarded as being capable of being weighed in the balance 
in some way against the stories ‘which were not’, these being the stories which, as was put 
to Mr Hill, accused the McCanns of killing their child. His answer to that proposition was that 
the stories he ran were only repeating the accusations of the Portuguese police.34

3.21  The  self  same  logic  underpinned  the  evidence  of  the  proprietor  of  Express  Newspapers, 

Richard Desmond, when he was asked about this topic. Mr Desmond said this:35

‘‘I’m not trying to win points here, because we did do wrong, but I could say there 
were more, if there were 102 articles on the McCanns, there were 38 bad ones, then 
one would say – and I’m not trying to justify, please, I’m not trying to justify anything, 
but you could argue there were 65 or 70 good ones.’’

3.22  Notwithstanding the language deployed, this was an attempt by Mr Desmond to expiate, or 
at the very least to mitigate, his company’s conduct, which simply fails to recognise that it is 
completely misconceived.36 It is additionally unfortunate that further questions revealed that 
Mr Desmond’s apology was not entirely unqualified:37

‘‘and once again I do apologise to the McCanns, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et 
cetera, but there are views on – there are views on the McCanns of what happened. 
And  there  are  still  views  on  the  McCanns  of  what  happened...What  I  think  is  free 
speech is very important and if we get any more regulation – I mean, what are we 
trying to do in this country? Are we trying to kill the whole country with every bit of 
legislation and every bit of nonsense?’’

F

3.23  This was another revealing answer, since by it Mr Desmond revealed what I consider to be a 
very disturbing philosophical approach to the concepts of free speech and a free press. For 
him, at the end of the day, the issue was all about free speech and the threat of excessive 
regulation. On this approach, press standards and ethics were close to being irrelevant. Mr 
Desmond  had  made  that  clear  towards  the  start  of  his  evidence,  when  he  disputed  that 
ethical lines could be drawn.38 Finally, it should be noted in this context that Mr Desmond 
was inclined to blame the PCC for failing to give his paper guidance39 rather than accept that 
his editor should accept at least some responsibility.

3.24  The PCC should have done more, but Express Newspapers could not reasonably infer from 
the PCC’s inaction that their action was ethical. Mr Desmond, like his Finance Director Paul 
Ashford,40 also blamed the PCC for acting hypocritically by criticising Mr Hill after the event, 
particularly  in circumstances where Express Newspapers had  behaved no  differently from 
anyone else. There is merit in the argument that an even-handed regulator should have taken

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publiceveryone to task and there is force in the point that criticism of the approach of the press 
generally could and should have gone wider, but this is not an allegation of hypocrisy: the 
PCC were not applauding the conduct of other titles while condemning the Express (which 
demonstrated the most egregious failings); they were simply using emotive language borne 
out of a degree of anger to condemn the Express and saying nothing about others.41

3.25  On the other hand, the real point is that a regulator, acting in the interests of the public, while 
respecting free speech, should have taken much firmer action in relation to the way in which 
this story was reported, even though the titles affected would have found unpalatable the 
criticism that they should have faced. That the PCC did too little too late is not a complaint 
which it lies in Mr Desmond’s mouth to make.

3.26  One of Mr Hill’s journalists had said in evidence that his editor was ‘obsessed’ with the story. 
Mr Hill rejected that description of his state of mind,42 although in explaining his motives and 
reasons for persevering over so many months, his revealing answer was as follows:43

‘‘I’ve  already  explained  to  you  the  basis  for  that  decision,  which  had  gone  all  the 
way back to my time on the Daily Star when I had realised that it was – that the 
readers were more – the readers continued to be interested in the stories far longer 
than the journalists, and it was my policy to continue the stories and I followed it 
with many different stories. It started with Big Brother, it went on to Princess Diana, 
various other things, and that had always been my policy. It was nothing to do with 
an obsession, it was more to do with a method of working.’’

3.27 

In other words, Mr Hill’s ‘method of working’ tended to discern little or no difference between 
‘Big Brother’ and the McCanns: this was all about similar commodities and what he believed 
his readers were interested in. The obvious potential link between what Express readers were 
apparently interested in and circulation figures was one which the Inquiry explored, but in 
the end it was not possible to reach any firm conclusions. Mr Hill testified that he believed 
that circulation went up as a result of the McCann stories and that this was a factor in his 
persisting with them.44 He himself viewed the circulation figures and came to that empirical 
conclusion.  However,  the  Inquiry’s  examination  of  the  data  did  not  disclose  any  clearly 
discernible patterns.45

3.28  Overall  the  justifications  advanced  by  Messrs  Hill  and  Desmond  for  the  frankly  appalling 
treatment of the McCanns were, as has been clearly demonstrated, both self-serving and 
without foundation.

The PCC’s response

3.29  Two days after Madeleine’s disappearance, the PCC contacted the British Embassy in Lisbon 
and  asked the consular  service to  inform the McCanns  that the services of  the PCC were

1 January 2007 and 4 January 2009) was provided to the Inquiry on a confidential basis. It has not been published as it

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFavailable to them. Dr Gerry McCann’s evidence was that he was unaware of this until 2009 
when he gave evidence before the CMS Select Committee. He told that Committee that he 
did not recall receiving such a message but, had he done so, it would have been lost in all the 
other information the family was bombarded with at the time.46

3.30  Dr McCann accepted that the PCC had been extremely helpful in dealing with the unwanted 
intrusion into the privacy of the twins.47 The PCC intervened to contact editors and broadcasters 
reminding  them  of  the  Code  and,  thus,  not  to  take  photographs  or  similar  images  of  the 
children; this practice stopped.48 The PCC was also helpful in removing photographers from 
outside the McCanns’ driveway, although this was only after “what we felt was a very long 
period”.49

3.31  A meeting took place between Dr McCann and Sir Christopher Meyer, former PCC Chairman, 
on 13 July 2007. There is no dispute between them as to what was said. Sir Christopher’s 
evidence  was  that  he  explained  to  Dr  McCann,  at  a  time  when  there  had  only  been  one 
complaint to the PCC against a newspaper and that was not proceeded with, that he effectively 
had a choice: either he could complain to the PCC, or he could take legal action, but he could 
not pursue both courses simultaneously.50 When asked what the PCC did for the McCanns 
over the most distressing period, which was between September 2007 and January 2008, Sir 
Christopher said this:51

F

‘‘We were in pretty close contact with the press handlers of the McCanns. By that 
time, it was as gentleman called Clarence Mitchell, who I think may have appeared 
before you, and we stood ready to intervene if they wanted it. We come again to the 
question of the first party. You see, you can’t be more royalist than the king on these 
matters. You cannot wish to stop something more ardently than the first party. But by 
that time, I think they had chosen to go to law. I can’t say exactly, because it’s not for 
me to say, when they first hired Carter Ruck. So it’s not as if we were sitting there...’’

3.32  This was a roundabout way of saying that the PCC did nothing. True, the PCC was on hand if 
the McCanns had not decided to litigate, but they should not have been presented with such 
a choice. Given the options which Sir Christopher had himself explained to Dr McCann, and 
given the scale of the defamatory treatment to which he and his wife had been subjected, 
this  was  a  classic  case  of  Hobson’s  choice.  Further,  as  Dr  McCann  himself  pointed  out,  it 
was invidious that he and his wife were being asked to contemplate bringing a complaint 
against a body on which the editor of the Daily Express sat. A regulator of press standards, 
worthy of that name, would not have left the McCanns in such a predicament at the time of 
their maximum distress. Either the McCanns should not have been presented with mutually 
incompatible  alternatives  and  given  the  option  of  pursuing  both,  or  the  PCC  should  have 
been ‘more royalist than the king’ (to quote Sir Christopher) and taken unilateral action.

3.33  Sir Christopher took the editor of the Daily Express to task for his conduct on the very day that 
the McCanns’ libel action was settled. This was too little, too late, and even after the facts 
had been conclusively established (by admission) the PCC took no formal action. As the CMS

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicSelect Committee correctly pointed out, and as will be discussed in more detail below,52 the 
PCC was empowered under its Articles of Association to launch an inquiry in the absence of 
a complaint. The McCann case ought to have been visualised as a prime candidate for such a 
course of action.

3.34  The Inquiry cannot improve on the conclusions of the CMS Select Committee in February 

2010 when reviewing the McCann case:53

‘374.  In any other industry suffering such a collective breakdown – as for example 
in  the  banking  sector  now  –  any  regulator  worth  its  salt  would  have  instigated 
an enquiry. The press, indeed, would have been clamouring for it to do so. It is an 
indictment on the PCC’s record, that it signally failed to do so.
375.  The industry’s words and actions suggest a desire to bury the affair without 
confronting its serious implications – a kind of avoidance which newspapers would 
criticise mercilessly, and rightly, if it occurred in any other part of society. The PCC, by 
failing to take firm action, let slip an opportunity to prevent or at least mitigate some 
of the most damaging aspects of this episode, and in doing so lent credence to the 
view that it lacks teeth and is slow to challenge the newspaper industry.’

The Kate McCann Diaries

3.35  Dr Kate McCann had kept a personal diary recording her innermost thoughts and feelings 
following the disappearance of her daughter. It was intensely private, and she did not share 
its contents even with her husband. The diary was seized by the PJ in August 2007 pursuant 
to its investigations, but the Portuguese court ordered its return to Dr McCann, as well as the 
destruction of all copies in its possession. The PJ had translated the diary into Portuguese and 
unfortunately one of the copies of the translated version found its way into the hands of a 
Portuguese journalist.

3.36  A former NoTW journalist told the Inquiry how a copy of the diary was acquired by the paper 
on payment of a substantial sum and then translated back into English. As Dr McCann pointed 
out in her evidence, the re-translated text did not completely match the wording of the actual 
diaries, but this is a minor point when set against the scale of the violation to her privacy 
which came to be perpetrated.

3.37  The journalist’s understanding was that the news editor, Ian Edmondson, would ‘confirm with 
the McCann press spokesperson that the diary was genuine’, and would obtain his consent to 
publish extracts from the diary. However, his written and oral evidence about these matters 
was somewhat vague,54 not because he was seeking to mislead the Inquiry in any way but for 
reasons which will soon become apparent.

3.38  One piece of evidence given by the journalist was particularly revealing:55

‘But I think in terms of considering it being appropriate to publish Mrs McCann’s diary 
and the obvious considerations over privacy, the view taken by senior executives was 
that there were all sorts of false allegations being made about the McCanns and they

really were being pilloried in the press, that this account gave a true picture of the 
McCanns and dispelled some of the lies being written about them’

In other words, the predominant consideration was not concerns about the McCanns’ priva-
cy but rather the newspaper’s own evaluation that this was a sympathetic story which placed 
them in a good light and was above all else true. This is exactly the same sort of reasoning 
process which the Inquiry has so often noted in its review of the critical material below.56

3.39  Colin Myler, the editor of the NoTW at the time, was asked about these matters. He had had 
previous  dealings  with  the  McCanns  and  had,  for  example,  berated  Dr  Gerry  McCann  for 
doing an interview with Hello! Magazine in preference to the NoTW.57 His version of events 
was that his news editor, Ian Edmondson, obtained consent to the publication of extracts 
from the diaries from Mr Mitchell:58

‘‘Q.  But the obvious question, Mr Myler, is this: why did you not telephone either of 
the McCanns and find out whether they consented?
A.  Because Ian Edmondson had assured me on more than one occasion that Clarence 
was aware of what we were intending to do and had said, “Good”. I think it was very 
clear from Mr Edmondson’s point of view how he’d spelt out what he was doing, and 
indeed I stressed very clearly by using the phrase that I did not want Kate to come 
out of church on Sunday morning and find that the diaries were there without her 
knowledge.
Q.  But you were of course aware that if Dr Kate McCann had not given her consent to 
the publication of this personal diary, she would be outraged by the publication. You 
were aware of that, weren’t you?
A.  I wouldn’t have published if I’d thought that she hadn’t been made aware of it.
Q.  And Mr Edmondson was telling you that he’d obtained consent on what day?
A.  Well, it was absolutely clear from the Friday to the Saturday that that assurance 
had been given to him and given again to me.
Q.  It was going to be a front page story, wasn’t it?’’

3.40  Mr Edmondson’s account differed from Mr Myler’s. He explained that he tape-recorded his 
telephone conversation with Mr Mitchell without the latter’s knowledge in the interests of 
‘accuracy’, although he accepted that this entailed an element of misleading his interlocutor.59 
Mr Edmondson was asked to state whether he made it clear to Mr Mitchell that it was the 
intention of the NoTW to publish extracts from the diary verbatim. It is worth setting out his 
answer in full:60

‘‘A.  I didn’t make it clear.
Q.  And you say because you were given express instructions by Mr Myler?

556

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicA.  Correct.
Q.  When did he give you those instructions? Can you recall?
A.  From memory, at a meeting on Thursday of that week.
Q.  Why did he give you those instructions?
A.  I attended a meeting with Mr Myler and Tom Crone where we discussed this story. 
I think we got the story to a point where I was prepared to present it to Tom and 
Colin, the editor. Colin gave – sorry, I beg your pardon, Tom gave his legal view, which 
I’m told I’m not allowed to repeat, but which dismayed, shall I say, Mr Myler. So he 
decided to ask me to make a call to Mr Mitchell, not make it clear what we had, tell 
him in general terms, basically make it very woolly. I think someone previously used 
the word “ambiguous”, and that is absolutely spot on what he wanted.
Q.  So the preferred outcome for the end point of the conversation with Mr Mitchell 
would be what?
A.  To give him the impression that we were running a story but not tell him specifically 
what story, certainly don’t tell him that we were in possession of the complete diaries, 
as we understood. There had been extracts in the diaries – of the diaries in Portuguese 
papers which had been translated into the English papers, but certainly not to the 
extent that we had. He was frightened that if Clarence knew what we had, he might 
take action.
Q.  Well, he would do – was the fear that he would, at the very least, tell his clients, 
the McCanns, what was going on?
A.  Correct.
Q.  And they would certainly get back to Mr Myler by phone?
A.  Correct.
Q.  Or make an application for an injunction to stop the News of the World publishing? 
Is that what it amount to?
A.  That’s exactly what it would.’’

3.41  This  was  devastating  evidence.  It  would  be  remarkable  if  Mr  Edmondson  was  seeking  to 
mislead the Inquiry regarding Mr Mitchell being given a ‘woolly’ or an ‘ambiguous’ account 
of  the  newspaper’s  intentions:  it  was  a  frank  admission  of  unethical  conduct  and  fits  the 
transcript of the conversation. Mr Edmondson’s version of events was not available when  
Mr Myler testified some eight weeks previously, but it has since been put to him for comment. 
It is inherently more probable that Mr Edmondson would have been acting on instructions 
with regard to an issue of this nature rather than making the executive decision himself. In 
any event, the frankness and precision of his evidence on this issue, including his reference 
to Tom Crone and legal advice, renders it more likely than not61 that his account is correct.

3.42  Regardless  of  issues  of  individual  responsibility,  this  case  study  is  particularly  illuminating 
for this reason. Read in isolation and out of context, it could be said that the transcript is 
somewhat ambiguous so that it could be deployed in support of a contention that, in some 
way, Mr Mitchell consented on behalf of the McCanns to the publication of extracts from the 
diaries. Thus, it was regarded by the paper as important to obtain written evidence which 
could be used if necessary to justify what happened. Read in the context of Mr Edmondson’s 
explanation, however, the position is crystal clear. It is equally clear that deliberate decisions 

61 para 2.54,Part F, Chapter 4

557

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFwere made within the NoTW to obtain this evidence by obfuscatory tactics and to deploy 
to  their  advantage  the  fact  that  a  conversation  of  sorts  had  occurred  should  the  need 
subsequently arise. In the result, there was a letter before action, and the matter was settled 
without the necessity of its ventilation in court.

3.43  But the impact on Dr Kate McCann in particular was traumatic. As Dr Gerry McCann explained 

in his witness statement, ‘Kate was distraught and morally raped.’62

3.44  What the McCanns did not make explicit when giving their evidence, but was or ought to 
have been entirely obvious to any empathetic observer, is that the conduct of the press as 
highlighted in this section of the Report served only to magnify and compound their distress 
and upset consequent upon the abduction of their daughter.

3.45  Overall, it is impossible to disagree with Professor Brian Cathcart, professor of journalism at 

Kingston University, and his pithy and trenchant assessment:63

“I draw the analogy with, you know, other areas of life. If there’s a railway accident, 
there  is  an  inquiry  and  lessons  are  learned.  In  the  press,  I  was  very  influenced  by 
observing the McCann case develop over month after month after month like a slow 
motion  crash,  and  yet  there  was  no  introspection  in  the  industry  afterwards.  The 
damages were paid, the books were closed, and they moved on. That is not – you 
know, we wouldn’t accept in the railway industry or in, for example, a hospital, we 
wouldn’t accept that nobody went back and assessed what had happened and tried 
to identify how things could be changed to prevent it happening again. So I think a 
mechanism – a regulator who is prepared to go in and do that is essential.”

4.	 Christopher	Jefferies

4.1 

4.2 

Introduction
Joanna Yeates was the tenant of Christopher Jefferies who owned a number of flats in the 
Clifton area of Bristol. Mr Jefferies is a retired English teacher, having enjoyed a long and 
distinguished  career  at  Clifton  College  between  1967  and  2001.  On  19  December  2010  
Ms Yeates’ partner, who had been away for the weekend, reported her as missing to the 
police.  On  Christmas  Day  her  body  was  found  at  the  edge  of  a  quarry  three  miles  away; 
she had been strangled to death. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary opened a large-scale 
murder investigation and press interest in the story was, understandably, massive.

Unsurprisingly, given that he was the victim’s landlord, Mr Jefferies was invited to assist the 
police with their inquiries, and he voluntarily provided two witness statements. Totally out of the 
blue as far as he was concerned, at about 7am on 30 December 2010 Mr Jefferies was arrested 
by officers of Avon and Somerset Constabulary and then taken into custody for questioning. This 
lasted for three days, whereupon Mr Jefferies was released on police bail. On 22 January 2011 
Vincent Tabak was arrested on suspicion of murder, and he was formally charged the following 
day. For reasons which it is unnecessary to address here, Mr Jefferies’ bail conditions were not 
formally lifted until 4 March 2011. Tabak pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Ms Yeates on 
5 May and, as is well known, he was convicted of Ms Yeates’ murder on 28 October 2011.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public4.3 

Press reporting while Christopher Jefferies was in custody
From  the  moment  he  was  arrested  on  30  December  2010,  any  publication  in  relation  to  
Mr Jefferies was subject to the ‘strict liability rule’ set out in section 2(2) of the Contempt 
of Court Act 1981: in other words, it would be a contempt of court for any publication to 
create a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question (commenced 
by the fact of the arrest) would be seriously impeded or prejudiced. This placed significant 
constraints on the nature and scope of subsequent press reporting. The issue was not simply 
one of balance; a newspaper could be in contempt by virtue of publishing one prejudicial 
article, even if the same newspaper published many favourable ones. It is noteworthy that 
on 31 December 2010 the Attorney General, having seen the first wave of reporting in certain 
sections of the press, felt compelled to issue a public statement to editors warning them of 
the need to comply with the 1981 Act. Additionally, there were the limitations imposed by 
clause 1 of the Editors’ Code and the general law of defamation.

4.4 

The most damaging articles appeared in the press between 31 December 2010 and 2 January 
2011. Mr Jefferies’ own characterisation of this material was that it amounted to a ‘frenzied 
campaign to blacken my character’, and contained the ‘wildest flights of fantasy’. As he put 
the matter in his witness statement:64

‘I can see now that, following my arrest, the national media shamelessly vilified me. 
The UK press set about what can only be described as a witch-hunt. It was clear that 
the tabloid press had decided that I was guilty of Ms Yeates’ murder and seemed 
determined to persuade the public of my guilt... by publishing a series of very serious 
allegations  about  me  which  were  completely  untrue,  allegations  which  were  a 
mixture  of  smear,  innuendo  and  complete  fiction.  I  have  been  told  by  friends  and 
family that while I was in custody extraordinary efforts were made by the media to 
contact anyone who may have had any knowledge about me, including friends from 
schooldays whom I had not seen for some considerable time, and former pupils. The 
tabloid press undertook what was quite simply gratuitous dirt-digging’

4.5  Mr Jefferies gave evidence about what he called the ‘eight worst offending articles’ which were 
published  in  six  separate  newspapers  over  a  three  day  period.65  Three  of  these  featured  in 
contempt of court proceedings brought by the Attorney General in July 2011, which was after it 
had been conclusively established that Mr Jefferies could not have been the killer. In the result, 
News Group Newspapers (NGN) Ltd was fined £18,000 in respect of an article published in The 
Sun on 1 January 2011, and Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) Ltd was fined £50,000 in relation 
to articles published in the Daily Mirror on 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011 respectively.

4.6 

It is unnecessary to dwell on the language and tone of the ‘offending articles’. It is sufficient 
to draw on their characterisation by the Lord Chief Justice in the contempt proceedings. As 
for the article published in The Sun on 1 January 2011, Lord Judge said:66

‘The  articles  in  the  one  issue  of  The  Sun  were  written  and  laid  out  in  such  a  way 
that they would have conveyed to the reader of the front page and the two inside 
pages over which the stories were spread that he was a stalker, with an obsession 
with death, who let himself into the flats of other occupants of the building where

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFMiss Yeates lived, and that he had an unhealthy interest in blonde young women. ... 
Although the articles contain statements or words which could be said to have been 
favourable to Mr Jefferies, these were quite insufficient to counter the way in which 
the spread of the articles, and their content, associated Mr Jefferies with this murder. 
These  articles  would  have  certainly  justified  an  abuse  of  process  argument,  and 
although their effect is not as grave as that of two series of articles contained in the 
Mirror, the vilification of Mr Jefferies created a very serious risk that the preparation 
of his defence would be damaged...’

4.7 

And as for the articles published in the Daily Mirror on 31 December 2010 and 1 January 
2011, he went on:67

‘The material in the two publications of the Daily Mirror is extreme. True, it does not 
positively  assert  that  Mr  Jefferies  was  guilty  of  involvement  in  paedophile  crimes, 
or the unsolved murdered many years earlier. It is submitted that the articles were 
unflattering, suggesting that he was an eccentric loner. So they were. But they went 
very much further. It was asserted, in effect directly, that his standard of behaviour, 
so far as sexual matters were concerned was unacceptable, and he was linked to both 
the paedophile offences and the much earlier murder offence. That indeed was the 
point of the articles. The juxtaposition of the photographs of two murdered women, 
together with the layout of the places where they died in proximity to Mr Jefferies 
home, was stark. And in the context of the murder of Miss Yeates herself, the second 
article  implied  that  Mr  Jefferies  was  in  a  particularly  convenient  position,  as  her 
landlord, to have gained access to her premises to commit a murder, according to the 
article, committed by an intruder...’

F

4.8 

Ultimately,  Mr  Jefferies  successfully  brought  proceedings  for  defamation  against  eight 
newspapers68  in  relation  to  allegations  contained  in  40  separate  articles.69  At  the  hearing 
before Mr Justice Tugendhat on 29 July 2011 when the libel settlements were announced, 
Mr Jefferies’ solicitor said this:70

‘‘Christopher Jefferies is the latest victim of the regular witch hunts and character 
assassination conduct by the worst elements of the British tabloid media. Many of 
the stories published in these newspapers are designed to ‘monster’ the individual, in 
flagrant disregard of his reputation, privacy and rights to a fair trial.’’

4.9 

Similar strictures had previously been made in a somewhat different tone, but with equivalent 
accuracy, by Ms Yeates’ partner, Greg Reardon, who issued a press statement on 1 January 
2011 in these terms:71

‘Jo’s life was cut short tragically but the finger pointing and character assassination 
by social and news media of as yet innocent men had been shameful. It has made 
me lose a lot of faith in the morality of the British press and those who spend their 
time fixed to the internet in this modern age ... I hope in the future they will show a

4.10  But, as Mr Jefferies has pointed out,72 the majority of newspapers failed to print this section 

of his tribute, and those who did omitted critical wording, altering the meaning completely.

The press perspective

4.11  The Inquiry heard from two journalists involved in these stories, one employed by MGN and 
the other by NGN, the publishers of the Daily Mirror and The Sun newspapers generally, as 
well as from those who played an editorial role. As with the McCanns, no criticism is made 
or to be inferred of the journalists, because it was not their decision to run with the story 
generally or to publish any specific or individual pieces.

4.12 

It is clear from their evidence that a number of former pupils of Mr Jefferies were approached 
by journalists to give their views of his character, personality and temperament. This in itself 
was a risky and unwise course of action; it could be treated as an opportunity for old scores 
to be settled, and some may also have believed that there could be no smoke without fire. To 
their credit, not every pupil succumbed to these temptations. Whereas it is true that many 
of the articles written about Mr Jefferies included favourable material, the point made by 
the Lord Chief Justice in the contempt proceedings (namely that this was quite insufficient to 
nullify the prejudicial impact of the disparaging material) is of course entirely valid; and in any 
event that which spoke of Mr Jefferies in positive terms did not do full justice to the quality 
and  weight  of  that  material.  Furthermore,  evidence  given  by  one  of  the  journalists  does 
altogether chime with evidence the Inquiry has already noted in relation to the McCanns:73

‘‘Well, obviously hindsight’s a wonderful thing, and looking back, we – everybody at 
the Daily Mirror is very regretful of the coverage and we do apologise to Mr Jefferies 
for vilifying him in such a way, but you have to understand at the time it was such a 
high profile murder investigation. There was huge public interest and concern over 
the tragic death of Joanna Yeates.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I understand that. Actually, let me share this with you, Mr 
Parry: that’s one of my concerns, that everybody in retrospect will say, “Well, that 
clearly went too far and this clearly was wrong and that shouldn’t have happened 
and we’ll put in place mechanisms to try to prevent it in the future” – until the next 
enormous story comes along and it all just drains away.
A.  I accept that, but I think you’ll find that this particular story was perhaps, you 
know, a watershed moment for the industry. It wasn’t – an eye opener. It wasn’t just 
the Daily Mirror. It was a number of newspapers who fell foul of this.’’

4.13  There is clearly a sense here of the story acquiring its own close to irresistible momentum and 
running out of control. The same sense emerges from other evidence the Inquiry received, 
some of which is set out below.

4.14  The duty editor at The Sun over the New Year period in 2010/2011 was Stephen Waring, 
its  current  publishing  director,  the  editor  Dominic  Mohan  being  on  holiday.  Mr  Waring 
gave entirely frank evidence about his paper’s coverage of this story, and freely admitted

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFhis mistakes. He also volunteered the fact that he spoke to Mr Mohan about the coverage 
in the 1 January edition and that the latter said that he thought that the paper should be 
more balanced.74 Mr Waring gave the following explanations as to how the story came to be 
published in the way in which it did:75

‘‘...  to  me  there  are  three  elements  to  this.  There’s  the  material  we’d  previously 
published the day before, ie the first day of Mr Jefferies’ arrest, and there was a lot of 
critical comment about his character from four unnamed pupils, ex-teachers, people 
– former acquaintances, and that set a particular tone, which coloured my judgment 
wrongly, but that coloured the judgment. There was the nature of the story, which, 
just to put it in context, this story had been, as I say, on the front page for seven 
previous editions, there was a general bafflement as to the motive for this appalling 
murder, and Mr Jefferies’ inconsistency, as it was perceived in his story the day before 
he was arrested seemed, wrongly, to be the great breakthrough, and this led to a 
great outpouring of adverse comment about his character ... But the key aspect of 
this is the light in which this was legalled. I can’t speak for the lawyer’s own mind, but 
we are talking about an era where there was a far more liberal interpretation about 
what we could get away with in print.’’

F

4.15  This reference to what newspapers could ‘get away with in print’, which was Mr Waring’s own 
choice of language, was a reference to the application of the contempt of court legislation by 
the Attorney General. However, as the Divisional Court in the contempt proceedings amply 
made clear, the Attorney was merely applying the law as it had been set out and applied in 
the relevant legislation. If previous holders of that office had been applying a more liberal 
interpretation of the law, then newspapers were indeed ‘getting away with’ more than they 
should have done. In any event, this was not simply a question of contempt: it was a gross 
libel. Nonetheless, this evidence chimed with other evidence heard by the Inquiry that, in 
large parts of the press, the primary concerns of legal and managerial oversight are to avoid 
litigation: the fact that a particular story, or a particular method might have been unethical, 
but legal, received little attention.

4.16 

It would be wrong to leave Mr Waring’s evidence without setting out his closing remark in 
full:76

‘‘Could I just say one other thing? Please don’t judge my colleagues by the errors 
I’ve made in this edition, because they are a bunch of very committed, hard-working 
individuals, the finest journalists in Fleet Street, and the Sun is a very vibrant paper 
that is a compassionate paper. We produce 100,000 items a year. We got this one 
badly wrong and I admit that, but these mistakes do happen.’’

4.17  Richard Wallace gave evidence about the Mr Jefferies’ case in his capacity as editor of the Daily 
Mirror at the relevant time. As with Mr Waring, he frankly admitted that on this occasion his 
newspaper fell short of its own benchmark standards of fairness, justice and compassion,77 
and that this was a ‘very black mark on [his] editing record’.78 Mr Wallace claimed that the 
Daily  Mirror  was  acting  on  the  faith  of  a  number  of  off-the-record  briefings  from  police

Somerset Constabulary, Colin Port, in his witness statement to the Inquiry.80 The Inquiry is not 
in a position to resolve this potential conflict of evidence, nor does it need to. The possibility 
that the Daily Mirror was in receipt of unauthorised briefings as opposed to authorised, off-
the-record guidance has not been overlooked.

4.18  Mr Wallace was asked to consider whether there were broader reasons underlying the Daily 

Mirror’s error of judgment in this case. It is worthwhile setting out his answer in full:81

‘‘Q.  So what was it that was driving you to take such a risky decision? Was it simply 
such a big story that you couldn’t afford to ignore it?
A.  No, I made a very serious misjudgment.
Q.  I’m trying to explore what pressures were on you. Was it because of the competition 
with your rivals, who were also covering the story very extensively and in lurid terms?
A.  Competition is always keen within Fleet Street. That has led us to have a very – and 
continue to have a very vibrant press. The envy of the world, I might add. But – one 
always wants to beat the competition, but one should not become reckless in seeking 
to beat your competition. How, in your view, would you learn from the mistake that 
you made on this occasion to avoid something like this happening again?
A.  I think Mr Jefferies’ name will be imprinted on my brain forever more. It will change 
very much the way I deal with any story of this nature in the future.
Q.  Apart from that, is there any practical change that could be made to reduce the 
risk of something like this happening again?
A.  I don’t believe so, because ultimately it’s down to the judgments of editors and, 
you know, as I found in this regard and other mistakes have been highlighted, we 
all make mistakes. I’m not seeking to downplay those mistakes or dismiss them; I’m 
just saying you can have as many safeguards and checks and balances in place as 
you would like but these errors are going to happen. It’s about creating a climate, 
I  believe,  which  makes  all  editors  think  perhaps  a  little  bit  longer  than  they  have 
previously.’’

4.19  Putting  to  one  side  the  concerns  arising  from  Mr  Wallace’s  failure  to  identify  any  specific 
changes  that  could  be  introduced  to  avoid  such  reporting  in  the  future,82  he  was  right  to 
point out that editorial judgment will always be an important factor, and that mistakes will be 
made, even in the most ethical of systems. However, the final point he made in this section 
of his evidence is deserving of greater emphasis. Mr Wallace referred to the creation of a 
‘climate’; this Inquiry has throughout spoken in terms of creating a culture, and one of greater 
respect for the rights of individuals and, as in Mr Jefferies’ case, for the rule of law. The Daily 
Mirror believed that their story was accurate, otherwise they would not have published it. To 
suggest otherwise would be to accuse the paper of malice, and there is simply no evidence 
to  support  that  allegation.  It  is  possible  to  make  the  relevant  point  far  more  modestly  in 
this way: even if the story had not been defamatory, the Daily Mirror and other newspapers 
should not have published it. Mr Wallace accepted that no editor should become reckless in

seeking to beat the competition, and in this particular case he should also accept that he fell 
short of that standard too.

4.20 

It  is  worth  making  another  point  as  well.  Much  has  been  said,  quite  rightly,  about  the 
exceptionally good reporting that comes out of the press in this country. That is not, however, 
the point. What matters is the fact that poor decisions and serious lapses in the standards 
that the press set for themselves are more than occasionally evident and few papers can say 
that they have never published a story that failed to meet the standards of the Editors’ Code. 
A regulatory system is there to uphold standards for all, however they normally behave; it 
needs to exist alongside any question of redress and whether or not the particular breach 
gives rise to an actionable tort.

4.21  Mr Jefferies was the victim of a very serious injustice perpetrated by a significant section of 
the press. Without such reporting, it is hard to accept that he would have found it necessary 
to change his appearance and effectively lodge with friends for approximately three months. 
For those who have said that the Inquiry has been overly concerned with the complaints of 
celebrities, Mr Jefferies was not such an individual. Nor were the McCanns or the Dowlers. 
Clearly, all of these witnesses would have wished for nothing more than to have remained 
well out of the public eye and off the front pages of newspapers but, for reasons beyond their 
control, that was not where they found themselves.

5.  the rt hon Gordon Brown mp and his son’s illness

5.1 

5.2 

Introduction
In November 2006 The Sun published private medical information about the son of the then 
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP. At the time of publication, Mr 
Brown’s son was four months old, and the story reported his diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.83 The 
Inquiry heard extensive evidence in relation to this story and, because of the light it throws 
on a number of aspects of the culture, practices and ethics of the press, it is appropriate to 
address it in some detail. The factual disputes which arose during the course of the evidence 
will only be resolved to the extent necessary to illuminate the culture of the press in general.

For  example,  there  is  considerable  dispute  between  the  then  editor  of  The  Sun,  Rebekah 
Brooks and Mr Brown as to how the story was sourced in the first place. For a number of 
reasons  which  will  be  explained,  it  is  simply  not  possible  to  resolve  that  dispute  on  the 
available evidence, and it would have been difficult to do so even had the Inquiry decided 
to investigate the story in depth and require further evidence to be provided. What is not in 
dispute is that there was no public interest in the story sufficient to justify publication without 
the consent of Mr and Mrs Brown.84 The medical information published by the newspaper 
was  private  information  about  a  very  young  child  and  it  therefore  deserved  the  utmost 
protection. Prior to publication, only a small handful of doctors, other health workers and 
family members ought to have been, and the Browns would say were, aware of the diagnosis, 
and it would have been obvious to anyone in possession of the information that it was highly 
sensitive and not to be disclosed without consent.

5.3 

In July 2011, at the height of the phone hacking scandal, Mr Brown made further allegations 
as to how The Sun might have obtained the material for the original 2006 story. The response

564

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicof The Sun to those allegations shares similarities with the response of the Daily Mail to Hugh 
Grant’s evidence to the Inquiry, addressed at Section 6 below.

5.4 

Furthermore, Mr Brown’s evidence to the Inquiry itself generated a hostile reaction in certain 
sections  of  the  press.  That  reaction,  and  the  ultimate  resolution  of  the  issue  to  which  it 
related, is discussed below.

5.5 

The Sun’s source
The article published in The Sun on 13 July 201185 stated that the source of the original story 
was a ‘shattered dad whose own son has the crippling disease and who wanted to highlight 
the plight of sufferers’. Although the article contains the categorical denial of this gentleman 
that he had seen confidential medical records (‘all of which is the truth as I shall answer to 
God’), it is not specific as to how he had come about this information, save to allege that ‘he 
has links with the Brown family’.

5.6  Mrs Brooks was asked to explain this lack of specificity when she gave evidence. Her account 

was as follows:86

‘‘Q.  How had he got the information?
A.  He’d got the information because his own child had cystic fibrosis and he’d got 
the information, I should say, through a very small – it’s not a small charity, but there 
is a charity aspect to the Cystic Fibrosis Society, and he got it slightly by involvement 
through there.
Q.  What sort of involvement?
A.  Mr Jay, I’m not going to tell you any more about the source because I don’t want 
to reveal his identity.
Q.  But you’re not.
A.  Well,  I  feel  uncomfortable  answering  that  because  I  think  it  could  lead  to  his 
identity. You’re asking me where information came from and the source, and I think 
they are matters that I have to respect in a source coming to the newspaper. The 
main point of this issue is Mr Brown accused the Sun of hacking into his son’s medical 
records to get this story and that wasn’t true.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: It wasn’t accurate?
A.  No, sorry, it wasn’t accurate.’’

5.7 

Although the matter was pursued further with her, Mrs Brooks was adamant in her refusal 
to  breach  the  confidentiality  of  the  source.  Without  knowing  more  of  the  background 
circumstances, and exactly how the source had apparently obtained the information from 
the charity mentioned, the Inquiry is not in a position to judge whether Mrs Brooks’ refusal 
to  answer  further  questions  –  on  the  ostensible  basis  that  the  source’s  identity  might  be 
disclosed – was justified or not. Further, the possibility that the source, (assuming he existed), 
obtained this information by unlawful or unethical means has not been overlooked, but here 
again the Inquiry is in no position to make a finding.

565

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesF5.8  Mr Brown’s evidence was that The Sun’s account was incorrect, and that the information as to 
his son’s medical condition had been obtained in circumstances of a breach of confidentiality:87

‘‘In 2006, the Sun claimed that they had a story from a man in the street who happened 
to be the father of someone who suffered from cystic fibrosis. I never believed that 
could be correct. At best, he could only have been the middleman, because there were 
only a few people, medical people, who knew that our son had this condition. In fact, 
for the first three months that our son was alive, I just have to say to you, we didn’t 
know, because there were tests being done all the time to decide whether this was 
indeed his condition or not, and only by that time, just before the Sun appeared with 
this information, had the medical experts told us that there was no other diagnosis 
that they could give than that this was the case. So only a few people knew this. I 
have submitted to you a letter from Fife Health Board which makes – the National 
Health Service in Fife, that is – which makes it clear that they have apologised to us 
because they now believe it highly likely that there was unauthorised information 
given by a medical or working member of the NHS staff that allowed the Sun, in the 
end, through this middleman, to publish this story. Now, whether medical information 
should  ever  be  hounded  out  without  the  authorisation  of  a  parent  or  of  a  doctor 
through the willingness of a parent is one issue that I think it addressed, and I know 
the Press Complaints Commission code is very clear, that there are only exceptional 
circumstances in which a child’s – or information about a child should be broadcast, 
and I don’t believe that this was one of them.”

F

5.9  Mr Brown’s oral evidence contained an accurate summary of the contents of the letter from 

the Fife NHS Board to which he referred.88

5.10  The written closing submissions lodged on behalf of Mrs Brooks urge the Inquiry not to reach 
any finding of fact on the source of the story.89 The points are made that not merely was 
Mrs Brooks entitled to refuse to disclose her source, but also that NI has other documentary 
material  in  its  possession  which  could  throw  light  on  the  matter.  I  accede  to  Mrs  Brooks’ 
submissions, but not without a degree of reluctance. The letter from the Fife NHS Board does 
not conclusively prove that Mrs Brooks’ account is incorrect: full details of the investigations 
it carried out are not provided, and the term ‘very likely’ does not exclude other possibilities. 
This case study illustrates precisely the sort of difficulties which arise as and when a journalist 
such as Mrs Brooks invokes the protection for sources vouchsafed by clause 14 of the Editors’ 
Code of Practice.90 Further, it is one of the consequences of the very real protection that the 
law rightly gives to journalists in relation to sources but it serves to underline the difficulty in 
holding the press to account (or allowing the press to vindicate itself) if there is a challenge to 
the propriety of the way in which the information has been obtained. Mrs Brooks’ evidence 
to the Inquiry could well have been accurate; on the other hand, if it had been inaccurate, the 
means of exploring and demonstrating that proposition is precluded by the terms of clause 
14 if not the general law.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicConsent for publication

5.11  Mr Brown’s evidence to the Inquiry was that neither he nor his wife expressly consented to 

publication of the story. In his words:91

“Our press office was phoned by a journalist from the Sun and said that they had 
this  story  about  our  son’s  condition  and  they  were  going  to  publish  it.  I  was  then 
contacted. I was engaged in the pre-budget report. I immediately, of course, phoned 
my wife, Sarah, and we had to make a decision. If this was going to be published, 
what should happen? We wanted to minimise the damage, to limit the impact of 
this, and therefore we said that if this story was to be published, then we wanted 
a statement that went to everyone that was an end to this, and there would be no 
further statements, no days and days and days of talking about the condition of our 
son.
Unfortunately, this was unacceptable to the Sun newspaper. The editor phoned our 
press office and said that this was not the way that we should go about this, and to 
be honest, if we continued to insist that we were going to make a general statement, 
the Sun wouldn’t, in future, give us any chance of advance information on any other 
story that they would do.
It  was  at  that  time  that  the  editor  of  the  Sun  phoned  my  wife,  whose  aim  then, 
having accepted that this was a fait accompli – there was no thought that the Press 
Complaints Commission could help us on this. I think we were in a different world 
then. Nobody ever expected that the Press Complaints Commission would act to give 
us any help on this, and we were presented with a fait accompli, I’m afraid. There 
was no question of us giving permission for this. There was no question of implicit or 
explicit permission.
I ask you: if any mother or any father was presented with a choice as to whether 
a four-month old son’s medical condition, your child’s medical condition, should be 
broadcast  on  the  front  page  of  a  tabloid  newspaper  and  you  had  a  choice  in  this 
matter – I don’t think there’s any parent in the land would have made the choice that 
we are told we made, to give explicit permission for that to happen. So there was no 
question ever of explicit permission.”

5.12  Mrs Brooks’ account was that the Browns, and Sarah Brown in particular, gave their consent 

to the publication of the story:92

‘‘A.  I  think  in  the  period  of  time  of  receiving  the  information  and  publishing  the 
information, which is – which, by the way, went to all newspapers – all newspapers 
published it around the same day – I spoke to the Browns. I will have spoken probably 
to  people  around  them  but  I  definitely  had  more  of  a  communication  with  Sarah 
Brown, as she was my friend, and I probably discussed it with her more. The sequence 
of events were: Fraser Brown was born in July. I think the information came to the 
Sun in the late October. I think the Browns’ position at the time was very much that 
they had had the tests confirmed, and as Prime Minister and his wife, they felt that 
there were many, many people in the UK whose children suffered with cystic fibrosis. 
They were absolutely committed to making this public and they were also – one of 
the most overwhelming memories of that time for me was the Browns’ insistence

that when the story was published, that we absolutely highlighted the positives in 
association with the cystic fibrosis association.
Q.  The story was published in November, when the child was four months old – I said 
four years old; that’s incorrect – and before, I think, the diagnosis was confirmed. Is 
that true?
A.  No. I think – and this is again from my conversations back in 2006 with the Browns 
and people who advised them – I’m pretty sure we ran the story in the November and 
the tests were confirmed some time in the October.
Q.  When you spoke to Mrs Brown – that’s your evidence,
Mrs Brooks – was it on the basis that: “Look, we’ve got this story, we’re going to run 
with it, let’s see how we can run with it in a way which is least harmful to you”, or 
something like that?
A.  Absolutely not, and I think that – as you’ve seen in my witness statement, I was 
quite friendly with Sarah Brown at the time. Very friendly. She’d been through a hell 
of a lot already. I think my first thing I would have said to both of them was – would 
have been a much more considerate and caring response to hearing the news myself. 
I was very – I was very sad for them. I didn’t know much about it and I wanted to find 
out what had gone on.
You have to remember that the – this is 2006. This is only five years later that Mr Brown 
had ever said anything – that he was in any way concerned about my behaviour, the 
behaviour of the Sun, how we handled it. Indeed, after 2006, I continued to see them 
both regularly. They held a 40th birthday celebration party for me. They attended 
my wedding. I have many letters and kind notes. Sarah and I were good friends. And 
so I felt – hence the story in the Sun in 2012 was quite tough – was that Mr Brown’s 
recollections of that time weren’t the same as my own.’’

5.13  Mrs Brooks’ testimony serves to highlight two lacunae in the evidence which renders it difficult 
for  the  Inquiry  fully  to  resolve  the  stark  evidential  dispute,  or  at  the  very  least  profound 
differences of recollection, between these two witnesses. First, Mrs Brooks stated that other 
newspapers  published  the  story  ‘around  the  same  day’.  It  is  now  clear  that  those  other 
newspapers published the story on the basis of a press release sent out by the Browns the 
night before publication in The Sun. Although Mr Brown did not give evidence in relation to 
this press release, it appears (for reasons set out in more detail below) that the Browns issued 
the press release once they realised that publication in The Sun was inevitable. Second, the 
Inquiry did not hear directly from Mrs Brown. To have required her to give evidence would 
have been a disproportionate step in all the circumstances, and the Inquiry cannot properly 
speculate as to what assistance, if any, she might have been able to give.

5.14  Mrs Brooks’ account possesses at least two surprising features. First, the claim that the Browns 
were ‘absolutely committed to making this public’ frankly defies belief: one hardly needs Mr 
Brown himself to point out that no parent in the land would have wanted information of this 
nature to be blazoned across the front page of a national newspaper. On the other hand, if 
the complaint is well founded, the fact that the Browns appeared to have remained friendly 
with Mrs Brooks after November 2006 is itself somewhat surprising. Mr Brown’s explanation, 
that his wife ‘is one of the most forgiving people I know’,93 may indeed be correct (and I do

be. Interestingly, Mr Brown went on immediately to say that ‘we had to get on with the job

of  doing  what  people  expect  a  politician  to  do,  to  run  a  government’:94  this  itself  throws 
much light on the relationship between the press and politicians, with its implication that the 
imperative of continuing to ‘get on with’ NI was abiding.

It  is  possible  to  reconcile  this  apparent  conflict  of  evidence  without  concluding  that  any 
witness sought deliberately to mislead the Inquiry. Mr Brown’s evidence was assuredly right 
when he said that he and his wife felt that they were being presented with a fait accompli. A 
journalist, and not Mrs Brooks, had telephoned his press office with the news that The Sun 
was going to publish this story; or, putting the matter at its lowest, this was the inference 
which the press office drew. From their own previous experience or knowledge of the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press, the Browns now perceived that this was now a matter of 
damage limitation, and they sought to come to an arrangement with The Sun on that basis. 
Clearly, the Browns did not believe that they could persuade The Sun or its editor to take a 
different course altogether, otherwise they would have tried to do so. Some of the detail of 
Mr Brown’s account could not be put to Mrs Brooks when she testified, because it simply was 
not available at that stage. What is clear is that Mrs Brooks telephoned Mrs Brown and each 
believed at the end of that conversation that a concordat had been reached: Mrs Brown, 
because she had no option; and Mrs Brooks, because the Browns did not explicitly oppose 
the publication of the story.

5.16  Mrs Brooks is to be criticised in two interconnected respects, but only to the extent necessary 
to address the culture, practices and ethics of the press. I do not find (as Mrs Brooks asserted) 
that the Browns were absolutely committed to making the fact of their four month old son’s 
illness public, nor do I accept that their press release the night before publication evidences 
that fact. However, it should be made clear that I am not thereby holding that Mrs Brooks 
deliberately misled the Inquiry. Mrs Brown is highly unlikely to have said anything expressly 
along the lines that she was “absolutely committed” to making the fact of their son’s illness 
public,  and  insofar  as  Mrs  Brooks  drew  that  inference  from  Mrs  Brown’s  acquiescence  or 
failure to remonstrate, she is guilty of a degree of blinkeredness if not self persuasion. Had 
she stopped to place herself in Mrs Brown’s situation, she would have begun to understand 
the predicament in which she had been placed. In all the circumstances, Mrs Brooks should 
have asked a series of direct questions of Mrs Brown to satisfy herself that consent was fully 
and freely given, and should have given her the express option of vetoing publication.

5.17 

In  the  result,  the  Browns  managed  the  revelation  of  the  information  via  their  own  press 
release, the story was subsequently published in a way which placed the Brown family in 
a sympathetic light, and The Sun had its front page. The Browns had been presented with 
Hobson’s choice, and they took the line of least resistance. In that way they avoided both the 
risk of The Sun publishing an account to which they had not contributed, and the possible 
political fallout with NI which might have ensued had they strenuously objected.

5.18  The fact that Mrs Brooks might well not have published this story in The Sun had the Browns 
expressly asked her not to do so does not reflect badly on her, but speaks volumes for the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press. In this particular instance, she held all the reins of 
power, and the Browns held none; to the extent that they felt that could not even ask Mrs 
Brooks to back off.

5.19  Further,  this  form  of  fait  accompli  is  a  familiar  one  to  this  Inquiry.  The  Brown’s  evidence 
strikes concordant notes with the evidence of witnesses such as Ms Diamond and the singer, 
Charlotte Church, to name but two.

False smear

5.20  The article published in The Sun on 13 July 201195 commenced with this sentence:

‘The  Sun  today  exposes  the  allegation  that  we  hacked  into  Mr  Brown’s  medical 
records as FALSE and a smear’.

5.21  Unsurprisingly, given that similar language had been used by another newspaper in November 
2011 and this was still fresh in the Inquiry’s mind,96 I pursued a line of questioning with Mrs 
Brooks on this matter:97

‘‘LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Now, my question. Would you look, please, at the first line 
of the Sun article: “The Sun today exposes the allegation that we hacked into Gordon 
Brown’s family medical records as false and a smear.” My concern is whether it’s fair 
to describe that as – it may be incorrect, but as “false and a smear”.
A.  In the general point, I can absolutely see what you’re saying, sir, is correct, but 
this was not – this was a particular journey that the Sun had been involved in since 
the beginning of the information coming into the Sun newsroom and what happened 
after that and subsequent to that.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But if he never knew how you got it, all you can say – and 
you’re entitled to say, “He’s just got it wrong.”
A.  He came to the wrong assumption in 2011.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: And that’s absolutely fair. So the issue is whether it’s part 
of the culture of the press that actually attack is the best form of defence. So people 
don’t just get it wrong; it’s “false”, in capitals, and “a smear”. Do you see the point 
I’m making?
A.  I do see the point you’re making, but, sir, the context of that article was written 
after Gordon Brown had – first of all, I think his first appearance in Parliament since 
he stepped down as Prime Minister was to come to the House and speak incredibly 
critically and, in some cases, made wrong assumptions through his testimony to the 
House, and then the second thing he did, he then went on, I think, the BBC – I can’t 
remember – to do an interview with another wrong assumption that the Sun had got 
the story from [the child’s] medical records, and I think combining the two, if you like, 
attacks from Mr Brown that had never ever been raised by him in any shape or form 
with any of us at News International or Mr Murdoch – he never once mentioned press 
ethics or practices in his – in our entire relationship – that the Sun felt that it was a 
smear, that he was doing it five years later for a particular reason, and I think that’s 
why they wrote the story that they did. Now, I was chief executive at the time. I didn’t 
write the story but I’m defending their right to write the story like that.
LORD  JUSTICE  LEVESON:  All  right.  You’ve  provided  an  answer,  but  actually  what 
you’ve demonstrated is that the Sun believed – and they may be right or wrong, I 
don’t know – that Mr Brown had added two and two and two and got 27, whereas in 
fact, if you took each one of the incidents on their own, it may have been he may have

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicmade a mistake, he may be wrong to reach the conclusion – that’s all fair enough, 
entirely proper, but it goes a bit further than that.
A.  I accept that this story does, but if you imagine for the Sun, the Sun – and I know I 
keep mentioning this, but the Sun has a trust with its readership.’’

5.22  Ultimately, the issue for Mrs Brooks was the reputation of The Sun in the eyes of its readers. 
This struck another chord, in that in a different context (the pursuit of campaigns) Mrs Brooks 
stated that all that The Sun did was to reflect the viewpoint of its readers. In other words, 
editors and journalists are mere reflectors of public opinion rather than the drivers of it, and 
the readers are always the pre-eminent concern. Mrs Brooks discountenanced the suggestion 
that by criticising Mr Brown in this way the paper was unnecessarily raising the temperature 
and indulging in an exercise in ‘aggressive defence’; she could understand the point that was 
being put to her, but could not begin to see the issue from Mr Brown’s perspective, instead 
preferring to defend the paper’s right to publish this type of story.

5.23  The parallels with the ‘mendacious smear’ story98 and other evidence referred to below,99 are 

obvious.

The aftermath of Mr Brown’s evidence to the Inquiry

5.24  On 25 June 2012 Linklaters on behalf of NI wrote to the Inquiry drawing its attention to an 

article in The Sunday Post (a newspaper published in Dundee) on 17 June which stated:

‘The  Sunday  Post  heard  about  the  baby’s  condition  weeks  before  they  [sic]  were 
published in The Sun. We contacted the Browns, and they told us that they did not 
want to comment. We respected their privacy, and didn’t print the story. Remember 
that not all newspapers are the same.’

5.25  Rather than draw attention to the way in which The Sunday Post sought to distance itself 
from the conduct of The Sun newspaper, as well as to the fact that the Brown family’s ‘no 
comment’ is hardly consistent with Mrs Brooks’ evidence that they were absolutely committed 
to broadcasting their son’s condition, the point Linklaters made was that Mr Brown’s evidence 
to the effect that ‘there were only a few people, medical people, who knew that our son had 
this condition’ must be incorrect. Linklaters asked the Inquiry to obtain further evidence from 
The Sunday Post and Mr Brown relating to this issue.

5.26  On 28 June 2012 The Times published a short piece which reported on Linklaters’ request to 
the Inquiry, and referred to Mr Brown’s claim that The Sun had ‘illegally obtained information 
from his son’s medical records’.

5.27  However, on Wednesday 2 July The Times felt constrained to publish an apology in these 

terms:

‘The Sunday Post has now explained it did not know that the baby had, or was being 
tested for, cystic fibrosis. And we accept that Mr Brown’s evidence to the Leveson 
Inquiry was not as we described it: he told the Inquiry that he had been told by the 
Fife Health Board it was ‘highly likely’ that the information about his son’s condition 
originated  from  an  NHS  staff  member.  We  are  happy  to  clarify  the  position  and 
apologise to the Brown family.’

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesF5.28  Although  the  Inquiry  accepts  the  explanation  given  in  the  third  witness  statement  of  Pia 
Sarma, editorial legal director at the Times Newspapers Limited, dated 3 September 2012 
that facts set out in the article in The Times dated 28 June 2012 were themselves obtained 
from information supplied by The Sunday Post, it is clear that the author of that article had 
misread Mr Brown’s evidence to this Inquiry. Others have suggested that on this occasion The 
Times demonstrated a lack of objectivity borne out of its desire to protect another NI title: this 
is certainly a possible inference, but would require more specific evidence to substantiate.

5.29  Considering the episode as a whole, the treatment of Mr and Mrs Brown by NI left much to 
be desired. It cannot be equated with the treatment experienced by the McCanns, Dowlers 
or Mr Jefferies, but, as a whole, the experience of the Browns provides a fine example of 
a  number  of  aspects  of  unsatisfactory  and/or  unethical  press  practices  further  examined 
below.100

6.  hugh Grant and ‘the mendacious smear’
6.1 

Hugh Grant was one of the first witnesses to give evidence before the Inquiry in November 
2011. At paragraph 11 of his first witness statement he referred to an article published in 
the  Mail  on  Sunday  on  18  February  2007.101  The  article  speculated  that  the  cause  of  the 
breakdown  of  Mr  Grant’s  long  term  relationship  with  Jemima  Khan  was  a  series  of  late-
night phone calls with a ‘glamorous young Cambridge-educated film executive from Warner 
Brothers’ with a ‘plummy-voice’. The article continued:

‘a  source  revealed  last  night...Hugh  was  always  disappearing  for  meetings  and 
whenever  he  was  on  the  phone  to  this  woman,  Jemima  would  hear  her  plummy 
laughter. She would always call Hugh on his mobile, but Hugh would tell Jemima the 
woman was calling to discuss the movie. Then he’d switch his phone off. Jemima has 
been very upset about it...’

6.2 

This article was defamatory of Mr Grant, and he successfully brought proceedings for libel 
against the publishers. According to his first witness statement,102 the woman in question was 
an assistant to an executive at a film company associated with Warners. She was middle-aged, 
happily married, and never had been a girlfriend of Mr Grant. She left voicemail messages on 
Mr Grant’s phone, and these were ‘plummy-voiced and sometimes jokey’.

6.3  Mr Grant had not suggested in the libel action that Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL) may 
have hacked into his mobile phone. At that stage his only concern was likely to have been his 
cause of action in the tort of defamation, and, in 2007, the issue of phone hacking had not 
achieved the level of prominence that it was subsequently to acquire. Paragraph 11 of Mr 
Grant’s first witness statement concluded with this sentence:103

‘We know from Paul Dacre’s assertions that the Mail papers have never based stories 
on intercepted phone messages, so the source of the story remains a great mystery’

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public6.4 

Although  Mr  Grant  was  of  course  not  directly  accusing  the  Mail  papers  of  hacking  into 
his phone, that he was lightly hinting at such a possibility was not lost on the Inquiry. It is 
worthwhile setting out the relevant part of Mr Grant’s oral evidence in full:104

‘‘Q.  Are you suggesting there that the story must have come from phone hacking?
A.  Well, what I say in this paragraph is that the Mail on Sunday ran an article in 
February 2007 saying that my relationship with my then girlfriend, Jemima Khan, was 
on the rocks because of my persistent late-night flirtatious phonecalls with a plummy-
voiced studio executive from Warner Brothers, and it was a bizarre story, completely 
untrue, that I sued for libel over and won and damages were awarded, a statement 
was made in open court. But thinking about how they could possibly come up with 
such a bizarre left-field story, I realised that although there was no plummy-voiced 
studio executive from Warner Brothers with whom I’d had any kind of relationship, 
flirtatious or otherwise, there was a great friend of mine in Los Angeles who runs a 
production company which is associated with Warner Brothers and whose assistant 
is a charming married middle-aged lady, English, who, as happens in Hollywood, is 
the person who rings you. The executive never rings you. It’s always their assistant: 
“Hi, we have Jack Bealy(?) on the phone for you.” And this is what she used to do. 
She used to call and she used to leave messages and because she was a nice English 
girl in LA, sometimes when we spoke, we’d have a chat about English stuff, Marmite 
or whatever. So she would leave charming, jokey messages saying, “Please call this 
studio executive back”, and she has a voice that could only be described as plummy. 
So I cannot for the life of me think of any conceivable source for this story in the Mail 
on Sunday except those voice messages on my mobile telephone.
Q.  You haven’t alleged that before, have you, in the public domain?
A.  No, but when I was preparing this statement and going through all my old trials 
and tribulations with the press, I looked at that one again and thought that is weird, 
and then the penny dropped.
Q.  I think the highest it can be put is, frankly, it’s a piece of speculation on your part, 
isn’t it, in relation to this?
A.  Yes, you could – yes, speculation, okay, but I would love to know – I mean, I think 
Mr Caplan, who represents Associated, was saying earlier today that he’d like to put 
in a supplementary statement and – you know, referring to the things I say today. 
Well, I’d love to hear what the Daily Mail’s or the Sunday Mail’s explanation for that 
article is, what that source was, if it wasn’t phone hacking.’’

6.5 

Taking Mr Grant’s evidence as a whole, it is reasonable to conclude that he freely accepted 
Counsel’s suggestion that he was speculating as to the source of the article, yet was seeking 
an explanation from ANL as to the circumstances in which the article came to be published 
in the Mail on Sunday. This conclusion is entirely supported by paragraph 17 of Mr Grant’s 
second supplementary witness statement, where he said this:105

‘Nevertheless I accepted entirely that this was of course speculation on my part as 
only the newspaper has the documents or evidence on which the story was prepared. 
I never saw any in the legal proceedings.’

573

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesF6.6  Mr Grant’s evidence attracted a lot of media publicity, not least because he had covered a 
range of issues and this has been the first day of the evidence sessions of the Inquiry. Paul 
Dacre, the editor-in-chief of all the ANL titles and the editor of the Daily Mail, heard a report 
of Mr Grant’s evidence on the 16:00hrs radio news. Again, it is worthwhile setting out the 
whole of the relevant section of his oral evidence to the Inquiry:106

‘‘A.  Can  I  explain  the  circumstances  of  that?  I  was  off  that  day  on  an  outside 
appointment. Not off; out of the office on an outside appointment, and I was driving 
back  and  the  4  o’clock  news  came  on  the  BBC  and  the  headline  was  as  followed: 
“Another major newspaper group has been dragged into the phone hacking scandal. 
Actor Hugh Grant has accused the Mail on Sunday – Associated Newspapers’ Mail on 
Sunday of hacking phones.” It was a terrible smear on a company I love. We had to do 
something about it. I discussed with the Mail on Sunday’s editor what our response 
was.  A  long  convoluted  press  statement  was  being  prepared.  I  was  deeply  aware 
– and he was deeply aware – that you  had to rebut such a damaging,  damaging 
allegation, and we agreed on the form of words: “It was a mendacious smear.” Let me 
explain why I feel it was a mendacious smear. You will have read – you have already 
interviewed our legal director on this for a considerable amount of time. Our witness 
statements have made clear that Associated is not involved in phone hacking and 
we’ve denied phone hacking in this instance, anyway, specifically.’’

6.7 

The ‘form of words’ which Mr Dacre was referring to appeared on page 11 of the Daily Mail 
published on the day after Mr Grant testified, that is to say on 22 November 2011. It read:

F

‘The Mail on Sunday utterly refutes Hugh Grant’s claim that they got any story as 
a result of phone hacking. In fact, in the case of the story Mr Grant refers to, the 
information came from a freelance journalist who had been told by a source who was 
regularly speaking to Jemima Khan. Mr Grant’s allegations are mendacious smears 
driven by his hatred of the media.’

6.8 

6.9 

The Inquiry is only concerned for present purposes with the final sentence of this extract from 
the Daily Mail and the reference to ‘mendacious smears’. Unsurprisingly, the protagonists to 
this dispute were concerned to seek to persuade the Inquiry to investigate whether or not Mr 
Grant had been the victim of voicemail hacking. Dealing with the rebuttal, Mr Grant submitted 
a witness statement from Ms Khan which emphatically contradicted the suggestion that she 
had been speaking to a source: she said that the first she knew any “plummy-voiced” woman 
calling Mr Grant, or anything similar, was when she read it in the Mail on Sunday.107

ANL, on the other hand, placed before the Inquiry material which sought to indicate that Mr 
Grant’s speculations were both illogical and without evidential basis.108 Although the Inquiry 
tested Liz Hartley, the head of editorial legal services at ANL, on her supplemental statement 
and permitted some limited cross examination of Mr Dacre by Mr Sherborne, it is unnecessary 
for this evidence to be analysed in this Report. For reasons discussed below, I do not accept 
the propositions advanced by ANL but it is very important also to make it clear that neither do 
I conclude that the Mail on Sunday or any journalist employed by it knowingly used material

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicfor this story which had been sourced by phone hacking: equally to be fair, Mr Sherborne on 
behalf of Mr Grant did not contend that I should.

6.10  Given the specific nature of the Inquiry’s concern, further questions were asked of Mr Dacre 
in order to establish whether he knew exactly what Mr Grant had claimed in evidence before 
the Mail’s rebuttal went out. Mr Dacre said this:109

‘‘LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: But did you ask precisely what Mr Grant had said?
A.  Yes, of course. I had that because I was in liaison with the office.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: So you knew that the headline did not reflect what he’d said?
A.  Yes,  but  that  –  the  damage  was  being  done  and  I’m  glad  to  say  that  once  we 
got our statement out, we had a much, much more balanced reporting of it by the 
BBC  and  other  media.  But  if  that  had  been  allowed  to  stand,  it  would  have  been 
devastating for our reputation.
MR JAY: I just wonder, Mr Dacre, whether you didn’t shoot from the hip a little but too 
fast on this occasion.
A.  Not at all. It needed rebutting instantly. This is how modern communications work. 
It is my view that Mr Grant made that statement on the opening day of the court 
– Hacked Off, the organisation backed by the Media Standards Trust, attempted to 
hijack your Inquiry with that highly calculated attempt to wound my company, and I -
Q.  I’m not altogether clear, Mr Dacre, whether you’re saying that Mr Grant perjured 
himself. That’s what “mendacious smears” might suggest.
A.  I’m not going to go into that area. I’ve tried to tell you the context of why we had 
to rebut this. I mean, let me say as clearly and as slowly as I can: I have never placed 
a story in the Daily Mail as a result of phone hacking that I knew came from phone 
hacking. I know of no cases of phone hacking. Having conducted a major internal 
enquiry, I’m as confident as I can be that there’s no phone hacking on the Daily Mail. 
I don’t make that statement lightly, and no editor, the editor of the Guardian or the 
Independent, could say otherwise. I’m prepared to make this – I will withdraw that 
statement if Mr Grant withdraws his statements that the Daily Mail and the Mail on 
Sunday were involved in phone hacking.
Q.  I’m not sure I’m in a position to broker a deal between you, but can I just ask this, 
Mr Dacre: why didn’t you come back, as it were, in the measured way you’re coming 
to this Inquiry and then just say –
A.  I’ve tried to explain – sorry.
Q.  And then say at the end:
“In the circumstances, Mr Grant is incorrect.”
A.  Because then it would have been too late.’’

6.11  As I have already indicated, I make it clear that I accept Mr Dacre’s evidence that he never 
placed a story in the Daily Mail (or permitted one to be placed) which he knew came from 
phone hacking. That said, he did not engage with Counsel’s question that the use of the term 
‘mendacious smears’ might amount to an allegation that Mr Grant had committed perjury. 
The various written submissions of ANL maintained that the adjective ‘mendacious’ possesses

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFF

a  number  of  possible  meanings,  and  argued  that  the  term  taken  in  context  and  properly 
understood  in  law  amounts  to  nothing  more  than  ‘honest  comment’.  In  my  judgment, 
however, reading the article in the manner in which I have been invited, the Daily Mail was 
accusing Mr Grant of lying. Mr Grant would only be lying if, in speculating as he did, he did 
not believe that his evidence had any foundation.

6.12  However, equally in my judgment, in making that accusation the Daily Mail was increasing the 
temperature and went too far. The ‘plummy-voiced’ executive, apart from apparently being 
young, glamorous and Cambridge educated, was described in the article in the Mail on Sunday 
in particular by reference to the quality of her voice, as apparently discerned by someone 
hearing it on Mr Grant’s mobile phone. Mr Grant knew that a lady with a voice which could 
reasonably be described in this way had left voicemail messages. From his own perspective, 
he also knew that the claim made in the article that he discussed this lady’s phone calls with 
Ms Khan was incorrect (at the time he gave his evidence, he did not have Ms Khan’s witness 
statement which further contradicted one important evidential plank on which the article was 
founded). He also knew that the lady in question was, with respect to her, middle aged rather 
than ‘young’, and he might well have believed that the references to her glamour and being 
Cambridge educated were poetic licence on the part of the newspaper. It follows, viewing the 
matter solely from Mr Grant’s perspective, that there was some basis for his concern (which 
in answer to a leading question he accepted was speculation) that an individual had listened 
to the contents of his voicemails. This person was, of course, not necessarily the ‘source’ 
referred to in the article, but could equally easily have been someone who had spoken to the 
source about the story without identifying how the information became available.

6.13  Mr  Dacre  accepted  that  his  principal  objective  shortly  after  16:00hrs  on  21  November 
2011 was to get out a strongly worded denial which would safeguard the reputation of his 
newspapers. However, in so doing he acted precipitately, in particular in failing to ascertain 
exactly what Mr Grant had said when he testified. His explanation that further inquiry along 
those lines would have meant that the response of the Mail titles would have been ‘too late’ 
does not justify the aggressive line which was adopted in defence of its position. A response 
which defended the Mail’s position in regard to phone hacking and stating words to the effect 
that  Mr  Grant’s  speculation  was  just  wrong,  while  robustly  defending  the  Mail’s  position, 
would have achieved the same outcome without the accusation of perjury.

6.14  Of course, Mr Dacre was perfectly entitled to decide what he wanted to put in the paper 
for which he had ultimate editorial control. He is entitled to challenge my view (as he has in 
robust and trenchant terms). As far as I am concerned, however, the point of this case study 
is that it is a good example of the phenomenon of ‘aggressive defence’ identified above.110

The accident
At 21:15hrs on Tuesday 13 March 2012, a road traffic accident occurred in a motorway tunnel 
near Sierre, Switzerland, when a coach returning school children from a skiing trip to their 
homes in Lommel and Heverlee, Belgium, struck a brick wall. 28 people, including 22 children, 
lost their lives. It was a devastating tragedy of unimaginable proportions which, beyond the 
immediate traumatic effect upon families, relatives, friends and everyone touched by it, will 
have undeniably affected the lives of a very substantial number of people either forever or for

The story is relevant to the work of the Inquiry not simply because of the way in which it 
has been reported in the press and the extent to which the press intruded into the grief of 
the family but also because all this happened while the Inquiry was underway, immediately 
after  evidence  about  intrusive  reporting  which  was  to  similar  effect  had  been  given.  It  is 
also important because it demonstrates the work done by the PCC in circulating member 
organisations about the concerns of the family; it equally highlights the unreality of a system 
that depends solely on complaints as a trigger therefore ignoring (and, thus, appearing to 
condone) potentially significant breaches of the Editors’ Code.

Press activity

7.3  Mr and Mrs Bowles learnt about the accident in the early hours of the following morning and 
Mr Bowles travelled to Switzerland by the first available flight. That afternoon, he learnt that 
Sebastian had not survived and he was joined by his wife and their nine year old daughter at 
the Hotel Des Vignes which had been designated by the Swiss authorities as the centre for 
parents with children involved in the crash. In the morning of 15 March, with other families, 
the three of them were taken to the scene of the crash. Although press photographers had 
not been permitted onto the hotel property (and coaches had been placed in front of the gate 
to obstruct the view and line of sight), they were photographed from a distance with neither 
their knowledge nor their consent while they waited under the porch of the hotel to get on 
the coach that would transport them to the scene. On 16 March, one of these photographs 
of the Bowles family (including Sebastian’s younger sister, obviously grieving) was published 
in the Daily Mail.111

7.4 

16 March saw the publication of a great deal of other material. Prior to the trip, a website 
had  been  set  up  as  a  blog  so  that  the  children  on  the  trip  could  send  messages  to  their 
families, sharing their experiences both in writing and by photographs. The website was not 
password protected and thus was open to anyone but it was obviously intended to provide a 
mechanism for personal communication. It included a photograph of Sebastian in his skiing 
outfit; this photograph soon appeared on The Sun website; a representative of Mr Bowles’ 
employers contacted The Sun requesting that no photographs be published and (when told 
that it had been put on the website) asked that it should not be reproduced in print. However, 
no attention was paid to this request and the photograph was carried on the front page. In 
addition, the paper quoted comments and salutations written by Sebastian, clearly intended 
to be personal but which had formed part of his daily postings to his family.

7.5 

Besides  printing  the  photograph  from  outside  the  Hotel  des  Vignes,  the  Daily  Mail  also 
published the photograph in skiing clothes and quoted from his blog (described as “an online 
message to his parents”). The Daily Telegraph also published the blog and the photograph 
from it. The immediate result was that the website had to be taken down although the record 
has been preserved for the families.

7.6 

In the meantime, what was described as ‘packs of press’ descended on the Bowles family 
homes  in  London  and  Belgium,  making  enquiries  in  the  area.  In  Belgium,  the  problem 
became sufficiently acute that the police had to be called (and had to return every half hour). 

111 in order to protect the privacy of the Bowles family to such extent as is possible, and notwithstanding the fact that 
the information is, at least to a large extent, in the public domain and available, this Report will not publish references 
to their names, the precise articles or photographs or other family details

577

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFPerhaps more understandably, but notwithstanding requests to be left alone (not the least 
being from the representative of Mr Bowles’ employers), British and other journalists politely 
approached them (once with flowers, sometimes apologetically) but all were then prepared 
to reduce their requests into writing and did so.

7.7  More was to come. Mr Bowles had a Facebook site which he believes had a privacy setting 
‘friends only’ on which he had published personal, family photographs to share with his family 
and friends. On 17 March, a number of these photographs appeared on The Mail Online: Mr 
Bowles had not given permission (not would he have given permission) for what he described 
as photographs of an “obviously private, personal and family nature” to be published. These 
photographs  caused  him  to  contact  Giles  Crown,  a  friend  who  is  also  a  media  lawyer.  He 
spoke to the PCC whose on duty representative was sympathetic and asked him to put his 
concerns into writing; Mr Crown then wrote to the various editors (copied to the PCC) that 
afternoon.

7.8

7.9 

The letter made it clear that Mr and Mrs Bowles “sincerely wish to be left to grieve the death 
of their son in peace without media intrusion” and referred to various clauses of the Editors’ 
Code;  particular  emphasis  could  be  placed  on  clauses  3(i)  (privacy),  3(iii)  (photographs  in 
private places), 5(i) (intrusion into grief), 6(ii) (photographs of children without consent). The 
letter asked that the privacy of a memorial service be respected and that all private photographs 
be removed from all media websites; although without limitation, this particularly referred to 
the taking or publication of photographs of Sebastian’s younger sister. The letter suggested 
that human decency, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the 
PCC Code all demanded that the privacy of the family be respected.

There was no immediate response from the Daily Mail but a follow up email on 18 March 
(Sunday) elicited a reply on 20 March to the effect that the photographs had been taken from 
the Facebook page on the Friday without permission but that they were “openly accessible” 
and that, as the privacy settings had been increased, they would be removed. The photograph 
taken at the Hotel des Vignes of three members of the Bowles family (notwithstanding that 
one of them was clearly a child) had not been removed by the time that Mr Crown’s statement 
was circulated to Core Participants. The Daily Mail now explains that the photograph had been 
obtained from a respectable picture agency (which it believed should have asked itself the 
correct questions) and that they were not aware that the photograph included Sebastian’s 
sister who was not identified in the caption, although she had, in fact, been cropped out of 
another photograph.

7.10  The Sun similarly referred to the fact that the photograph from the online blog had been 
distributed  by  picture  agencies  and  was  clearly  available  which  is  why  they  considered  it 
appropriate to publish it. By the time that Mr Crown spoke to the editor of the Daily Telegraph 
(who knew family and had been a fellow school governor with Mrs Bowles) he was told that 
he was “late to the party” and that he had held off publishing because he knew Mr Bowles 
although it was legitimate to publish a photograph that was in the public domain and had 
been taken in a public place.

7.11 

It was not only the press in the UK that published material of which complaint is made; Mr 
Crown has learnt that the Belgian Journalists’ Council (Raad) is investigating certain aspects 
of the reporting of the incident by the Belgian media particularly in relation to “people in 
vulnerable positions, such as minors and victims and their families” and that “any identification 
must be weighed against the social importance of reporting”.

578

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public7.12  Mr Bowles is the first to recognise that the accident was a tragedy of national significance 
in Belgium and Switzerland; he had no objection to extensive media coverage of it and that 
Sebastian’s nationality provided an obvious focus for the UK press. His objection has been to 
the personal nature of the coverage and the intrusion.

7.13  The way in which this story was reported undeniably raises issues under the Editors’ Code in 
relation to privacy, the discretion surrounding the reporting of grief and shock (particularly in 
relation to the reporting and photographing of such grief in children) and the extent to which 
it is appropriate to publish photographs or material such as that trawled from the school trip 
website which one would have thought would obviously not have been intended for public 
consumption. This raises the question of who should be considering these issues, the value 
of a complaint (the damage having been done and no regret being sufficient to remove the 
additional impact that the press coverage had) and the need for an enunciation of standards.

7.14  Although I might have a clear view, I do not think it would assist if I sought to take the place of 
a regulator in this very topical case although it certainly says something about the practices 
of the press. The most important point, however, is that it is not in the least surprising that 
Mr Bowles does not pursue a complaint; his focus remains on the loss of his son. The matter 
was put clearly by Mr Crown in these terms:112

“I would just like to try and make clear that [the Bowles] family have no wish to have 
a  fight  with  the  media  in  any  sense.  They  gave  evidence  reluctantly  because  they 
felt it was the right thing to do. They are disappointed that with regard to such an 
immense tragedy they would have expected some greater restraint from the media 
in the way the tragedy was reported and in [Mr Bowles’] view that wasn’t the case.
Just to emphasise, their over-riding desire [is] that their privacy is maintained as it is 
still, as you will understand, a very recent event and additional publicity at this point 
would greatly aggravate the family’s [grieving].”

7.15  As much as any of the stories covered by this Report, this account underlines the very real 
dilemma faced by the press when balancing the respect that is owed to those who suffer 
almost unimaginable personal tragedy with which, in some way, they have to come to terms, 
and the legitimate public interest in an incident that has significance for everyone. I repeat 
the  proposition  that  if  nobody  will  review  editorial  decisions  in  the  absence  of  a  formal 
complaint, (that would require energy to deal with by someone who has far greater issues to 
have to confront it), is, in my view, a serious lacuna in our approach to the maintenance of 
standards.

8.  recent events: royal photographs
8.1 

At the conclusion of the hearings on 24 July 2012, I repeated that I would not hesitate to 
ventilate anything that happened over the months prior to publication of the Report, which 
I felt impacted on the work of the Inquiry. In the event, there have been a large number of 
stories which warrant attention and justify consideration as part of the Terms of Reference. 
On the basis that I have decided that it is not necessary or appropriate to hold further hearings 
or seek further submissions (save in response to letters issued under Rule 13 of the Inquiry 
Rules 2006), I do not intend to refer to most other than to comment that the argument that 
the Inquiry has had a chilling effect on journalism does not appear to have been borne out.

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFThere  are,  however,  two  stories  that  are  of  such  importance,  or  such  value  to  the  Terms 
of Reference of the Inquiry, they must be addressed in some detail even though the latter 
reveals no impropriety on the part of the UK press.

8.5 

HRH Prince Henry of Wales
The first story that requires attention is the recent publicity surrounding the behaviour of HRH 
Prince Henry of Wales (Prince Harry), a 28 year old army officer and third in line to the throne.

It  is  unnecessary  to  rehearse  the  circumstances  in  which,  following  the  death  of  Diana, 
Princess  of  Wales  in  a  road  traffic  accident  (which  occurred  while  she  was  followed  by 
paparazzi photographers), the press agreed to respect the privacy of Prince Harry and his 
elder brother during their school years. It is equally unnecessary to outline the various stories 
that have been printed about him thereafter; nobody could suggest that he was not a public 
figure and there is no doubt that his conduct has and can legitimately generate questions 
the discussion of which is entirely in the public interest. The issues which recent events have 
revealed  concern  the  extent  to  which  he  is  entitled  to  any  private  life  or  privacy  and  the 
impact of publication of photographs on the internet.

Having received plaudits for his work during the course of The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and 
as an Olympic Ambassador, during August 2012, while on leave, Prince Harry went on holiday 
to a resort in Las Vegas; as usual, he was accompanied by personal protection officers. During 
the  course  of  the  holiday,  on  21  August,  he  invited  a  group  into  the  apartment  which  he 
occupied and, in their presence, is said to have played a game of “strip billiards”. However it 
arose, at least two photographs were taken of him naked, one of which showed him shielding 
a  naked  girl  and  another  embracing  the  girl.  The  photographs  are  reported  to  have  been 
taken on a mobile phone.

The photographs were quickly sold to an American website TMZ.com and put on the internet; 
they  were  also  published  by  the  blogger  Paul  Staines  on  his  Guido  Fawkes  blog  based  in 
Ireland. Equally quickly, contact was made by or on behalf of St James’s Palace (for the Prince) 
with the PCC; this was followed up by a letter dated 22 August 2012, requesting circulation to 
managing editors so that the position of the palace was clear. The PCC circulated the letter, 
quoting the concern expressed but without commenting upon it. In the light of what followed 
it is important to set out what it says in detail:

F

“As we understand the position following a telephone call to St James’s Palace this 
afternoon, a number of British newspapers have jointly purchased the photographs 
and have served notice of their intention to publish them both on-line and in their 
newspapers. They have asked what the reaction of St. James’s Palace would be to 
such behaviour on their part.
As we have already discussed with you, the photographs in question were taken on an 
entirely private occasion and in those circumstances there was a more than reasonable 
expectation of privacy. No matter of public interest (as those words are understood 
in English law) is raised by these photographs. The fact that they have appeared in 
another jurisdiction is meaningless. The only possible reason for publication of the 
photographs is prurience and nothing more. As such any publication would be a clear 
breach of Clause 3 of the PCC Code. We should be grateful if you would circulate this 
letter to the relevant managing editors of your members so that they are fully aware 
of St James’s Palace’s position and the fact that they entirely reserve their rights as to 
any further steps that they may take should publication take place.”

580

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public8.6 

On  23  August,  the  entire  British  press  respected  the  wishes  of  St  James’s  Palace  and  the 
photographs  were  not  published.  However,  The  Sun  created  a  mock  up  of  one  of  the 
photographs,  using  its  picture  editor  and  a  21  year  old  undertaking  work  experience  on 
its  fashion  desk  (also  described  as  an  intern),  both  of  whom,  the  caption  reported,  were 
“happy to strip” although the image, which had also been placed on its website, was later 
removed.113 Many newspapers blamed the effect of this Inquiry when asked why they did not 
print the photographs. Later that day, The Sun changed its mind and, in a mood described 
in The Sunday Times as ‘jubilant’, uploaded the images onto its website and published the 
photographs (one of which was on the front page) the following day.

8.7  When the decision had been made David Dinsmore, the interim managing editor of The Sun, 
wrote to Lord Hunt, the Chairman of the PCC, to the effect that it was becoming “increasingly 
perverse not to publish the pictures”. The Sun published its own account of its reasons. Other 
titles joined the debate and were, in the main, supportive of The Sun; it is unnecessary to 
consider any but The Sunday Times. In the absence of any formal complaint from the Prince, 
the PCC has chosen to do nothing, explaining why it had taken that course. Each of these 
arguments repays detailed analysis not least for their failure to deal with the other side of the 
case which, however partisan the press is entitled to be, raises important issues for debate. 
The purpose of putting the argument is to ensure that the public have a fuller account of the 
competing arguments than might be received simply by reading the newspapers.

The Editors’ Code of Practice

8.8 

Before  going  to  the  detailed  arguments,  it  is  worth  setting  out  the  relevant  terms  of  the 
Editors’ Code of Practice, drawn up by editors and agreed by those who subscribe to the PCC 
(including The Sun). Paragraph 3 (headed Privacy) provides:

i  Everyone  is  entitled  to  respect  for  his  or  her  private  and  family  life,  home, 

health and correspondence including digital communications.

ii  Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual’s private life 
without  consent.  Account  will  be  taken  of  the  complainant’s  own  public 
disclosures of information.
It  is  unacceptable  to  photograph  individuals  in  private  places  without  their 
consent.

iii 

Note: Private places are public or private property where there is a reasonable 
expectation of privacy.
There is an exception to this provision where the publication can be demonstrated 
to be in the public interest. That is defined in this way:
1.  The public interest includes, but is not confined to: (i) detecting or exposing 
crime  or  serious  impropriety.  (ii)  Protecting  public  health  and  safety.  (iii) 
Preventing  the  public  from  being  misled  by  an  action  or  statement  of  an 
individual or organisation.

2.  There is a public interest in freedom of expression itself.

113 Both the picture editor and the work experience intern were perfectly entitled to pose for this photograph if they 
wished: given the likely anxiety that a 21 year old girl on work experience might have to secure full time employment, 
the fact that she was asked or permitted to do so raises issues not dissimilar to those discussed in Part F Chapter 6 
relating to pressure on staff

581

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesF3.  Whenever  the  public  interest  is  invoked,  the  PCC  will  require  editors  to 
demonstrate fully that they reasonably believed that publication, or journalistic 
activity undertaken with a view to publication, would be in the public interest 
and how, and with whom, that was established at the time.

4.  The  PCC  will  consider  the  extent  to  which  material  is  already  in  the  public 

domain or will become so. ...

8.9 

The  legitimate  questions  which  arise  are:  (a)  Was  the  photograph  taken  in  circumstances 
of privacy? (b) Does the Prince lose his right to privacy because he has invited to his hotel 
suite people whom he does not know? (c) Is there any basis for contending that the Prince 
consented to the taking of the photograph (there being no suggestion that he did) and, if he 
did not, is there a difference between taking the photograph (which the Code describes as 
unacceptable) and publishing it? (c) Accepting that there is a public interest in freedom of 
expression itself, was there any public interest in the publication of the photographs (rather 
than the story with the description of the photographs)?

8.10  A more general question can also be posed about the Code. It is entirely understandable 
that a public interest can, in certain circumstances, defeat the rights to privacy enshrined in 
the Code (and, of course, Article 8 of the ECHR) and that freedom of expression is itself in 
the public interest (although that cannot defeat the privacy right in every case because that 
would make the provision meaningless). It is more difficult to see why ‘the extent to which 
material is already in the public domain’ should itself create a public interest which permits 
publication. It might be that it ought to be cast as a separate question but, on the basis that 
the code is a statement of ethical good practice, it is open to question whether the ethical 
balance should be affected simply because others who do not hold themselves bound by 
such a code ignore its principles.

F

The Sun’s letter

8.11  Mr Dinsmore raised seven points, not all of which address the questions set out above, but 
which it is worthwhile considering in turn. The first concerned the legitimate public debate. 
He said:

“The  entire  UK  media  including  both  print,  online  and  television  has  reported  on 
the fact and existence of these photographs. This has in turn generated a legitimate 
public debate as to the Prince’s behaviour. There is now a debate across the country 
as to whether such conduct is acceptable from the third in line to the throne who is 
increasingly taking on a more public and official role ... That debate should not take 
place in a vacuum.”

8.12  The argument regarding the legitimacy of public debate is powerful but, in the context of 
this particular publication, of limited, if any, relevance. There is no doubt that the remit of 
his protection officers is an important issue with a legitimate public interest. Further, for the 
purposes of this argument, it is appropriate to assume that whether the Prince’s conduct 
is “acceptable” is also a matter of public interest (although a point made later in the letter 
about his position in the army appears somewhat specious). Such a debate, however, did not 
take place in a vacuum: what transpired and what the photographs revealed was graphically 
described in print. The debate did not need the pictures.

8.13  The  next  three  points  can  be  taken  together.  The  second  and  third  concern  the  fact  that 
the media had identified the website on which the photographs could be viewed, making 

582

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicthe point that 77% of the public have access to the internet so that the photographs are in 
the public domain (which the PCC Code requires to be taken into account). The number of 
hits to the pictures, it is asserted, rose from 25.8 million to 160 million by 11:00hrs on the 
morning of 23 August (although how much of that is the consequence of the press coverage is 
another matter); the photographs were also on Facebook. It was argued that the suggestion 
(by the Palace) that the fact that the photographs have appeared in another jurisdiction is 
‘meaningless’ was to miss the point that the internet transcends jurisdictions.

8.14  The  fourth  point  is  the  reverse  of  the  third.  The  fact  that  the  photographs  are  so  widely 
available on the internet creates an issue for those who do not have access to the internet so 
that there is “an unfair and inappropriate situation adversely affecting the ongoing debate in 
this country”. Mr Dinsmore goes on:

“That situation cannot be allowed to continue in a debate of such importance where 
everybody  should  have  equal  access  to  the  photographs  in  question  and  not  just 
those who can access the internet.”

8.15  These points utterly ignore a number of equally valid arguments. First, it is important to repeat 
that it is entirely possible to have the debate (however important it is) without seeing the 
photographs at all. Second, anybody who feels that it is necessary to see them (for whatever 
reason) is able to do so, for the vast majority of those without internet doubtless will know 
someone who has access, or could go to a library or to one of any number of places where 
access to the internet is possible. Third, and of particular importance, it ignores the fact that 
there may also be a large number of people who do not want to see the photographs or, 
even more likely, who do not want their children to see the photographs. To some extent, 
parents can control what their children can access on the internet: if they take their child into 
a newsagent, garage or supermarket – or past a news stall – the control that they must be 
entitled to exercise is lost.

8.16  The fourth argument resonates across a range of issues. The fact that something is on the 
internet does not justify its publication in a newspaper. The internet is an uncontrolled space 
with  material  upon  it  which  I  anticipate  The  Sun  would  not  wish  to  publish  because  it  is 
pornographic, racist or offends one of the many other codes of decency to which most people 
aspire. Bob Satchwell of the Society of Editors put the point in this way:114

“Of  course,  freedom  of  the  press  is  important.  But  just  because  you  can  publish 
something doesn’t mean that you should.”

8.17  The fifth argument advanced by Mr Dinsmore is to challenge the assertion that the reason 
for publication of the photographs would be prurience and nothing more and then to repeat 
the first argument about the issues that arise while ignoring the ability to have the debate 
without sight of the photographs. The letter then goes on to assert:

“For  that  debate  to  take  place  in  an  informed  light  these  photographs  should  be 
published in accordance not only with our Article 10 right to impart information but 
also in accordance with the general public’s right to receive it.”

8.18  The  Article  8/Article  10  debate  again  requires  an  analysis  of  the  public  interest  although 
“special considerations attach to photographs in the field of privacy. ... As a means of invading 

114 as reported in The Times, 24 August 2012

583

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFprivacy, a photograph is particularly intrusive”.115 In reality, it takes the argument no further 
forward.

8.19  Mr  Dinsmore  then  cites  a  decision  of  the  PCC  from  2010  concerned  with  the  magazine 
Loaded where a photograph had been given a wide circulation on the internet such that it 
was untenable to rule that it was wrong for it to be used in a magazine. This decision (part of 
the jurisprudence of the PCC) is itself open to criticism and is further discussed in the light of 
the response of the PCC and the further Royal story.

8.20  Finally, Mr Dinsmore suggests that although the Prince is naked, the photographs do not show 
him “in any situation of extreme personal embarrassment nor do they reveal any intimate 
details of his body”. I am not sure of the basis on which Mr Dinsmore makes the assessment 
(if this is what he is saying) that these photographs are less invasive of the Prince’s privacy 
than they might have been and therefore justifiable or that they would not cause extreme 
personal embarrassment: it may not be without interest that the 21-year old who posed for 
the mock-up is reported to later to have tweeted “lol 5 mins of fame #cringin”.

The Sun article

F

8.21  The full front page headline “HEIR IT IS Pic of naked Harry you’ve already seen on the internet” 
(inconsistent  with  the  argument  that  the  purpose  of  publishing  the  pictures was  to  show 
them to those who did not have access to the internet), goes on “HEIR IT IS; WE FIGHT FOR 
PRESS  FREEDOM”,  “PRINT  HARRY”  and  “Naked  Vegas  pics  swept  the  world  on  web.  Now 
it’s  vital  you  see  them  here  The  Sun  SAYS”.  The  article  goes  on  to  assert  that  its  readers 
“have been prevented from seeing” the pictures in print and later that “the Press were still 
effectively banned from using the pictures” so that “millions of people who get their news in 
print or have no web access could not take a full part in that national conversation because 
they could not see the images”. It also argues that the Prince had “compromised his own 
privacy”. The paper ends:

“It  is  absurd  in  the  internet  age  newspapers  like  The  Sun  could  be  stopped  from 
publishing stories and pictures already seen by millions on the free-for-all that is the 
web.”

8.22  Quite apart from the merits of the decision, this article raises other issues of concern. The 
request from the solicitors acting on behalf of St James’s Palace is set out at length above. It 
does no more than respond to a request for their reaction to the stated intention to publish 
and state their position. It does not “effectively ban” their use. It does not prevent anyone 
from seeing them. Neither is the issue one of press freedom: the press (including The Sun) 
were free to do what they wanted and to publish what they wished. The Palace only referred 
to the Editors’ Code of Practice to which The Sun voluntarily subscribes. The only mechanism 
that  could  have  prevented  The  Sun  from  publishing  the  photographs  was  an  injunction 
obtained from the High Court and there is not the slightest suggestion that such relief was 
even sought. Yet that is not how the story was told.

8.23  Finally, reliance was placed on the fact that the pictures were on “the free-for-all that is the 
web”. Quite apart from the other material available on the web that The Sun would not print, 
the point of the Editors’ Code is that newspapers subscribe (or are supposed to subscribe) 
to higher standards than “free-for-all” which does not put a bar in place at all. Further, if 
that is  the answer, it  is  a real  risk that a  determined effort could  be made to  put  a  story

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicor a photograph that offends the Code onto the internet through an intermediary in order 
to demonstrate that it is then in the public domain and, thus, can be printed. It is open to 
question whether such a “free-for-all” is in the public interest.

Other Comment

8.24  The Sunday Times (owned, of course, also by NI) published an editorial on Sunday 26 August 
under the headline “THE SUN’S BRAVE LONE STAND FOR PRESS FREEDOM”, saying that Prince 
Harry had put the issue of press freedom squarely on the agenda and asserting that other 
newspapers  did  not  publish  “because  of  the  atmosphere  created”  by  the  Inquiry.  It  cited 
many occasions when British newspapers had been deprived of information freely available 
to counterparts overseas including the abdication crisis and the Spycatcher affair, although 
it recognised that people in Britain were not being deprived of anything but were “just not 
allowed to see it in their newspapers”. The leader goes on:

“Critics  said  The  Sun’s  public  interest  arguments  were  a  convenient  mask  for 
commercial motives. It is a spurious criticism. Newspapers are fighting for their lives 
in  the  toughest  of  economic  climates  combined  with  technological  changes  that 
weigh heavily against traditional print. If they are not commercial they will die and 
they cannot let the internet become the prime forum for communication. But that 
was not the sole purpose of publishing. There is a dangerous coalition forming of 
aggrieved film and television stars, out-of-sorts Labour politicians and bien pensants 
who would happily bring much greater regulation and censorship to the press. They 
believe they should decide what is in the public interest and not the millions who buy 
the red top papers. To publish these pictures was a defiant gesture to those would-be 
moral arbiters.
Of course many images and much content on the internet will rightly never find their 
way into our newspapers for the good reasons of taste, accuracy and relevance. But 
this was different. It was of enormous interest to the public and it was in the public 
interest to know how the third in line to the throne really behaves. The public can then 
decide how it regards him. The bigger issue is the future of the press. If it is gagged 
and stifled it will die and the country would be hugely poorer for it. John Wilkes fought 
long and hard for freedom of expression, including publishing what was regarded as 
pornography at the time. Lord Justice Leveson, it is hoped, understands that. It was 
right to publish — and not be damned.”

8.25  This is a remarkable article. On the subject of the story, there is no discussion of the Editors’ 
Code of Conduct, of any right that Prince Harry might have to privacy or any public interest 
in publication of the photographs. Given the approach of the Palace to the PCC, there was 
no question of the press being gagged, of an attack on press freedom or an attempt to hide 
the story (as in the abdication). The commercial issues facing the press are understood but 
nobody has ever suggested that the only way the problem can be solved is by abandoning the 
Code of Conduct. As for the millions who buy red-top papers, The Sunday Times published 
the result of a poll to the effect that 61% of respondents thought that The Sun was wrong to 
publish the photographs and 68% thought that the Prince’s behaviour was acceptable.

8.26  As for censorship, not a single witness either orally or in writing sought censorship. Everyone 
recognised the importance of a free press and the benefits of public interest investigative 
journalism. No one suggested they should be the arbiters of press practice: all wanted the 
press to follow the letter and spirit of a code for which the editors had responsibility. That is 

585

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFnot to say that they believed in the present operation of the PCC or considered that the Code 
could not be improved but that is not the criticism that the editorial makes.

8.27 

It would be possible to examine the coverage of other titles and the selective reporting of 
opinion from politicians and others. It is a matter of comment that, with the exception of 
the Independent on Sunday, almost all the national Sunday titles took the same view as The 
Sunday Times. The press are, of course, entitled to a partisan view but it is difficult to see 
how it represents its readers if the majority opinion is not even expressed or explained. The 
inference may be that the agenda it was following was its own.

The PCC

8.28  The way in which the PCC generally responds to complaints has already been analysed at 
length.116 On the other hand, this very recent example of the approach taken by the PCC, 
following the conclusion of all the evidence heard by the Inquiry, is extremely illuminative. 
Furthermore, there are sufficient specific features of its reaction which it is worth considering 
in detail and which justify (or at least excuse) what might be a measure of repetition.

8.29  Following contact from St James’s Palace, the story continues with the head of complaints 
and pre-publication services. She passed the letter from the solicitors on to the editors and 
invited any discussion about code issues. It is not suggested that she was approached by The 
Sun for advice pre-publication or at all (although the letter setting out their defence was sent 
before the photographs were, in fact, published). It has since been reported that the PCC did, 
in fact, provide advice to other editors, on request, about the relevant issues.

8.30  Meanwhile, after The Sun’s publication of the photographs, the PCC received around 3,800 
complaints that the photographs breached clause 3 of the Code: by the time of their regular 
meeting, no formal complaint had been made by or on behalf of Prince Harry. In a statement, 
the PCC goes on to observe:

F

“The Commission would be best placed to understand these issues – including the 
circumstances in which the photographs were taken – with the formal involvement 
of Prince Harry’s representatives. In addition, an investigation by the Commission, 
without consent, would have the potential itself to pose an intrusion.
The Commission is grateful to the many members of the public who have contacted 
it to express concerns about The Sun’s coverage but has concluded that it would be 
inappropriate for it to open an investigation at this time for the reasons above.”

8.31  At the conclusion of its statement, the PCC comment that it would be wrong to preempt 
the conclusions that it might reach were a complaint to be pursued but it “notes” that the 
question of how to apply the privacy provisions in relation to material freely available on 
the internet has been faced on a number of occasions in decided cases, observing that each 
decision is reached only after a detailed examination of the facts of the case. It then makes the 
final comment (to which reference is made later) that it will publish guidance for publications 
on these matters.

8.32  The upshot is that although the majority of those polled (as reported in The Sunday Times) 
felt it wrong to publish the photographs and a substantial number of members of the public 
felt sufficiently strongly about the matter that they complained to the PCC, the PCC will say 
nothing about the matter, one way or the other, unless Prince Harry personally complains. 

116 Part D Chapter 2

586

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public8.33 

This is notwithstanding the fact that his views are well known: they are reflected in the letter 
that solicitors wrote on behalf of St James’s Palace prior to publication. The PCC is hardly 
enhancing its reputation as a definitive arbiter of press standards by taking this course.

It may be the case that the PCC might have been or be better able to understand the issue 
from the perspective of the Prince if he provided further details of the circumstances in which 
the photographer came to be in his suite and was not prevented from taking the photographs; 
however, to ask him to do that would, undeniably, constitute ‘further intrusion’ by providing 
information not presently available and which would all then be deployed in public. The PCC 
argues that investigating without the consent of the Prince would have the potential itself 
to pose an intrusion but The Sun had to make its decision based on the material then in the 
public domain. If he were to have complained, it is not difficult to see the paper seeking to 
put questions to St James’s Palace about these matters in order to provide some additional 
arguments not available at the time. In the context of this case, that would undeniably be 
‘further intrusion’.

8.34  There could be circumstances, perhaps concerned with whether or not the subject of the 
story has ‘set it up’, that to investigate without a complaint might constitute an intrusion, 
but there is no suggestion of that sort of circumstance in this case. Here, the question is not 
whether there is a public interest in the facts of the story and St James’s Palace has not sought 
to contend to the contrary. The only question relates to the publication of the photographs. 
In that regard, there is sufficient information available in the public domain and the stance of 
St James’s Palace is quite clear from the letter which was circulated. If the PCC is concerned 
about standards and the Editors’ Code of Conduct, there is nothing to stop it analysing the 
issue based on the material that was available to The Sun at the time: in doing so, everybody 
would know where the PCC stood on the matter. As it is, the fact that at least 3,800 members 
of the public felt that it was appropriate for the PCC to look at this complaint is deemed 
irrelevant but, in reality, by saying (and doing) nothing, the PCC will be seen as endorsing the 
approach of The Sun whether or not it does so. The Sun having ‘got away’ without adverse 
adjudication (which is what the editors say they most fear) will be taken as a green light and 
a precedent for the future.

8.35 

Issuing  guidance  (which  is  what  the  PCC  identifies  that  it  intends  to  do  “drawing  on  its 
decisions in previous cases”)117 is precisely the effect of considering the facts in this particular 
case. Indeed, Mr Dinsmore throws the gauntlet down to the PCC in the sixth argument in 
his letter of 23 August when, in relation to its decision in the case involving the magazine 
Loaded, it ruled against the complaint “on a situation very similar to this” (where material 
had already been given a wide circulation) and asked the PCC to distinguish that complaint 
from this. Because of the further story involving the Duchess of Cambridge, this general point 
is analysed below.

8.36  The purpose of recounting this story is not to reach a view, one way or the other, about the 
publication of these photographs. In the context of this Inquiry, what this episode illuminates 
is the adequacy (or otherwise) of the mechanism for maintaining the standards to which the 
press loudly asserts it adheres. It has since been announced that, in the light of his deployment 
to Afghanistan, Prince Harry will not pursue a complaint but there was, in truth, no point in St 
James’s Palace making a complaint to the PCC. If such a complaint was rejected, it will signal 
the very free for all based on what is available on the web; if one had been made and upheld, 
it is abundantly clear from the various press reports that followed the publication that the 
adjudication will be rejected and blamed on what is said to be the effect of the Inquiry. In 
truth, the moment has been lost and the right to publish effectively endorsed without the 

117 On 15 November 2012 the PCC published guidance, http://pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=ODEwNw==

587

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFcontrary argument having been analysed. To say that guidance will be issued in the future 
does not carry the issue any further.

HRH The Duchess of Cambridge

8.37  The story of Prince Harry was quickly overtaken by a different story which evinced a very 
different reaction. On 14 September 2012, a French magazine, Closer, published photographs 
of HRH The Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless taken by a paparazzo with an ultra long 
lens while she was on holiday in a private chateaux belonging to Viscount Linley in Provence. 
It is said (and, having regard to the length of the lens required, doubtless entirely accurately) 
that  the  photographs  can  only  have  been  taken  from  a  considerable  distance  away.  The 
publication was followed by republication in the Irish Daily Star (much to the annoyance of 
Mr Desmond whose Northern and Shell company is a part owner of the paper) and in other 
newspapers and magazines. The photographs are on the internet.

8.38  The press in the UK universally condemned the publication of these photographs as a gross 
breach of the privacy to which the Duchess was entitled. The Sunday Times118 published an 
editorial identifying a contrast between the photographs of Prince Harry (“when he invited 
people into his hotel suite for his naked antics” and in respect of which he “rightly did not 
complain”) and these photographs (“of a young couple on a very private holiday” so that 
“William and Catherine have rightly resorted to the law”) although noting that they “were 
freely available on the internet within hours”. The editorial also said:

F

“Editors of British newspapers did not need the threat of privacy laws or even Lord 
Justice  Leveson’s  inquiry  to  know  not  to  publish  these  pictures.  When  they  were 
hawked around Fleet Street they were met with a cool response. It was a case of self-
regulation working; the Editors’ Code specifically prohibits photographing individuals 
in private places without their consent. Newspapers in Britain in any case knew they 
would face a readers’ revolt if they dared to publish.”

8.39  The  language  of  this  editorial  is  revealing.  The  first  article  talks  about  press  freedom  and 
defiant gestures with the public having the right to know how the third in line to the throne 
behaves. The latter recognises that photographing individuals in private places without their 
consent is specifically prohibited and that newspapers would face a revolt if they dared to 
publish although I am sure that the editorial was not making the point that the decision not 
to publish was because the ethical and commercial considerations ran in tandem. In the case 
of Prince Harry, there was a story which, in the public interest could be told; in the case of 
the Duchess, there was not. In both cases, what is at issue is the publication of photographs 
by editors bound by a Code of Conduct and the relevance of the fact of their publication on 
the internet.

The relevance of the internet

8.40 

It is necessary to return to the reaction from the PCC and the reference in its statement to the 
internet. Following its decision not to launch any investigation into the publication by The Sun 
of the photographs of Prince Harry without his consent, the statement went on:

“It would be wrong to pre-empt the conclusions the Commission might reach were 
a complaint to be pursued. Nonetheless, the Commission notes that the question of 
how  to  apply  the  terms  of  Clause  3  (Privacy)  in  relation  to  material  that  is  freely 

118 16 September 2012

588

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicavailable on the internet is one that it has faced on a number of occasions in recent 
years, including in the cases of Mullan, Weir & Campbell v Scottish Sunday Express 
(2009);  A  Woman  v  Loaded  (2010);  Minogue  v  Daily  Mirror/Daily  Record  (2010); 
and Baskerville v Daily Mail/The Independent on Sunday (2011). In each instance it 
reached a decision only after a detailed examination of the facts of the case.”

8.41  The PCC is not, of course, bound by the system of precedent that operates within the common 
law. However, it is obviously important that there should be consistency of decisions provided, 
that the decisions are truly on point, relevant and not clearly distinguishable. Not surprisingly, 
none of the cited cases are entirely relevant because none concern members of the Royal 
Family whose activities, however much in keeping with what might reasonably be expected 
of young people when relaxing in private, will attract attention if likely to titillate the prurient.

8.42  Three of the four cases concerned material put onto social networking sites (and, thus, it 
was argued into the public domain) by the persons affected. In all three (two of which were 
rejected), the PCC referred to the extent to which it was acceptable to publish information 
taken from such websites even if intended only for a small group of acquaintances. In the 
one complaint upheld (Mullen and others), three survivors of the Dunblane shooting some 
13 years earlier had put material about themselves and their activities onto a website; this 
information was then published alongside photographs although efforts had been made over 
the preceding years to shield them from publicity. The PCC held they had done nothing to 
warrant  media  scrutiny,  images  (even  if  publicly  available)  were  taken  out  of  context  and 
presented in a way designed to humiliate.

8.43  The other two cases involving social networking sites can be summarised in this way. The 
first (A Woman v Loaded) concerned photographs of her breasts which she had placed on 
her Bebo site when she was 15 but which had since been uploaded onto the internet along 
with her name, having been easily accessed by Google search. The magazine had published 
a piece discussing the fact that the material was already widely used in this way by others. 
The PCC considered that the fact that she was then 15 at the time of the photographs raised 
issues of taste but as she was an adult at the time of this publication, the additional protection 
available for children no longer applied. Given that the additional public interest required in 
relation to material covering children is, in part, to protect them against themselves when 
they are not old enough to appreciate the consequences, it is difficult to see why the fact that 
she was no longer a child should have prevented the higher standard being applied: that is 
not to the point in this case. What was decided was that because the information in the same 
form was widely available, republication did not breach the Code.

8.44  The second case (Baskerville) concerned material written by a civil servant relating to her 
employment which she had posted on Twitter anticipating a small circulation to her followers 
but failing to take account of the ability to retweet and so reaching a far wider audience. 
Having decided that there was a public interest (the wisdom of civil servants using social media 
platforms which could give rise to claims of conflict with professional duties), notwithstanding 
the distress caused, no breach of clause 3 of the Code was established.

8.45  The third case is nearer in one sense (because it concerns a famous personality) but further 
away in another. Dannii Minogue complained that her pregnancy was reported prior to the 
12 week scan. The Daily Mirror and the Daily Record sought to justify the breach of the rule 
forbidding such publication on the basis that the information was available the previous day 
on a blog and on the Sydney Morning Herald website. It was argued that the news was either 
‘in’ or ‘not in’ the public domain and given these reports had ceased to be private. The PCC 
ruled the references in the blog and the website were speculative and that the purpose of 

589

Chapter 5 | Some Case StudiesFhaving regard to “the extent” to which information had previously appeared was common 
sense for, if it were otherwise, reference on-line would represent automatic justification for 
publication. This complaint was upheld.

8.46  Based upon A Woman v Loaded, it might be thought that substantial dissemination of the 
material is sufficient to trump any other claim to privacy: that is precisely what Mr Dinsmore 
argued. He would doubtless point to the fact that Prince Harry was not a child; he effectively 
argued that the fact that there is no basis for suggesting that he had encouraged or consented 
to the taking or publication of the photographs was more than met, first, by the public interest 
in his behaviour and, second, by their widespread publication on the internet and elsewhere.

8.47  The reality is that these cases are not truly comparable. As is patently clear, anything that any 
member of the Royal Family does will always attract attention and if widespread publication 
trumps any right to privacy, then there is no protection at all. Paparazzi will seek to obtain 
what photographs they can; someone, somewhere will be only too pleased to publish them 
and, if the Code was construed in that way, the door would be perpetually open to any title 
then to publish without being in breach.

8.48  However, that is not the case that the press mount. Nobody at all has suggested that publishing 
the photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge would be anything other than a breach of the 
Code, notwithstanding the widespread availability of the images in other jurisdictions. So, at 
least for the Royal Family, widespread availability of an image on the internet on its own is 
not sufficient. There has to be some other public interest in publication of that image in order 
to justify it. For the Duchess, there clearly is not. But that equally means that playing the card 
of widespread availability is not good enough in relation to the Prince Harry photographs 
either, particularly when the public interest points that arise from the Las Vegas holiday do 
not depend on sight of the photographs.

F

8.49  Nor can a distinction be drawn between the paparazzo who took the long lens photographs 
and whoever sold the mobile phone photographs in Las Vegas: both did what they did for 
money. True, the paparazzo was not known about and had not been trusted not to betray the 
confidence which followed the invitation to visit Prince Harry in his suite, but it is difficult to 
argue that this is not a distinction without a difference.

8.50 

It is worth repeating the argument published in The Sun newspaper:

“It  is  absurd  in  the  internet  age  newspapers  like  The  Sun  could  be  stopped  from 
publishing stories and pictures already seen by millions on the free-for-all that is the 
web.”

8.51  Given that this would apply equally to the photographs of the Duchess, this alone is not good 
enough. Neither is the argument that it is up to the editor to exercise his judgment.119 In one 
sense, that is always true; but such decisions must be taken within the boundaries of a clear 
and effective code: that is what it is for.

8.52 

Irrespective of the rhetoric in the press, this is not about censorship or banning anything; 
it is not about freedom of the press; it is not about statutory regulation. It is not about the 
editors  being  forbidden  to  publish  the  photographs;  St  James’s  Palace  must  be  entitled 
to  express  its  own  view  without  being  accused  of  having  taken  any  of  these  draconian 

119 although it is to be noted that Northern and Shell which is a part owner of the Irish Daily Star issued a statement 
expressing its disappointment that the decision to publish had been taken without reference to the company or to Richard 
Desmond. That raises a question about the role of proprietors in editorial decisions but where issues of reputation arise, 
different considerations may apply

590

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicmeasures. Whatever system of press regulation is in force, ultimately, in this country, any 
editor will be free to publish what he or she believes should be published. What it is about, 
however, is maintenance of standards and the requirement that an editor is held to account 
by someone for the decisions which have been made, based on a Code that has attracted 
the confidence and general approval of editors and commands the confidence of the public. 
Even a complaints handling mechanism resolves complaints made by the public when it is not 
necessary to obtain further details and there is no additional intrusion beyond that which is 
already in the public domain.

8.53  Neither is this a case simply about freedom of expression. The Royal Family are, of course, in 
the public eye and its members will be held to account for what they do. But if society wants 
them also to mix with the public and in the real world, they have to be given the space to do 
so and their right to have a degree of privacy (less than that available to ordinary members 
of  the  public  but  more  than  at  a  level  that  is  vanishingly  small)  must  also  be  recognised. 
Precisely where the line is to be drawn is not a decision for the Inquiry to make. But decisions 
such as this have to be made by a body that is prepared to see the entire picture from every 
perspective. The decision requires balance and, perhaps, rather more balance than has been 
afforded to the issue in the discussion that the press has initiated and conducted.

8.54  This does not mean that photographs will not be available in other jurisdictions across the 
world, or that information will not be available about what has happened: there is no news 
blackout and the parallel with the Abdication crisis simply does not withstand examination. 
To  that  extent,  therefore,  the  Royal  Family  and  anyone  in  the  public  eye  will  have  to  be 
aware of  what can  happen  and  take steps  accordingly.  But  if  the press in  this  country do 
aspire to behave ethically and in accordance with standards that they have agreed, it does 
mean obeying those standards consistently and not only when it suits them or when it is 
commercially convenient to do so. Otherwise it is a free for all.

Other events

8.55  These are not the only stories that have been published in the period since the Inquiry has 
concluded that could be the subject of comment. Watching the press, as it was clear the 
Inquiry intended to do, there have been other articles and photographs that have attracted 
attention  and  raised  concerns  about  breach  of  privacy  without  any  apparent  justification 
based  in  the  public  interest.  To  start  to  analyse  further  stories  and  further  examples  is 
unnecessary although it is worth observing that what has been happening seems, at least in 
my judgment sufficient to undermine the criticism that the Inquiry has chilled press activity.

CritiCisms oF the Culture, praCtiCes 
and ethiCs oF the press

Introduction
The case studies set out in the previous Chapter provide examples of unacceptable press 
practices. The purpose of this Chapter is to set out the broader evidence seen and heard 
by the Inquiry which illustrates that those case studies do not represent aberrations of the 
press, but fit within a broader context of a culture (albeit a minority culture) of unethical and 
unlawful press practices.

Not  least  given  the  continuing  availability  of  all  of  the  evidence  online,  it  would  not  be 
worthwhile for this Chapter of the Report to approach each witness in sequential fashion, 
summarising his or her testimony before moving to the next. Such an approach would fail 
to do justice to the evidence in the context of an Inquiry examining the culture, practices 
and ethics of the press. Instead, the evidence will be examined thematically, in the search 
for possible trends and generic issues. Having now heard and carefully considered all the 
evidence, it is much easier to discern these trends than it was when the evidential picture 
was unfolding at pace from the start of Module One.

In reaching the conclusions which are set out below, all the evidence that the Inquiry has 
received (whether presented orally or only in writing) has been considered and taken into 
account. Furthermore, care has been taken to differentiate between those lapses in standards 
which  should  be  envisaged  as  isolated  failings  which  do  not  exemplify  any  wider  cultural 
issue, and those which should properly be understood as indicative of a pattern or theme. As 
previously explained, distinguishing between these two categories depends principally on a 
qualitative assessment of the evidence (viewed both in its own right and in the context of all 
the evidence the Inquiry has received), but also, albeit to a lesser extent, on a quantitative 
one.

The Chapter begins, in Sections 1 – 7, by looking at the evidence heard by the Inquiry of a 
cultural indifference within parts of the press to individual privacy and dignity. That broad 
theme encompasses evidence that parts of the press have used unethical and/or unlawful 
means  to  access  private  information,  including  phone  hacking,  blagging,  email  hacking, 
theft, and covert surveillance. It also encompasses evidence that newspapers have published 
obviously  confidential  information  without  any  public  interest  in  doing  so,  have  harassed 
subjects  of  stories  and  their  families,  have  been  insensitive  in  investigating  and  reporting 
death or tragedy, and have failed to have regard to the high level of protection appropriate 
to children.

Section 8 then examines a broader critique: a complaint that the press, or parts of it, fail to 
represent women and minorities fairly. This critique is not related so much to representations 
of individuals as the representation of whole classes of people.

Section 9 then considers the extent to which deliberate or reckless inaccuracy is a cultural or 
systemic problem within parts of the press. Associated with that theme, Section 10 examines 
the issue of payments for stories, and assesses the extent to which the widespread practice 
of offering financial incentives for stories might incentivise inaccuracies and/or encourage 
breaches of privacy.

592

1.7 

1.8 

Sections 11 and 12 examine the way in which the press responds to critics and complainants. 
Together they consider the evidence that the press, or parts of it, are hostile to complainants, 
use  attack  as  the  best  form  of  defence,  and  seek  to  avoid  giving  justified  apologies  or 
corrections due prominence, if they are given at all.

The evidence deployed in this Chapter may be relevant to more than one of the headings or 
categories set out below, because they overlap. Accordingly, even if one part of the evidence 
may have been expressly referred to only once, it may well have informed more than one 
conclusion.

2.  lack of respect for privacy and dignity
2.1 

One of the main complaints advanced by those who testified during the first two weeks of 
evidence, and subsequently, was that a cultural strand exists within the press betraying an 
unethical cultural indifference to the consequences of exposing private lives, and a failure to 
treat individuals with appropriate dignity and respect. This was, in essence, an overarching 
complaint  which  encompasses  many  of  the  criticisms  addressed  below.  Phone  hacking, 
blagging,  the  widespread  use  of  covert  surveillance,  harassment,  and  the  publication  of 
private and confidential information all reflect, to varying extents, this cultural indifference.

2.2 

2.3 

The experiences of the McCanns, the Dowlers, Christopher Jefferies and Max Mosley, already 
discussed in some detail above, also exemplify this indifference. However, these high profile 
examples were by no means exceptional, nor were all or predominantly concerned with the 
practices  at  the  News  of  the  World  (NoTW).  The  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from  numerous 
public figures and private individuals alike, who were victims of a tendency within sections 
of the press to treat people without respect or dignity and to publish private information 
without regard to the consequences of, or public interest in, doing so.

The singer Charlotte Church gave evidence relating to the exposure of the private lives of her 
and members of her family over the course of more than a decade. From the age of 12 she 
was the subject of intense press scrutiny. She spoke of her experiences of being door-stepped 
and stalked by press and paparazzi,1 of finding evidence of a secret camera installed in her 
garden hedge,2 and of her regular pursuit by press and paparazzi whilst at home and abroad 
on holiday.3

2.4  While a child, titles regularly published details about Ms Church that can be described as 
mere tittle-tattle: reports of her weight gain, drinking, or smoking.4 But more intimate details 
of her private life were published as well: when she was 17 years old, a newspaper published 
details  of  her  sexual  experiences  with  an  ex-boyfriend,  and  paid  the  ex-boyfriend  for  the 
story.5

After attaining majority, Ms Church continued to suffer from press intrusion. Three examples 
from the evidence she gave of intrusive and distressing coverage were particularly notable. 
First, Ms Church’s pregnancy was revealed by The Sun, despite the title’s knowledge that she 
was still in her first trimester of pregnancy, and notwithstanding a request from Ms Church’s 
PR agent that the title not publish any details until the end of the first trimester. Ms Church 
spoke  of  the  upset  that  publication  had  caused  to  her  and  her  family:  her  parents  were 
unaware that she was pregnant until the article was brought to their attention.6

Second, as part of its coverage of an alleged plot to kidnap Ms Church, the NoTW published 
details sufficient to identify Ms Church’s address, despite express requests to refrain from 
doing so.7 The publication of those details caused Ms Church untold anxiety, and potentially 
placed her at an increased risk from the very plot on which the title was reporting.

The third example was, perhaps, the most egregious, given that the published story related 
not to Ms Church herself, but to her parents, who were, to all intents and purposes, private 
people with no public life or persona. On 11 November 2005, the NoTW published a story 
entitled “Church’s three in a bed cocaine shock” next to a picture of Ms Church. Despite the 
fact that the juxtaposition of headline and photo gave the (probably deliberate) impression 
that the allegations in the story related to Ms Church herself, they in fact related to her father. 
The content of the story was deeply intrusive and contained intimate details of the private 
lives of both Ms Church’s mother and father. The story began: “Superstar Charlotte Church’s 
mum tried to kill herself because her husband is a love rat hooked on cocaine and three-in-a-
bed orgies.”8 Whether the substance of the article was true or false, there was no conceivable 
public interest in the publication of this story which had a profound effect on Ms Church and 
her family.9 As Ms Church noted:10

“It was basically just totally sensationalised, and whether partially or wholly true, I 
just really hated the fact that my parents, who had never been in this industry apart 
from in looking after me, were being exposed and vilified in this fashion. It just had a 
massive, massive impact on my family life, on my mother’s health, which the News of 
the World had reported on before then, on her mental health state and her hospital 
treatment… So they knew how vulnerable she was and still printed this story, which 
was horrific. And I just – I can’t think of any justification for printing a story like that.”

2.8 

The  justification,  according  to  Paul  McMullan,  was  circulation.  The  story  interested  the 
readership and that, for him, was justification enough for publication.11

2.9  Ms Church has, to some extent, courted press attention. As part of her promotional obligations, 
she appears in the press, on radio and on television and has spoken about her relationships 
and private life in this context. In addition, she has chosen to appear in magazines such as OK! 
and Hello with her children. However, on any construction of the Editors’ Code of Conduct, 
those facts alone cannot justify the persistent and intrusive level of press interest to which 
she  has  been  subjected,  nor  can  it  justify  the  publication  of  private  information  without 
regard to the public interest or the consequences of publication.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.10 

In any case, as Ms Church’s evidence showed, an appearance in a magazine such as OK! or 
Hello does not necessarily indicate a desire to expose her entire private live or the lives of 
her family to public view. In her case, her evidence was that her decision to appear in these 
magazines with her new-born baby was specifically taken to control the release of pictures of 
her child in a context where up to six paparazzi were camped outside her home during and 
after the home-birth of her daughter.12 Moreover, even if it were the case that Ms Church 
had, by her previous conduct, relinquished any reasonable expectation of privacy, she had 
not done so on behalf of her parents.

2.11  Ms Church’s evidence bore similarities to that given by the writer JK Rowling. She too has 
been subjected to intense press interest for more than a decade, ever since the publication of 
the first Harry Potter book. She also complained of door-stepping, pursuit by paparazzi, and 
the unjustified publication of details of her private life and that of her family.13 Ms Rowling 
explained that shortly after the publication of the first Harry Potter book, she was “literally 
driven out of the first house [she] had ever owned (which faced almost directly onto the street) 
because of journalists banging on the door, questioning the neighbours and sitting in parked 
cars immediately outside the gate”.14

2.12  Ms Rowling’s primary complaints related to the privacy of her family and the privacy of her 
home: an assessment of her evidence shows that parts of the press have shown indifference 
to, or disrespect for, both.

2.13 

In respect of her children, Ms Rowling has been consistent and clear since she first came 
to public attention that she did not want her children exposed to public view. There can be 
no doubt that the press has been fully aware of her stance. She has refused requests to be 
photographed with her children for publicity purposes, she has avoided taking her children to 
any events where photographers are likely to be present, and she has refused to discuss her 
children in interviews. Where photographs of her children have been published, she and her 
husband have taken legal and other action to prevent republication.15

2.14  Nonetheless, Ms Rowling’s evidence suggested that parts of the press have shown a casual 
disregard  of  her  desire  to  protect  her  children’s  privacy.  Ms  Rowling  provided  numerous 
examples to illustrate the point. In 1998, after she had refused requests to allow photographs 
of her daughter, press photographers began to gather outside her home in an attempt to 
take  such  photos.16  Periodically,  over  the  following  decade,  photographers  continued  to 
congregate outside her home and to pursue her, and her family, in the UK and abroad.

2.15 

In 2001, OK! magazine published a photograph of her eight year old daughter in a bikini, while 
on a secluded beach in Mauritius. The photograph, taken with a long lens camera, led to a PCC 
adjudication, in her favour, that Ms Rowling hoped would lead to a change in the behaviour 
of press photographers.17 Instead, she recalled no change at all. In 2003, after the birth of 
her son, Ms Rowling’s house was “besieged” by press photographers. As a consequence she

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFlargely confined herself to her house and, on the occasions where she left the house, would 
cover her daughter in a blanket to preserve her privacy.18 Despite her efforts at this time, 
intrusive photographs of her son and daughter were both taken and published.19

2.16 

In 2005, after a photograph of her 18 month old son was taken with a long lens and published 
in the Sunday Express, Ms Rowling issued proceedings against Express Newspapers Limited 
and  the  photo-agency  responsible  for  the  photograph,  Big  Pictures  Limited.  After  lengthy 
litigation, the Court of Appeal found that the taking and publication of the photographs were 
an arguable breach of his Ms Rowling’s son’s right to private life.20 But in the period between 
issuing the claim and receiving judgment from the Court of Appeal, other titles continued 
to  take  and  publish  intrusive  photographs  of  her  children:  the  Daily  Mirror  published  a 
photograph of her daughter as a baby,21 and The Sun and the Daily Mail published long-lens 
photographs of her three children, taken while the family were on holiday in the USA.22

2.17  Clause 6 of the PCC Code requires editors not to use the fame, notoriety or position of a 
parent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child’s private life, but it 
appears that in the case of Ms Rowling’s children, this was the only justification for the pursuit 
and publication of their photos. In the same way as Ms Church objected, in particular, to her 
career  choice  impacting  on  the  privacy  of  her  parents,  Ms  Rowling  objected  to  her  fame 
impacting on the privacy of her children. She said:23

F

“Any other 18 month old child can expect to be pushed along the street in their buggy 
without the paparazzi taking surreptitious photographs of them for the purpose of 
publication in a national newspaper. I have to question why the position should be 
any different for my son. The only difference that exists is that my son has a mother 
who is well known and is of interest to the press.”

2.18  Ms Rowling explained the impact on her children of more than a decade’s intrusion by press 

photographers as follows:24

“The  actions  of  the  paparazzi  have  had  a  real  impact  on  my  children.  My  eldest 
daughter regularly became upset at being accosted in this way and, as is the way 
when a child sees his or her parents upset, was also upset because I was upset. The 
requirement to hide under blankets in cars so as not to be photographed was also 
very unsettling and stressful for her. As for my son, despite being just less than two 
years old at the time of the litigation concerning him, he was confused by the constant 
presence of photographers outside his home and unsettled by the tension of the adults 
around him, in particular as they tried to shield him from being photographed”.

2.19  Ms Rowling’s complaints about harassment by paparazzi and other press photographers were 
echoed by several other witnesses to the Inquiry; their evidence is dealt with in more detail 
below. However Ms Rowling’s complaints were not limited to photographers. Journalists too 
used intrusive methods to obtain stories about Ms Rowling and her children. In one of the

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicmore disconcerting examples provided, a journalist arranged for a letter, addressed to Ms 
Rowling, to be placed in her five year old daughter’s schoolbag.25 Ms Rowling’s response was 
one of justifiable anger at the invasion of her daughter’s privacy.

2.20  Ms Rowling’s second significant complaint related to the publication of details of her address 
and private information about her home, with apparently no regard for the consequences 
of such publication, and no regard for any public interest in doing so. In January 2005, the 
Scottish Daily Mail published the full address of Ms Rowling’s Scottish property.26 In July 2005, 
the Daily Mirror published the street names and photographs of three of her properties in 
England  and  Scotland,  and  published  the  locations,  and  details,  of  security  features  that 
had  been  installed.27  Understandably  concerned  by  the  publication  of  information  that 
was  not  only  private,  but  which  also  jeopardised  the  security  of  her  home,  Ms  Rowling’s 
representatives complained to the PCC. The complaint was upheld in part.28

2.21 

2.22 

In  2007,  the  Daily  Mirror,  the  Daily  Record,  and  the  Scottish  Mail  on  Sunday  published 
photographs and information about Ms Rowling’s Scottish home, including descriptions of 
the property, sufficient to identify its precise location.29 Once again, Ms Rowling complained 
to the PCC. That complaint was rejected on the grounds that the information published was 
already available in the public domain.30 It is not necessary to revisit that ruling here, but it is 
notable that in considering the complaint, the PCC apparently gave no consideration to the 
public interest in the further publication of this information, and it is difficult to see what real 
justification there might be.

In  the  context  of  Ms  Rowling’s  clear  and  unambiguous  desire  for  privacy,  and  where  Ms 
Rowling had previously had a complaint upheld for the publication of very similar material, 
the decision of some titles to publish information which revealed her address, demonstrates 
what appears to be a casual disregard for her privacy, and a carelessness with regard to the 
consequences of publishing private information. It is consistent with the evidence in relation 
to her attempts to protect the privacy of her children: with regard to both the privacy of her 
children and her home, sections of the press chose to ignore the fact that she had consistently 
and unequivocally sought to protect her privacy.

2.23  The evidence provided by the actor Steve Coogan shed further light on a tendency within 
sections of the press to treat individuals without dignity or respect. Mr Coogan has a personal 
life which, by his own admission, may not command the moral approval of all.31 However, his 
evidence was that he had never sought to set himself up as a “model of morality”, nor had he 
sought fame as such. Instead, he has pursued a career as a comedian, writer, and actor and it 
is that choice alone which has brought him into the public eye.32 While it may be correct that 
some people in the public eye trade on their wholesome image or status as a family man, that 
is not the case with Mr Coogan.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF2.24  Despite this, sections of the press have treated his private life as fair game for publication. He 
has been the subject of numerous “kiss and tell” stories and lurid exposes. In 1996, the Daily 
Mirror published two such stories, having paid a woman with whom he was having an affair 
to “tell all”. While investigating the stories, journalists door-stepped the pregnant mother of 
his child and door-stepped, or otherwise harassed, several members of his family. Shortly 
afterwards, in relation to a similar story, a journalist from the same title called the great-
grandmother of his daughter asking her to “spill the beans” about Mr Coogan’s relationship 
with her granddaughter.33

2.25  One  example  provided  by  Mr  Coogan  of  the  methods  used  to  expose  these  stories  was 
particularly notable. In 2002, Rav Singh, a casual friend of Mr Coogan’s and a journalist at the 
NoTW phoned Mr Coogan to warn him of a proposed NoTW sting. Mr Coogan was told that 
he was to receive a phone call from a woman with whom Mr Coogan was acquainted, and the 
woman would seek to persuade Mr Coogan to disclose intimate details of his life. However, 
the woman would be calling from the office of the editor of the NoTW with the intention of 
publishing the details of the conversation. Having been tipped off, Mr Coogan did not disclose 
any intimate details during that conversation. However, two years later Mr Singh called him 
to “negotiate” an article to be published the following day about another of Mr Coogan’s 
intimate relationships. Mr Singh offered to omit certain more embarrassing parts of the story 
if Mr Coogan admitted and discussed other aspects. Trusting Mr Singh’s integrity after his 
2002 experience, Mr Coogan did discuss the relationship in some detail with Mr Singh.

F

2.26  At the end of the conversation, however, the editor of the NoTW called Mr Coogan’s publicist 
to inform him that the entire conversation had been recorded and all of the details disclosed 
would be published, including those that Mr Singh had agreed not to publish. As Mr Coogan 
noted,  the  promises  not  to  publish  certain  elements  of  the  story  appeared  to  have  been 
offered  simply  to  induce  Mr  Coogan  to  reveal  even  more  about  the  story.34  Mr  Coogan’s 
expressed his view of the incident as follows:35

“I don’t think it was a malicious personal vendetta against me. My feeling is that 
it was a dispassionate sociopathic act by those who operate in an amoral universe 
where they are never accountable.”

2.27  No clear public interest justification has been offered for the many stories published about 
Mr Coogan’s sex life. The stories are mere tittle-tattle. But as Mr Coogan noted, such gossip 
is not necessarily harmless and, even when true, can be extremely damaging to the parties 
involved, as well as innocent third parties.36 When untrue, for instance in the case of the Daily 
Mail’s report that Mr Coogan was responsible for the attempted suicide of another actor, 
such invasions of private life can be extremely damaging indeed;37 this is dealt with in more 
detail below in the section on inaccurate and defamatory reporting.38

2.28  The evidence to the Inquiry from ex-footballer Garry Flitcroft highlighted the degree to which 
accurate  reporting  of  private  “tittle  tattle”  can  be  extremely  damaging  to  innocent  third 
parties,  as  much  as  to  the  subjects  of  the  stories  themselves.  Mr  Flitcroft  played  football

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicfor Premiership club Blackburn Rovers, but told the Inquiry that he had never sold a story 
to a celebrity magazine, never endorsed any products in his own name, never attended any 
celebrity functions, or made public pronouncements about his family life. He was, put simply, 
an old fashioned footballer, focused solely on football.39

2.29  Mr  Flitcroft  was  married,  but  had  engaged  in  two  intimate  affairs.  At  some  point  during 
2001, one of the women with whom he had been involved threatened to sell her story of 
their relationship, unless he paid her a sum of money. In essence, Mr Flitcroft says he was 
blackmailed, but refused to pay the woman any money and as a consequence she sold her 
story to the People.40

2.30  Mr  Flitcroft  sought  an  injunction  to  prevent  publication.  It  is  not  necessary  to  review  the 
lengthy  litigation  which  ensued,  save  to  say  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  lifted  an  injunction 
initially imposed by the High Court on the grounds that, in all the circumstances of the case, 
freedom of the press should prevail over Mr Flitcroft’s right to private life.41 It is not for this 
Inquiry to review the rights or wrongs of that judgment42 but what is of interest is first, the 
conduct of the People during the course of the litigation and second, the apparent lack of 
consideration  of  the  consequences  of  publication  on  Mr  Flitcroft  and  his  family  by  those 
responsible for publication.

2.31  As to the first, the People responded to the interim injunction granted by the High Court 
by conducting what seems to have been an investigative exercise into other aspects of Mr 
Flitcroft’s private life. As Mr Flitcroft noted, “it seemed that details of my affair… were of huge 
interest to the paper and they were doing everything they could to add colour to their existing 
story by trying to dig up more dirt on me.”43 The paper’s investigations uncovered the second 
affair  and,  after  Mr  Flitcroft  declined  to  pay  the  woman  involved  £5,000  not  to  disclose 
her story, she sold her story to the People.44 Additionally, although the interim injunction 
prevented publication of the story, Mr Flitcroft recalled that the People published sufficient 
details of the original story to spark intense speculation as to which Premiership footballer 
was the subject of the story. Rumour, and leaks from sports journalists, led many people to 
conclude the story was about Mr Flitcroft long before the story was published.45

2.32  Whether the revelation of Mr Flitcroft’s identity was deliberate or not, and whether or not 
the People’s further investigations were part of a “dirt digging” exercise as suspected by Mr 
Flitcroft, the response of the newspaper to Mr Flitcroft’s attempt to prevent publication does 
at least appear to have been consistent with a practice identified later in this Report whereby 
parts of the press seek to intimidate, attack or punish those who challenge the right of the 
press to publish what they choose.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF2.33  When the injunction was lifted by the Court of Appeal, publication of the story by the People 
had a devastating effect on the lives of Mr Flitcroft and his family. Between 20 and 25 journalists 
and photographers congregated outside Mr and Mrs Flitcroft’s home. Other journalists went 
to  the  homes  of  other  family  members,  including  that  of  Mrs  Flitcroft’s  father  who  was 
suffering from Parkinson’s disease and who found the episode extremely distressing.46 In the 
months that followed, Mrs Flitcroft was forced to stop taking her children to school to avoid 
journalists and photographers while on the school run. Mr and Mrs Flitcroft’s marriage broke 
down.47 Mr Flitcroft said that, even today, his children suffer teasing and abuse in relation to 
the stories.48

2.34  According to Mr Flitcroft, the impact on his father was catastrophic. A long term sufferer of 
depression, he found it very difficult to deal with the press coverage about his son. Having 
attended every football match since his son was aged seven, he stopped going to football 
matches to avoid the humiliation of listening to the chants and mockery from other fans. 
Mr Flitcroft believed that his failure to attend football matches after the publication of the 
story was a significant factor in the worsening of his depression, which tragically ended in his 
suicide in 2008.49

2.35  These facts are important because they provide an insight into the personal consequences 
of what is often described as “tittle tattle” and often thought of as “harmless fun”. The risk 
of  such  personal  consequences  should  not  necessarily  prevent  publication,  but  it  should, 
at least, require a degree of thought before publication. The evidence provided by former 
People editor, Neil Wallis, suggested that there was no genuine consideration of the potential 
consequences of publication on the lives of Mr Flitcroft and his family. When pressed on the 
factors which were considered prior to publication, Mr Wallis was unable to recall any of the 
specific factors, other than the fact that Mr Flitcroft was a footballer and therefore a role 
model. He repeatedly played down the significance of the story, saying that it was “not a big 
story.”50 But that misses the point.

F

2.36  A run-of-the-mill “kiss and tell” may not be a big story to a newspaper, but it will always be 
a big story to the subjects of the story and their families. Although Mr Wallis implied that 
publication had beneficial consequences for Mrs Flitcroft because it resulted in her discovery 
of her husband’s affair,51 his comment only reinforced the view that no proper consideration 
had been given, before or after publication, to the real consequences of publishing the story. 
Mrs Flitcroft did discover her husband’s affair, but in the gaze of the tabloid press, hounded by 
photographers, and forced to hide from public. It is difficult to believe that she would thank 
the newspaper for its service.

2.37  Further examples of this cultural indifference, within sections of the press, to the dignity and 
privacy of individuals were provided by the actor Hugh Grant. Over almost two decades, Mr 
Grant’s private life has been the subject of intense press scrutiny. He has been a victim of 
defamation, phone hacking and harassment by journalists and paparazzi, issues which are

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicdealt with in more detail at various places elsewhere. In addition, newspapers have published 
his private medical information: in 1996, the Daily Mirror published a report of his visit to 
Charing Cross hospital, and cited his condition and treatment;52 in March 2011, both The Sun 
and the Express published details of Mr Grant’s visit to Chelsea and Westminster hospital, 
and  they  too  reported  the  treatment  he  received.53  In  neither  case  was  there  any  public 
interest in publishing this private medical information.

2.38  Consistent with the complaints made by other witnesses, Mr Grant noted that it is not only 
him, styled by the press as a celebrity, who is affected by the intrusive attentions of the press: 
his girlfriends and their children have also been affected.54 When his then girlfriend’s father 
died in 1996, two journalists who had never met the deceased man turned up at the funeral, 
presumably looking for a story about Mr Grant but claiming to want to “pay their respects.”55 
Most recently, after the birth of his child to Tinglan Hong, the new mother experienced quite 
extraordinary levels of harassment by press and paparazzi. Ms Hong feared for her own safety 
and that of her child and, despite Mr Grant’s pleas, the harassment continued until the High 
Court issued an injunction preventing photographers from congregating near her house.

2.39  The justification for the press intrusion Mr Grant has experienced over the last two decades 
is unclear. Gordon Smart, the showbiz editor of The Sun, told the Inquiry that the fact of Mr 
Grant’s celebrity alone justified the publication of his private medical information.56 It was a 
surprising approach, which revealed a lack of respect for the privacy of anyone who might be 
considered a celebrity. Paul Dacre, the editor in chief of the Daily Mail, put it another way in 
claiming that Mr Grant “had spent his life invading his own privacy, exposing every intimate 
detail of his life”.57 While he did not go so far as to suggest that Mr Grant’s private life was 
therefore “open season”, he did imply that, as a consequence of Mr Grant’s public disclosures 
of elements of his private life, the press could, with justification, investigate and report on his 
private life in significant detail. But there are real problems with that reasoning as well.

2.40  First, although Mr Grant is an actor, and is by the nature of his career in the public eye, he 
does not appear to have courted celebrity or fame as some actors have. Indeed, his evidence 
was that he had given only two interviews to British newspapers in the last 17 years and did 
not employ a publicist in the UK.58 Although he accepted that he had spoken publicly about 
his desire to have a child, and had made remarks to the effect that he understands the public’s 
interest in the personal lives of actors, the evidence provided to the Inquiry did not, in my 
view, support the conclusion that Mr Grant had “spent his life invading his own privacy”.59

2.41 

Instead,  the  evidence  revealed  an  actor  who  had,  on  occasion  (mostly,  but  not  entirely, 
in  the  course  of  interviews  he  was  contractually  bound  to  provide  in  order  to  satisfy  the 
publicity requirements of the films in which he appeared), spoken about his personal life in 
a generally flippant or humorous manner, sometimes exposing a little more of himself than 
on other occasions. Unsurprisingly, he had also attended public events with girlfriends, and

been photographed with them. But none of the evidence, taken individually or collectively, 
indicated a man who had spent his life “invading his own privacy ”. I do not deny that some 
so-called ‘celebrities’ could legitimately be accused of that. In Chapter 1 of this Part of the 
Report,  I  acknowledged  that  there  is  a  class  of  person  with  a  public  profile  –  those  who 
actively engage in the ‘celebrity industry’ – who may enjoy a lower level of protection when 
it comes to privacy. I also accept, and fully recognise, that a substantial amount of celebrity 
reporting in the popular press concerns this class of people. However, in my view at least, Mr 
Grant does not fall within that class.

2.42  Second, even if it were true that Mr Grant had previously disclosed a multitude of genuinely 
private details about his life, or had sold stories of his private life to particular titles, it does 
not necessarily follow that he would be “fair game” for the press at large to publish further 
details without consent. As Mr Grant put it:60

“I have heard the defence quite frequently from tabloid papers: “Oh, well, you know, 
if you have ever talked about your private life, then you have no defence, you have no 
right to an expectation of privacy”, which I think is absurd. Because anyone – I mean, 
as I told you earlier, I think I’ve only done two interviews ever with the British press, 
but when anyone does do an interview, it is, after all, a bargain. The press of that 
paper gets a boost in sales, they hope, and the person who’s giving the interview gets 
a bit of noise about their forthcoming project. And like any barter, when it’s over, it’s 
over. If I sell you a pint of milk for 50p, I would not expect you to come to me forever 
afterwards, saying, “You slut, you sold me milk once. I can now help myself to your 
milk forever.” I would think you were mad.”

2.43  Finally, even if Mr Grant can have no reasonable expectation of privacy himself, that does not 
justify the collateral damage to, or the harassment of, and intrusion into the private lives of, 
those close to him.

2.44  Again,  it  seems  that  the  intrusive  reporting  that  Mr  Grant  spoke  of  is  part  of  a  cultural 
indifference within parts of the press to individual privacy and dignity. That manifests itself 
most frequently in the celebrity press, where individual private lives are treated, at least to 
some extent, as commodities. The evidence given by Miss Church, Ms Rowling, Mr Coogan 
and Mr Grant support this conclusion, as does the similar evidence heard by the Inquiry from 
Sienna  Miller,61  Sheryl  Gascoigne,62  Anne  Diamond63  and  Heather  Mills.64  But  the  cultural 
indifference to privacy and dignity does not apply only to celebrities or those in the public 
eye. In addition to the experiences described by the Dowlers, the McCanns and Christopher 
Jefferies, the Inquiry heard evidence from, or about, numerous others who were not public 
figures  but  who  had  experienced  seriously  intrusive  coverage  and/or  treatment  from  the 
press.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.45  The evidence provided by HJK, discussed in Chapter 3 above, was a prime example of this. 
So  too  was  the  evidence  of  Baroness  Hollins.  In  2005,  Baroness  Hollins’  daughter  Abigail 
Witchall, a private individual with no public persona, was stabbed and critically injured: she 
was a victim of crime, pure and simple. Although the majority of the press covered the story in 
a compassionate and sensitive way, a section of the press behaved irresponsibly and without 
regard to the privacy and dignity of the family.

2.46  On  the  first  day  after  the  attack,  a  group  of  journalists  congregated  in  the  family  garden, 
before  being  required  to  leave  by  police.  Other  journalists  camped  outside  the  hospital 
where Abigail was undergoing treatment, or pretended to be visitors in the waiting room.65 
The intrusion and surveillance continued: a year later, a long lens photograph was published 
in  The  Sun  of  the  entire  family,  while  on  a  private  pilgrimage  to  Lourdes;66  even  in  2010, 
when Abigail had given birth to another baby, Daily Mail reporters were stationed outside her 
house on a shift pattern waiting for sight of Abigail or the baby.67

2.47  The  family  also  endured  the  publication  of  intimate  and  private  details.  Reporting  on  the 
incident, the NoTW published the headline, “Exclusive: new shock in Abi attack – knife mum 
was pregnant”. While accurate, the truth was that Abigail was only five weeks pregnant and 
was unaware of the fact. She had certainly not consented to the publication of the fact of her 
pregnancy and it appears no family member had done so either.68

2.48  The experience described by Baroness Hollins in relation to the reporting of her daughter’s 
attack was echoed by evidence given to the Inquiry by several other witnesses who complained 
of a breach of privacy and harassment in the aftermath of a death or attack; that evidence is 
considered in more detail at Section 6 below.

2.49  The Inquiry also received evidence about a series of stories published in the NoTW about 
Bob and Sue Firth. Their evidence was that they ran a naturist B&B in Dorset, which had 
been anonymously inspected by the English Tourist Board and rated as highly commended. 
Shortly after receiving that rating, the NoTW journalist, Neville Thurlbeck, orchestrated an 
undercover sting operation and reported that the Firths were running not just a naturist B&B, 
but a brothel at which Sue Firth would have sex with guests while Bob Firth looked on.69

2.50  The Firths’ evidence was that there was no truth in the story. At no stage had Sue Firth engaged 
in sexual activity with guests, and sexual activity was no part of the naturist element of the 
B&B.70 However, they claimed that Mr Thurlbeck had entrapped them: he had cajoled and 
paid the Firths to perform a sex act while Mr Thurlbeck looked on. On their evidence, that had 
only happened as a consequence of Mr Thurlbeck’s entrapment and had never previously, or 
subsequently, occurred at the B&B. Nonetheless, as a consequence of the articles published 
in the NoTW, the Firths were forced to close the B&B.71

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

2.51  Mr Thurlbeck was given an opportunity to comment on the Firths’ evidence but declined, 
instead  relying  on  a  PCC  ruling  that  had  found  the  story  to  be  “justified”  in  the  public 
interest.72 That ruling is available but, to say the least, is opaque at best. No doubt on the 
basis that the PCC is not set up to resolve issues of fact, it makes no finding on the Firths’ core 
complaint that much of the story was fabricated. Without making that decision, however, 
the PCC considered itself able to reach a finding on the public interest of the story. But if it 
was fabricated, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decide that there was any public 
interest in it. Despite being pressed to explain the public interest in the story, Mr Thurlbeck 
simply refused to do so.

2.52 

It  was  clear  from  the  evidence  of  Tom  Crone,  the  legal  advisor  at  the  NoTW  at  the  time, 
that Mr Thurlbeck neither requested nor received any advice on the public interest of the 
story before engaging in the subterfuge, nor did he request or receive such advice prior to 
publication.73 Mr Crone’s evidence to the Inquiry was that the story was tacky and the breach 
of privacy involved was not justified.74 The fact that the newspaper’s own lawyer considered 
that the breach of privacy was not in the public interest is revealing, as is the fact that nobody 
thought it appropriate to ask him in the first place.

2.53  Overall, and notwithstanding the concerns which have been expressed, it would not be right 
to reach any further conclusions on the Firth story, for a number of reasons. It occurred a 
considerable time ago now, and the evidence is both murky and heavily disputed. The Inquiry 
received a witness statement from the Firths but it was not tested in oral evidence. To have 
done so would have occupied a disproportionate amount of Inquiry time in circumstances 
where Mr Thurlbeck had already made clear that he would refuse to give his account of this 
story. Given that he had been arrested in connection with alleged phone hacking offences 
in the summer of 2011 (and has since been charged), it would have been difficult to compel 
him to engage with the Inquiry on these issues, and probably unnecessary. Notwithstanding 
all these caveats, it is possible, at least tentatively, to conclude that prior to publication, the 
NoTW had insufficient regard to the privacy of the Firths or the consequences of publication 
on their lives.

2.54  Assessed as a whole, the examples referred to so far in this Chapter (including those merely 
footnoted) suggest a culture of indifference to individual privacy and dignity, at least within 
parts of the press. But the evidence supporting that conclusion is not limited to this section, 
and  can  be  seen  throughout  the  Chapter:  the  evidence  of  phone  hacking,  email  hacking, 
blagging, harassment and surveillance all lead to the same conclusion.

2.55  Evidence  by  lawyers  who  represent  victims  of  privacy  intrusion  also  supported  that  same 
conclusion. Graham Shear, a partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner, told the Inquiry that 
in the last 15 years tabloid newspapers had specifically targeted celebrities and sportsmen 
to  generate  front  page  exposés.75  The  use  of  surveillance,  subterfuge,  or  the  payment  of 
an agent provocateur had increased in what he considered was a response to commercial 
pressures  which  required  sensationalist  exposes  to  generate  sales.76  His  evidence  was 
supported by solicitor Mark Thomson who considered that, since the late 1980s, there had 
been “a widespread culture of the illegal obtaining and use of private information by popular

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicnewspapers.”77 He noted that since that time, his clients had regularly been photographed 
and/or  followed  and  stories  had  been  published  or  threatened  in  circumstances  where 
information as to their movements or private lives could not have been obtained Iegally.78

2.56  Mr Shear’s evidence was that the increasingly intrusive techniques used by parts of the tabloid 
press to generate increasingly sensational stories were the result less of an indifference to 
private lives and reputation, and more the result of a calculation of the financial risk of a 
privacy or defamation claim against the potential profits that a story might generate. On that 
basis, he considered that some titles would publish stories likely to result in a substantial 
increase in circulation, notwithstanding that the story was likely to be an unlawful invasion of 
privacy, or even defamatory.79

2.57  There is some further evidence of unethical or unlawful publication based on the calculation 
of legal risk versus potential profits. For example, Piers Morgan recollected in his book The 
Insider that, prior to publishing a double page spread based on copy unlawfully lifted from 
another newspaper, he had specifically asked for legal advice on the likely damages to be 
awarded for the lifting, before concluding “50 grand would have been well worth paying for a 
front page and two spreads inside and the bigger sales revenue it would bring.”80

2.58  However, although there is material to suggest that financial calculations play a part in the 
willingness of parts of the press to use intrusive investigative techniques or to publish stories 
involving egregious breaches of privacy, it is not clear that most of the complaints made by 
victims of these practices can be explained by a calculated approach to assessing financial 
risk against potential profit. Instead, it seems more likely that, in the majority of cases of 
unjustified invasions of privacy, the simple fact is that the privacy and dignity of subjects of 
stories are not considered at all or, alternatively, are not sufficiently weighed in the balance 
prior to investigating or publishing the story.

2.59  The evidence heard from some editors, journalists and executives supported that view. At its 
extreme, the cultural indifference to privacy was encapsulated in Paul McMullan’s observation 
that “privacy is for paedos… no-one else needs it. Privacy is evil.”81 While others may not have 
expressed themselves in the same terms, there seemed to be at least some agreement from 
other editors and journalists that privacy was not a matter worthy of significant protection.

2.60  Kelvin MacKenzie recalled that, as editor of The Sun, he did not have any regard to issues of 

privacy.82 He said:83

“I didn’t spend too much time pondering the ethics of how a story was gained, nor 
over-worry about whether to publish or not. If we believed the story to be true and we 
felt Sun readers should know the facts, we published it and left it to them to decide if 
we had done the right thing.”

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF2.61  Although Mr MacKenzie left the Sun in 1994 and his evidence cannot necessarily be taken 
as reflecting attitudes prevailing today, his views chimed with Mr McMullan’s, and were not 
dissimilar to some of the views expressed by proprietors, editors and journalists.

2.62  As previously noted, the proprietor of the Express Group, Richard Desmond gave evidence 
that his newspapers “are in a business to give readers/viewers what they want to read and 
watch and as long as it is legal that is what we aim to do. We do not talk about ethics or morals 
because it’s a very fine line, and everybody’s ethics are different.”84 Mr Desmond said that the 
bottom line for whether or not to publish a story was the reputation of his newspapers.85

2.63  That approach from the proprietor may or may not have influenced the thinking of the editor 
of  the  Daily  Express,  Peter  Hill,  when  considering  whether  to  publish  38  defamatory  and 
intrusive stories about the McCanns. Mr Hill’s evidence to the Inquiry betrayed a distinct lack 
of consideration for the dignity and privacy of the McCanns, and showed instead a focus on 
the circulation of his newspaper.86 Despite his knowledge that his reporters on the ground in 
Portugal had very real concerns about the truth of the articles they were writing, Mr Hill told 
the Inquiry that he was not troubled by the decision to publish because, in his view, there was 
a clamour for information about the Madeleine McCann story and his readers wanted to read 
about it.87 His evidence suggested a remarkable elision between what was justified in the 
public interest, and what would interest his readership. Such elision leaves little room for the 
protection of privacy if a readership is interested in reading about the private lives of others.

F

2.64  But Mr Hill was not alone in holding a conception of the public interest that was essentially 
defined by what interested the readership. The then editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver, 
confirmed that her view was that the public interest test was often drawn too narrowly by the 
courts and the PCC and that the public were ultimately the best barometer of what was in the 
public interest. She confirmed that her approach came close to equating the public interest 
with  what  interested  the  public,  although  she  denied  that  there  was  a  complete  overlap 
between the two.88

2.65  The Daily Express’s Hugh Whittow and the Daily Star’s Dawn Neesom considered the readers’ 
views to be a primary factor in the consideration of whether to publish private information.89 
Similarly, the Daily Mirror’s then editor Richard Wallace thought the public interest was very 
strongly influenced by what interests the public. In the context of the Christopher Jefferies 
story, he said:90

“What the public are interested in is a central tenet of public interest. The public were 
interested in this story… Acting within the framework of the PCC Code, I considered 
publishing these stories to be in the public interest because the public wanted to read 
about the story.”

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.66  The  story  about  Mr  Jefferies  is  a  prime  example  of  why  the  elision  of  the  public  interest 
with what interests the public is dangerous. It may well interest the public to read private, 
scandalous and defamatory material about a suspect to a murder, but it is clearly not in the 
wider public interest for newspapers to act in contempt of court, let alone erroneously to 
destroy a man’s reputation.

2.67  A consideration of what interests a readership must of course form the basis of any editorial 
decision to publish or not to publish material, but where the material involves private rights, 
the decision on whether to publish must also include a consideration of the consequences 
of publication on the subjects of stories and on the wider public interest. Richard Peppiatt 
provided helpful evidence on this point when he noted:91

“Yesterday,  Hugh  Whittow,  in  the  Commons  Select  Committee  on  Privacy,  he  said 
over the Chris Jefferies case, which I thought was really cold – he said, “We make 
mistakes, we paid out, we move on.” Well, Chris Jefferies doesn’t move on. His life 
has been irreparably changed and that is the attitude: “We make mistakes.” But no 
one wants to take responsibility for those mistakes and the reason is because there’s 
not an individual who you can point the finger to and say is responsible, because it’s 
a culture.”

2.68  A  failure  to  consider  the  personal  consequences  of  publishing  information  about  an 
individual’s private life was evident in Mr Dacre’s evidence. The Daily Mail’s coverage of the 
attack on Ms Witchall included an article suggesting a spurious link between Ms Witchall’s 
attack and one suffered by her brother some years earlier. Included as part of that article 
was  the  name  and  a  photograph  of  Ms  Witchall’s  brother,  an  indication  that  he  suffered 
from learning difficulties and the names of his attackers. Baroness Hollins complained to the 
Inquiry that the article was an unjustified breach of her vulnerable son’s privacy, which also 
placed him at risk of reprisals from his convicted attackers.92 Mr Dacre defended the article 
robustly:93

“Can  I  say  as  strongly  as  I  can  that  this,  I  believe,  shows  how  the  Inquiry  doesn’t 
understand how newspapers work. To my mind, this is a story and a feature handled 
with superb sensitivity. I’ve been through it. I think it’s written with massive compassion. 
I think the family come out of it wonderfully. The love between the brother and sister 
is extraordinary. The religious faith of the family comes across. The learning disability 
– the mother and the son wrote a book about that, on how to handle court cases for 
people with learning disabilities. I think that’s a wonderful message to get out to the 
public. I think that was an extraordinary story.”

2.69  While the story may well have been extraordinary, written sensitively, and may well have 
contained a wonderful message, those factors do not change the fact that the story involved 
the disclosure of sensitive information which caused significant upset to the family, and was 
based  in  large  part  on  the  spurious  suggestion  of  a  link  between  two  obviously  unlinked 
attacks. I do not criticise Mr Dacre for the decision to publish the article, which he considered 
to be justified in the public interest. He is absolutely entitled to his own view on where the 
balance between private rights and public interests lay in respect of this (and other) stories.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFBut  Mr  Dacre’s  robust  defence  of  the  article  failed  to  engage  with  the  genuine  concerns 
raised by Baroness Hollins. Indeed, Mr Dacre appeared not to understand why the family 
would have been upset by the article at all.94 Given that Mr Dacre did not engage with the 
actual consequences of the story for the family, and their response to it, it seems probable 
that insufficient consideration was given to the potential consequences of the story, or its 
impact on the family, prior to publication.

2.70  Mr Dacre adopted a similarly robust approach in defending the publication of a defamatory 
story containing erroneous information about alleged drunken behaviour of the actor Neil 
Morrissey.95  Mr  Dacre  accepted  that  the  story  was  inaccurate  and  defamatory,  but  was 
unwilling to accept Mr Morrissey’s evidence that the story was hurtful to him. Moreover, 
he argued strongly that, if true, the story would have been in the public interest because 
Mr Morrissey was a famous actor, because the story interested his readership and because, 
at the time, the Daily Mail believed that Mr Morrissey had acted irresponsibly.96 The final 
element of that justification – irresponsible behaviour – accorded with a more general point 
which  Mr Dacre accepted, that  his  newspaper  felt  justified  to  publish  private information 
about public figures when they “erred” from the traditional virtues of family life, traditional 
matrimony and traditional values.97

2.71  What was concerning about Mr Dacre’s evidence on both the Ms Witchall and Mr Morrissey 
stories was not his editorial judgment on whether the articles should have been published 
or not. Instead, the concern related to Mr Dacre’s unwillingness to entertain the idea that 
each of these stories might have been hurtful, upsetting and/or damaging to the individuals 
involved. If such a possibility is not even recognised post publication, despite evidence to the 
contrary from the subjects of the stories, then it seems unlikely to have been the subject of 
any consideration pre-publication.

F

2.72  As part of the body of evidence received from editors and proprietors, Mr Dacre’s evidence 
supported a more general conclusion that there is a cultural unwillingness in parts of the 
press to consider the consequences of publication on the individuals involved. Some of the 
evidence from photo-editors and photo agencies discussed in Section 5 below, also supports 
that conclusion. To reiterate the point: the fact that a story might be hurtful, damaging or 
intrusive to the subjects of a story is not necessarily a reason not to publish that story. It may 
not even be a reason to amend the story. But it is difficult to see why the consequences on 
the individuals who are likely to be affected by publication should not both be relevant and 
factored into the overall decision.

2.73 

In  part,  this  cultural  unwillingness  stems  from  inadequate  systems  for  considering  and 
recording  public  interest  decisions.  Assessing  the  evidence  as  a  whole,  and  as  more  fully 
discussed below, it appears that, until recently, in house legal advisors were rarely asked to 
advise on privacy issues at all, but focused almost exclusively on libel. Although legal advisors 
are now asked to advise on privacy issues more regularly, the final decision on publication 
(rightly) rests with the editorial team. It appears that, in the majority of titles, there is no 
formal system in place for that team to consider, decide and minute the difficult questions of 
whether publication of private information is in the public interest. Those titles that do have 
such systems have only introduced them very recently.

608

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.74  Although some witnesses feared the bureaucratic burden that such systems might impose, 
those fears are surely misplaced. Only a few stories raise issues of this nature and a single 
page record of the factors weighing against and in favour of publication, along with a record of 
the reasons for the conclusion reached, would suffice and be no more than many editors said 
reflected their thought processes. The adoption of such a system for reaching public interest 
decisions is, however, important for two main reasons. First, such decision-making process 
focuses the mind and ensures that all relevant factors, including the privacy and dignity of 
the individual, as well as the potential consequences of, and public interest in, publication 
are properly considered. The second reason is that a formal, written decision making process 
can  assist  titles  defending  subsequent  complaints  or  litigation,  where  the  absence  of  any 
contemporaneous record of decision can result in accusations of ex post facto reasoning to 
justify what was in reality an unconsidered interference with private life.

2.75  This approach may well cause Mr Dacre to consider that his expressed view (that the Inquiry 
does not understand how newspapers work) is proved, but it is important to make the point 
that both the approach and the reasons underlying it rely only on the law of privacy as it 
has been explained by the courts and on the standards identified by the press themselves 
expressed through the Editors’ Code of Practice. Newspapers have to work within the law and 
if the Code does not represent the way in which newspapers carry out their business, then 
the high regard which editors have for it is misplaced.

2.76  Although significant improvements can and should be made (and in many cases, have already 
been  made)  to  internal  systems  for  considering  and  recording  public  interest  decisions, 
systemic changes alone will not address the real issues identified above. In my view, parts 
of the press require a cultural, rather than a systemic, change to ensure that the privacy and 
dignity of individuals is appropriately respected, and to ensure that the public interest in, 
and consequences of, and publication are considered when titles decide how and whether to 
investigate, and publish, details of individuals’ private lives.

2.77  The need for such a change in culture is all the more urgent in a technological age which allows 
for unprecedented access to private information and unprecedented means to distribute that 
private information. As the Media Standards Trust noted:98

“In the constrained media environment of the twentieth century there were practical 
limitations  on  the  press’  ability  to  report  on  people’s  private  lives.  There  was,  for 
example,  only  a  limited  amount  of  material  the  press  could  access  –  in  terms  of 
photographs, video, phone conversations etc. There were also practical constraints 
on what the papers could and could not publish. They were not able to publish video 
or audio, and they could only publish as much as could fit between the front and back 
pages of the print paper.
For the most part these practical constraints no longer exist. The press – or anyone 
else – can access huge amounts of personal material themselves and through others. 
A reporter can legitimately find personal information published  on the internet or 
source  recorded  audio/video  from  members  of  the  public.  Equally,  a  reporter  can 
illegitimately access private material or illicitly record personal moments or private 
phone calls. The papers can then publish as much of this material as they like – in text, 
audio, or video – online. Or anyone else can publish this information, on a website, on 
a blog, on a social networking site like Facebook, on twitter, on a wiki. The information 
can then ripple rapidly outwards across the net.”

In this context, it is vital that the press in general develops, and/or maintains, internal cultures 
in which respect for individual privacy and dignity is central, without impacting adversely on 
genuine investigative journalism. In the absence of such cultures, the temptation to use the 
technology that is now available to invade privacy and to publish private information, when 
not in the public interest, may be irresistible. It is to the evidence on the use of some of those 
technologies which I now turn.

information
Introduction
This Chapter will now explore the evidence heard by the Inquiry in relation to the practices of 
the press in obtaining private information, the extent to which these practices could properly 
be described as ‘cultural’ rather than sporadic or isolated incidents, and the extent to which 
those working in the media industry were aware that these practices were occurring.

The practices under consideration are known colloquially in the industry as the ‘dark arts’, 
although  this  term  no  doubt  goes  wider  than  the  unlawful  and  unethical  acquisition  of 
private information. The Inquiry received evidence of a general nature about these practices 
from witnesses such as Nick Davies from the Guardian.99 The witness statement of Michelle 
Stanistreet, and her exhibits containing anonymous testimony, included evidence from one 
journalist who had experienced the practices of the dark arts across a range of mid-market, 
tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, and had himself worked with a private investigator on 
a number of stories.

The  witness  explained  to  Ms  Stanistreet  that  investigators  could  provide  surveillance 
services including bugging homes and offices and recording landline phones, Police National 
Computer (PNC) checks to learn about criminal convictions and cautions, and could find up 
to  date  addresses.  These  services  were  provided  in  return  for  cash  delivered  in  rolled  up 
newspapers by journalists. This evidence recalled that, initially, the use of such techniques 
was not widespread in newsrooms but was restricted at that time to a few journalists who 
“had an investigative bent”. However at another title, methods of obtaining information were 
talked about more openly and, in relation to two titles where the witness had worked, there 
were “small coteries of reporters who could and were expected to practice the ’dark arts”.100

Phone
This topic has been addressed in other sections of the Report . However, for reasons of aiding 
the  overall  narrative,  and  because  phone  hacking  amounts  to  one  of  the  most  egregious 
examples  of  unethical  press  practices,  a  relatively  brief  recapitulation  of  the  evidence  is 
provided here.

3.5  Whilst the precise methods by which phone hacking was perpetrated do not require detailed 
explanation,  the  evidence  of  Detective  Inspector  Mark  Maberly  is  worth  noting  at  this 
juncture.101  One  method  of  obtaining  access  to  voicemails  was  referred  to  in  Fleet  Street

folklore as “double whacking”; this worked by one person ringing a mobile phone to engage 
it, and then another person ringing the phone to be directed to the voicemail. With some 
telephone companies there was a prospect of then interrupting the voicemail message and 
being  diverted  into  the  voicemail  account  where  a  PIN  could  be  entered  to  listen  to  the 
messages. As Mr Maberly observed, it would not be possible to use this method on too many 
occasions as it would become difficult to justify repeated spurious calls and this would arouse 
suspicion. The method of voicemail interception used by Glenn Mulcaire, amongst others, 
was  a  more  sophisticated  form  of  voicemail  interception  facilitated  by  calling  into  service 
providers through a unique retrieval number and entering a PIN to listen to message, the PIN 
often having previously been changed or reset to default by the intruder.102

Interestingly, the evidence the Inquiry has received from Vodafone indicates that they were 
apparently unaware of these possibilities until 2006.103 Vodafone is a large company and its 
corporate memory may be difficult to pinpoint. Vodafone’s evidence needs to be considered 
in the context of other material put before the Inquiry, including compelling evidence from 
Steve Nott, which indicated that as early as 1999 the security flaw within the voicemail system 
was known about by at least two service providers.104

News of the World

Little needs to be said about the NoTW’s involvement in phone hacking, given the preceding 
sections of this Report, but a short summary of the evidence canvassed previously is helpful.

Taking together the evidence which has emerged from the prosecution of Mr Mulcaire and Mr 
Goodman, the admissions made by News International in the context of civil claims founded 
upon allegations of phone hacking and what the Inquiry has been told by former employees, 
in my view there is clear evidence that voicemail interception was occurring at NoTW from 
if not slightly before 2000, and probably continued until around 2009.105 It is equally clear 
that these practices were not limited to a single journalist. In opening the Inquiry, Robert 
Jay  QC  described  these  activities  as  amounting  to  a  ‘thriving  cottage  industry’.106  Without 
delving into any of the detail regarding particular journalists or employees of the company, 
which would plainly be inappropriate given the extant criminal proceedings, it would not be 
unfair to describe the practice of voicemail interception within a part or parts of the NoTW 
as cultural.

Daily Mirror

3.9 

The Inquiry has also heard evidence which suggests that phone hacking may not have been 
confined to NoTW, and may have been occurring at other tabloid newspapers, including the 
Daily Mirror. All of this evidence needs to be considered by the Inquiry with great precision, 
as well as a measure of caution, partly because civil claims have been issued in respect of 
allegations of phone hacking at the Daily Mirror,107 but also because it is generally unfair to

name and potentially criticise others in relation to illegal or unethical conduct when the need 
to avoid prejudicing criminal investigations and prosecutions means that I am unable fully to 
investigate or describe what was happening at the NoTW.

In this context, consideration needs to be given first to the evidence relating to the voicemail of 
Heather Mills, which may be summarised as follows. In 2001 a number of voicemail messages 
were left by Sir Paul McCartney on Ms Mills’ mobile phone following a disagreement between 
them. The precise content of the messages is immaterial, save to note that in the messages 
Sir Paul apologised and sought forgiveness from Ms Mills through song. Ms Mills picked up 
the voicemail messages the following day, she recalls the messages were treated as “saved” 
messages, rather than as “new” messages on her voicemail system, which she thought was 
unusual but did not regard as significant at the time. Later that day she was telephoned by 
a former employee of Trinity Mirror Group (TMG) who told her they had heard that she had 
argued with her then partner, who had sung down the phone. Ms Mills responded that the 
only way this could have been known was to listen to her voicemail, to which the journalist 
laughed.108

3.11 

In October 2006 it was reported in an article written by Piers Morgan in the Mail Online that 
he had been played a tape of a voicemail message left for Ms Mills in 2001. The article read 
“Stories soon emerged that the marriage was in trouble. At one stage I was played a tape of 
a message Paul had left for Heather on her mobile phone”.109

3.12  Mr  Morgan  confirmed  in  his  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  that  he  had  listened  to  a  tape  of  a 
voicemail message left for Ms Mills in around 2000 or 2001 when he was editor of the Daily 
Mirror. Mr Morgan was asked to explain his understanding of how the tape had been obtained. 
His evidence was that he had no reason to believe that this had been through an unlawful 
means, and no story had been published by the Daily Mirror based on the tape.110 Mr Morgan 
declined  to  give  any  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  relating  to  the  provenance  of  the  voicemail 
message, the circumstances in which the tape was played to him, or any evidence to the 
effect that Ms Mills had consented to or authorised his actions, invoking the confidentiality 
of his source.111

3.13  Ms Mills confirmed to the Inquiry that she had never played the message described by Mr 
Morgan to anyone, never taken a recording of the messages and that the messages were 
deleted  in  2001.112  Ms  Mills  has  also  confirmed  that  she  never  authorised  Mr  Morgan  to 
access her voicemail, listen to her voicemail or played to Mr Morgan or authorised him, or 
any other person, to listen to a recording of her voicemail messages.113 Ms Mills further told 
the Inquiry that evidence obtained during Operation Weeting proved that private voicemail 
messages of Ms Mills and her sister had been hacked into, albeit that evidence did not relate 
to the taped voicemail message presently under scrutiny.114

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public3.14  When subsequently asked to comment on Ms Mills’ evidence, Mr Morgan placed in issue 
her assertion that she had never played her voicemail messages to anyone, and put before 
the Inquiry a witness statement from John Ferriter (Ms Mill’s agent at the time, and now Mr 
Morgan’s agent) dated 29 October 2012 which claimed that, in 2007, Ms Mills played him 
a recording of a voicemail message left by Sir Paul.115 It is clear from the context that this 
particular message was left very much later than the message to which Mr Morgan’s evidence 
relates (although Mr Ferriter is not specific about this), and for that reason alone is irrelevant 
to the issue the Inquiry is considering. It has been noted that, when asked to comment on 
extracts of Mr Ferriter’s evidence, Ms Mills denied ever having played Mr Ferriter a voicemail 
message.116 Ms Mills reiterated her sworn testimony that the voicemail message Mr Morgan 
described having been left by Sir Paul for Ms Mills in circumstances where “… the couple had 
clearly had a tiff, Heather had fled to India and Paul was pleading for her to come back”, was 
not one which she had played to anyone. Insofar as it does relate to issues directly relevant 
to the Inquiry, I accept the account that Ms Mills has provided.

3.15  The evidence relating to this particular episode cannot be considered in isolation. The Inquiry 
also  heard  evidence  from  Jeremy  Paxman  and  Richard  Wallace  in  relation  the  possibility 
that the voicemail of Ulrika Jonsson had been hacked by the Mirror. Mr Morgan, in his book 
The Insider, described an incident during the period when he was editor where Mr Wallace, 
then the showbusiness editor employed by the Daily Mirror, had come into his office with a 
“wicked grin” on his face and relayed to him a story about the details of Ms Jonsson’s private 
life. Mr Wallace in his evidence explained that this tip off had come from the showbusiness 
team at the Daily Mirror; he accepted that he could not positively assert what the source of 
the tip off was, and acknowledged that it was possible the source was phone hacking.117 Mr 
Morgan subsequently called Ms Jonsson’s agent who had confirmed that the details of the 
story were true.

3.16  As for Mr Paxman, he explained that he attended a lunch at the offices of TMG on or around 
20 September 2002; the lunch was hosted by Sir Victor Blank, the then Chairman of TMG,  
and  the  then  editor  of  the  Sunday  Mirror,  Mr  Morgan.  Ms  Jonsson,  Philip  Green  and  a 
number of others were also present. In the course of conversation he heard Mr Morgan joke 
with Ms Jonsson that he knew the content of conversations between Ms Jonsson and Sven 
Goran Eriksson, with whom Ms Jonsson had had a relationship. Mr Paxman explained that 
Mr Morgan turned to him and asked him whether he had a mobile phone and whether he 
had a security setting on the message facility; he then explained that the way to gain access 
to peoples’ messages was to “go to the factory default setting and press either 0000 or 1234”, 
and further said that if you did not put on your own code, in Mr Morgan’s words, “You’re a 
fool.”118

3.17  This evidence does not establish that Mr Morgan authorised the hacking of voicemails or that 
journalists employed by TMG were indulging in this practice. What it does, however, clearly 
prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was 
sufficiently  unembarrassed  by  what  was  criminal  behaviour  that  he  was  prepared  to  joke 
about it. Whatever other inferences might be drawn from Mr Paxman’s convincing evidence 
on this issue, it is sufficient for present purposes to leave the matter there.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF3.18  The Inquiry also heard evidence from James Hipwell, who was employed as a journalist at the 
Daily Mirror from 1998 to 2000 and worked on the City desk. He sat next to the Daily Mirror’s 
showbiz journalists and explained in his evidence that he was able to see at close hand how 
they  operated.  He  observed  journalists  carrying  out  repeated  privacy  infringements,  by 
hacking into the voicemail systems of celebrities, their friends, publicists and public relations 
executives. Mr Hipwell observed that the openness and frequency of their hacking activities 
gave him the impression that hacking was considered a “bog-standard journalistic tool for 
gathering  information”.  He  explained  how  he  heard  showbiz  journalists  openly  discussing 
what had been heard on voicemails and one of the journalists showed Mr Hipwell how to 
hack into voicemails. He also observed that, on occasions, the journalists would joke about 
having deleted a message from a celebrity’s voicemail to ensure no journalist from The Sun 
would get the same scoop by hacking. Mr Hipwell further explained that he observed this 
conduct  on  a  daily  basis  in  1999  and  a  great  number  of  the  Daily  Mirror’s  showbusiness 
stories would come from phone hacking.119

3.19  Although doubts may exist as to Mr Hipwell’s credibility, given his criminal record and the real 
risk that he bears a grudge towards his former employer, the account he gave to the Inquiry 
on these matters was clear, firm and convincing.120 Mr Hipwell did not name any individual 
journalists, and his evidence cannot do more than serve to demonstrate that phone hacking 
as a practice may well have been occurring at the Mirror titles when Mr Hipwell was working 
there. Mr Morgan denied knowing about the activities described by Mr Hipwell,121 and the 
latter did not say in terms that the editor knew about them.

3.20  The  issue  for  consideration  at  this  stage  is  exactly  what  inferences  the  Inquiry  is  minded 
to draw in relation to Mr Morgan. It is right that the Inquiry is explicit about this, given the 
public concerns which followed the receipt by the Inquiry of Mr Morgan’s oral evidence in 
December 2011 and the prominence given to the reporting of Mr Paxman’s evidence. There 
is no evidence that Mr Morgan hacked into any mobile phone and, because of the approach 
I have adopted, it would be unfair and wrong in principle to reach any conclusion that he 
expressly authorised  the hacking of voicemails  at the Mirror titles or was aware that this 
practice had occurred in any individual case. Further, Mr Morgan has refused to reveal his 
‘confidential source’ in Ms Mills’ case and the Inquiry faces the perennial difficulty of not 
being able to penetrate beneath that refusal.

3.21  For the avoidance of doubt, however, the Inquiry does conclude that the practice of phone 
hacking may well have taken place at the Mirror titles at the time Mr Hipwell was working 
there, that Ms Mills’ voicemail probably was hacked into by someone (albeit it is unnecessary, 
if not impossible, to reach a conclusion as to whether he or she was a Mirror journalist), and 
that it is equally probable that Ms Jonsson’s voicemail was hacked into.

3.22 

It is a separate issue whether Mr Morgan was aware in broad terms of the general practice 
of phone hacking. This issue, touched upon above in relation to the evidence of Mr Paxman, 
will be addressed below under a separate rubric.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicOther publications

3.23 

It should be noted that the evidence heard by the Inquiry relating to phone hacking is not 
confined to NoTW and the Mirror titles. However, the evidence in relation to the use of the 
technique at other titles was limited and problematic. Paul McMullan’s belief was that the 
practice of phone hacking was not limited to the NoTW, but he was unable to provide any 
firm evidence for this belief. Stuart Hoare recalled that his brother Sean had told him that the 
practice was widely used at The Sun122 but, given that this was hearsay evidence, and wholly 
untested, it is difficult to place any substantial weight on it.

3.24  Mark  Lewis,  a  solicitor  and  partner  at  law  firm  Taylor  Hampton,  told  the  Inquiry  that  he 
received a compact disc which had the recording of a conversation between Mr Mulcaire and 
a person working for a newspaper owned by Associated Newspapers Ltd, in which Mr Mulcaire 
was teaching that person how to hack a mobile phone.123 However, it is difficult to see how far 
this evidence goes because, on its own, it does not start to establish that phone hacking was 
practised by anyone at any of these titles. Furthermore, although evidence from Mr Davies124 
and from anonymous journalists whose evidence was related by Ms Stanistreet of the NUJ, 
suggested that phone hacking was being deployed through a range of mid-market, red top 
and broadsheet newspapers,125 this evidence, taken in isolation, is insufficient to establish, on 
any basis, that these practices occurred.

3.25  Overall, the available evidence does not allow me to conclude to the requisite standard of 
proof that the practice of phone hacking occurred at any specific individual title other than 
the NoTW and, to the extent already discussed, the Mirror titles. There is, however, another 
way of examining this issue, which is to consider the evidence of a more general nature which 
the Inquiry has received to the effect that phone hacking was occurring on a widespread 
basis within the industry, that many knew of it, and that no one did anything to address it. 
The significance of this evidence is that it throws light on the culture, practices and ethics 
of the press at a truly generic level. It does not directly implicate any individual title, but it 
establishes the potentially broad nature of the practice across an indeterminate number of 
unnamed titles, as well as a cultural indifference within the industry to its prevalence. It is this 
evidence which now falls to be analysed.

Industry knowledge of phone hacking and response to phone hacking

3.26  The  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from  a  number  of  journalists  and  editors  which  supports  the 
conclusion that there were at the very least rumours circulating in Fleet Street that phone 
hacking was occurring on a systematic basis, and some evidence from travels considerably 
beyond the limited realm of rumour.

3.27 

It is convenient to commence this section by returning to the evidence of Mr Morgan. In the 
first volume of his published diaries, The Insider, he records under the entry for 26 January 
2001 that he had been told that people might be listening to his mobile phone messages 
because, if the security code was not changed, then anyone could call his number and if he

did not answer, tap in the four digit code and listen to all the voicemail messages. Mr Morgan’s 
diary entry somewhat wryly observed “it makes me wonder how much public figures and 
celebrities  are  aware  of  this  little  trick”.126  Mr  Morgan  was  asked  to  clarify  this  statement 
when he testified to the Inquiry. He said that, as far as he was aware, he had not previously 
known of this ruse,127 but could not recall who had made him aware of it.128

3.28  Mr Morgan was then asked about an interview which he gave to the Press Gazette in 2007, 

in which he said this:129

“As for Clive Goodman, I feel a lot of sympathy for a man who has been the convenient 
fall guy for an investigative practice that everyone knows was going on at almost 
every paper in Fleet Street for years.”

3.29  When asked to clarify that evidence, Mr Morgan’s explanation was as follows:130

‘Well, that was the rumour mill at the time. I mean, it was exploding around Fleet 
Street. I wasn’t there, I hadn’t been there for three years, but everyone you talked to 
said that he was being made a scapegoat, that this was a widely prevalent thing. I 
wasn’t aware that it was widely prevalent in any specific form. I was hearing these 
rumours like everybody else. The reality is that it certainly seems to have been much 
more widespread at one newspaper, and we now know that the Guardian also phone-
hacked, so you had two newspapers. So it’s certainly wider apparently than just Clive 
Goodman, but I’m not going to get into rumour-mongering because that’s not really 
the point of this Inquiry, I don’t think.
Q.  But  were  you  rumour-mongering  when  you  had  the  interview  with  the  Press 
Gazette in 2007 or were you speaking from your own experience?
A.  No, I was just passing on rumours that I’d heard.
Q.  Was this a practice which, if we may add a third newspaper to the mix, was taking 
place within the Daily Mirror before 2004?
A.  I do not believe so, no.
Q.  You don’t believe so, or you’re sure?
A.  I don’t believe so. To the best of my recollection, I do not believe so.’

3.30  This was not, in any sense at all, a convincing answer. Mr Morgan could not even resist a 
further side-swipe at the Guardian (he had earlier referred to that title as the self-appointed 
bishops  of  Fleet  Street),  perhaps  in  an  attempt  to  draw  attention  away  from  the  broader 
ramifications of the question. When linked with other evidence, his reference to ‘the rumour 
mill’  somewhat  downplayed  the  quality  of  the  evidence  incriminating  the  industry  as  a 
whole. And Mr Morgan chose his words very carefully when asked to speak about the Daily 
Mirror. Overall, Mr Morgan’s attempt to push back from his own bullish statement to the 
Press Gazette was utterly unpersuasive.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public3.31  Mr Morgan was also asked about what he had appeared to admit in relation to phone hacking 
during the course of his appearance on Desert Island Discs in June 2009, but he explained 
that he had misheard Kirsty Young’s question.131 But, in an article originally published in April 
2007 in GQ magazine it is clear that Mr Morgan had no difficulty hearing the questions which 
Naomi Campbell started to put to him about phone hacking:132

‘Q.  Ms Campbell asked you: “It is an invasion of privacy though.” And you say:
“It is, yes, but loads of newspaper journalists were doing it. Clive Goodman, the News 
of the World reporter, has been made the scapegoat for a very widespread practice.” 
So you’re making it clear there what your belief was in April 2007; is that correct?
A.  Yeah, and it seems to have been borne out by events.’

3.32  Unsurprisingly, there was little or no material difference between what Mr Morgan told the 
Press Gazette and Ms Campbell in 2007. On this occasion Mr Morgan’s explanation was similar: 
that there were endless rumours that the practice went much further than Mr Goodman. For 
obvious reasons, Mr Morgan conceded that these ‘rumours’ turned out to correct.

3.33  Max Clifford explained in his evidence that it was common rumour in the media that mobile 
telephones  were  being  hacked  from  early  2000  and  that  this  was  a  topic  which  various 
journalists and people working in the industry discussed in his presence.133 In a similar vein, in 
2002, Dominic Mohan, then the showbusiness editor at The Sun, gave a speech to members 
of the press at the Princess Margaret Awards in which (no doubt with a trace of irony) he 
thanked Vodafone’s ‘lack of security’ for the Mirror’s showbusiness exclusives. Mr Mohan 
accepted in evidence that this was a reference to the rumour, if not the fact, that one could 
hack  into  Vodafone’s  mobile  phones  because  their  PIN  system  was  so  easily  penetrable, 
particularly if the default setting had not been changed. He acknowledged that it was well 
known it was possible to hack voicemails fairly readily and stated there had been a number 
of  articles  printed  about  this,  including  in  the  Daily  Mirror  which,  in  1998,  had  published 
a  piece  about  the  lax  security  around  the  Irish  cabinet’s  mobile  phones,  with  part  of  the 
investigation being the hacking into voicemails.134 That said, this Irish example was somewhat 
stale  material  in  the  public  domain.  It  is  likely  that  Mr  Mohan’s  sources  were  both  more 
recent and closer to home.

3.34  When Mr Mohan first testified as to these matters, in particular his speech at the Princess 
Margaret  awards,  it  is  interesting  quite  how  close  his  words  of  explanation  were  to  Mr 
Morgan’s:135

Q.  Wasn’t the true position something along these lines: that there were rumours 
going around in the press, which you well knew about, which were suggesting that 
phone hacking was occurring on a fairly systematic basis in the Mirror’s titles? Is that 
right or not?

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFA.  There were rumours in the industry. There’s always rumours in the industry about 
various methods, but this wasn’t based upon any evidence at all. It was just the Fleet 
Street rumour mill.
Q.  You weren’t concerned about the law of defamation, were you, when you made 
this statement?
A.  I don’t remember that I was, no.

3.35  He also explained that this speech was purely a joke, and a cheap shot at the Daily Mirror, 
which had had a successful year.136 Mr Mohan returned to give further evidence on a range of 
matters towards the end of Module One. On that occasion he was asked to explain the source 
of a series of articles in the Bizarre column of The Sun, because others had suggested that 
material evidence had been procured by phone hacking. Mr Mohan denied this suggestion, 
and there is no evidence to contradict him.137 It was put to him that his joke about Vodafone 
had raised the biggest laugh of the evening, but he claimed that he could not remember one 
way or the other.138 He also denied that he had ‘borrowed’ Mr Morgan’s terminology when 
previously testifying about phone hacking in order to draw attention away from the fact that 
he knew that phone hacking had been taking place at the paper,139 (or it might be added 
elsewhere). In this context it is notable that Duncan Larcombe, the Royal Editor at The Sun, 
commented that he would not be surprised that if there were or had been the technology to 
intercept voicemail, it might have been being abused by some journalists on some papers.140

F

3.36  A number of editors, former editors and in house lawyers acknowledged in their evidence 
that phone hacking may have been occurring but suggested that they were not aware of the 
practice or that it was hidden from them. For example, Mr Wallace explained that when he 
was showbiz editor at the Daily Mirror, he was not aware of phone hacking being conducted 
by journalists on the showbiz team but acknowledged that the practice ‘might well’ have 
taken place and been hidden from him.141 He also acknowledged that the tip off in relation 
to a story on Ms Jonsson, which came from the showbiz team, could have been a result of 
phone hacking.142

3.37  Drawing  these  various  strands  together,  in  my  view  the  evidence  which  the  Inquiry  has 
received, viewed in the round, strongly suggests that phone hacking was a practice which, 
over the period from the late 1990s to the arrest of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire in 2006, 
was occurring within the industry on a more than localised basis. The nature of the evidence 
currently  available  does  not  permit  any  more  robust  conclusion.  Save  for  the  evidence 
relating to the Mirror titles which has already been examined, it is not possible, and indeed 
is unnecessary, to seek to identify particular titles or to quantify the extent of the practice.

3.38  Equally of interest to the Inquiry is the extent to which this practice was generally known 
about. The evidence of individual witnesses has been examined in some detail, and the point 
has already been made that the evidence of Mr Morgan, in particular, has already attracted 
considerable public interest. I have concluded that Mr Morgan was aware of the use of the

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publictechnique of phone hacking in the industry, and that articles were likely to have been published 
on the basis of material obtained by that technique. Here, the Inquiry is referring to the issue 
at a level of some generality; it is unnecessary to be any more specific. Mr Morgan felt able 
to discuss the matter quite freely in his diary and when interviewed about it after the arrest 
of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire. He also felt no compunction about alluding to the matter 
in specific terms when lunching with Mr Paxman in September 2002. For him, the issue must 
have been of current interest and worth talking about in that context. It is not plausible that 
he was making an elaborate joke about things which simply had not occurred: Mr Paxman 
himself felt that Mr Morgan’s tone was bullying,143 which, in any event, somewhat dispels the 
joke hypothesis.

3.39 

3.40 

It is not possible to reach similar critical conclusions about Mr Mohan’s evidence, although 
aspects of it gave cause for concern. It should be emphasised, however, that in arriving at 
its overall conclusion relating to the state of the industry over the period which has been 
identified, I have not simply focused on the evidence of these two individuals: all relevant 
evidence has been weighed and considered. My conclusion is that knowledge that phone 
hacking was taking place existed in parts of the industry over the period from around 2000 to 
2006, and that to speak only of rumours being rife underplays the extent of the understanding 
and knowledge.

It is to my mind both striking and of serious concern that despite that knowledge and the 
rumours circulating through Fleet Street, nothing public was said or done about this issue 
beyond a series of ‘in-jokes’ at award ceremonies and unguarded references in memoires. 
Further, in the aftermath of convictions which definitively established that phone hacking 
had  occurred  within  at  least  one  title,  minimal  steps  were  taken  within  the  industry  to 
identify whether phone hacking had occurred elsewhere or to investigate the extent of these 
practices.

3.41  For example, in 2007, after the convictions of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman, TMG did not 
investigate  whether  or  not  there  had  been  phone  hacking  by  any  of  their  journalists.  Sly 
Bailey, the then Chief Executive of TMG, explained that there “was no evidence” and she 
did not see a need to investigate.144 The extent of her response to the convictions was to call 
a meeting of the editors of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the People, the Group 
managing editor and the then head of editorial to emphasise that she would not tolerate 
unlawful activity.145

3.42  Even as recently as 2011, a Newsnight investigation alleged that phone hacking had occurred 
at the Sunday Mirror, that celebrities’ voicemails had been hacked and that reporters had 
listened to phone messages and taken a note of what was said. Although TMG denied the 
allegations made by Newsnight, it appears that no formal complaint to the BBC was made146 
and Tina Weaver confirmed was that no investigation was carried out by the Sunday Mirror

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFas a result of it.147 Lloyd Embley, who was appointed acting editor of the People in November 
2007, was asked questions of a general nature in relation to phone hacking, and his responses 
resonated with those given by others:148

Q.  In terms of the hacking scandal, as that broke, what was done on your newspaper 
to deal with that as an industry issue?
A.  What was done on it?
Q.  Yes.
A.  In terms of ...?
Q.  Can you tell me whether anything was done?
A.  No. I do not believe any hacking has occurred on my newspaper. I’m certainly not 
aware of any. I’ve never asked anyone to hack a telephone. I’ve never seen anyone 
hack a telephone. I’ve never heard anyone else ask anyone else to hack a telephone.
Q.  That wasn’t quite my question. My question was really directed at whether your 
newspaper did anything to prevent such occurrences.
A.  No, because I was reassured in myself that it wasn’t occurring.

F

3.43  Nicole  Patterson,  head  of  legal  at  Express  Newspapers  stated  that  no  analysis  of  the 
newspaper’s financial records had been undertaken to see whether Mr Mulcaire or any of 
his associated companies had been engaged. The apparent justification of this position was 
that she had not been told the paper had used any entities connected with Mr Mulcaire.149 
Without directly criticising Ms Patterson, her reasoning tends somewhat to circularity: in my 
view, some form of investigation could easily have identified whether journalists had used Mr 
Mulcaire to obtained information. This is not to suggest that phone hacking did take place at 
any of the Northern & Shell titles; the point being made is that inadequate steps were taken 
to establish that it had not.

3.44  After all, by 2007, rumours of phone hacking were well known in the industry. It was also 
clear, from the ICO’s publication of What Price Privacy? and What Price Privacy Now?, that 
large parts of the press had engaged private investigators to trade confidential information 
on an unprecedented scale. In that context, the convictions of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman 
should have prompted newspapers to conduct proper investigations of the working methods 
of their journalists. The refrain repeated by a number of titles to this Inquiry that there was 
no need to launch an investigation because there was no evidence of a problem at their title 
simply does not wash.

3.45  The potential seriousness of rumours, allegations and suspicions of phone hacking are self-
evident. The Goodman and Mulcaire convictions should have sent out clear warning signals 
to  the  industry  that  phone  hacking  was  a  violation  of  the  criminal  law.  Furthermore,  at 
the very least, it was a grossly unethical practice unless in the pursuit of a story that was 
demonstrably in the public interest and of such significance that justified risking the hazards 
of the criminal law. Despite this, the lethargy on the part of the industry to recognise the 
gravity of this conduct, the reticence in conducting thorough investigations in relation to past

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicand present conduct of journalists and the lack of a rather clearer steer from editors than 
has been evidenced, is disappointing and tends to support the view that phone hacking was 
simply not taken seriously by the industry. It is not difficult to imagine what the reaction of 
the press would have been if a similar scandal had been exposed in another industry.

3.46  With the exception of the sterling investigative journalism conducted at the Guardian, most 
other titles were slow to give prominence to the story, that is to say until the Milly Dowler 
story broke in July 2011. James Harding, editor of The Times, in addressing the point that 
The Times had been slow to pick up  on  the phone  hacking story, acknowledged that this 
was potentially due to external pressures, and sought to explain that both NI and the police 
poured cold water on the story at the time.150 Other titles may have been concerned that 
giving publicity to the story might have the undesirable consequence of turning the lens of 
scrutiny in their direction. But July 2011 represented a sea-change in approach; the story was 
now too big to leave alone. As Mr Harding put it, once the Milly Dowler revelations occurred, 
“the way in which we thought about what was happening or what had happened at the News 
of the World fundamentally changed, and that was not just about how widespread it was, but 
about the nature of the journalistic Inquiry there.”151

The victims

3.47  Through all this, it is important not to lose sight of the victims of phone hacking. The reason 
why  it  matters  that  large  parts  of  the  press  failed  to  take  allegations  of  phone  hacking 
seriously is not simply the fact that phone hacking is illegal; it is also because phone hacking 
amounted  to  an  egregious  breach  of  personal  privacy  and  dignity  which  had  seriously 
detrimental consequences on many of its victims. That large parts of the press were so slow 
in acknowledging this fact adds to the sense that there is, within those parts of the press, a 
cultural indifference to individual privacy and dignity.

3.48  The diversity of the targets of phone hacking is striking. Without engaging in a very detailed 
analysis, it is not possible to identify any particular class of person who was more likely to 
be a victim than any other class. Although the targets included a large number of celebrities, 
sports stars and people in positions of responsibility, they also included many other ordinary 
individuals who happened to know a celebrity or sports star, or happened to be employed by 
them. Other victims had no association with anyone in the public eye at all, but were, like the 
Dowlers, in the wrong place at the wrong time.

3.49  The impact of phone hacking on its victims was clear: the experiences of the Dowlers, Ms 
Miller and Ms Field were referred to elsewhere.152 Similar evidence was also given by Ms 
Church,153 who explained she had been shown information that confirmed that her voicemail 
had been hacked when she was aged just 17. Ms Church’s evidence as to the impact of phone

people out of her life to reduce the number of people who could potentially leak information 
and she felt a sense of guilt having accused people when it was subsequently revealed that 
phone hacking was a more likely cause of the information being in the public domain.154

3.50  HJK gave evidence of the serious professional consequences of phone hacking: he/she had 
not  been  aware  of  an  important  professional  message  left  on  his/her  voicemail  as  it  had 
been hacked into, and as a consequence essentially accused a client of lying when the client 
(correctly) claimed to have left a voicemail message for him/her.155 Others, such as journalist 
Joan Smith, gave evidence of the “complete shock” on learning she had been a victim of phone 
hacking, particularly because the hacking had taken place shortly after her then partner’s 
daughter  had  died  in  a  high  profile  skydiving  accident  and  her  belief  was  that  her  phone 
was hacked in relation to that story.156 Her evidence resonated with that of the Rt Hon Tessa 
Jowell MP, who described her reaction on hearing of the multiple interceptions of her phone 
messages as one of shock and stated that “the invasion of [her] privacy was total during that 
period.”157

3.51  Throughout  the  Inquiry,  not  a  single  witness  suggested  that  any  of  the  specific  examples 
of phone hacking by the NoTW was justified in the public interest, and there is not a shred 
of  evidence  to  suggest  it  was.  Instead,  it  appeared  to  be  a  practice  which,  on  the  whole, 
was directed at obtaining information about the private lives of those in the public eye – 
tittle tattle – cheaply. It may well have been cheap for the newspaper titles who utilised the 
technique, but it cost its victims dearly.

Email hacking

3.52  The  Inquiry  has  heard  some  evidence  of  computer  and  email  hacking  at  both  tabloid 
and  broadsheet  publications,  and  undertaken  by  journalists  directly  as  well  as  through 
intermediaries. As with phone hacking, computer and email hacking is a criminal offence158 to 
which there is no public interest defence. For the avoidance of doubt, as with phone hacking 
the Inquiry has seen no evidence to suggest that a public interest defence, even if available, 
could have been successfully raised in any individual case, save to the very limited extent 
expressly referred to below. The scale of these activities is even more difficult to assess than 
phone hacking, in particular because the methods used to obtain the information require a 
greater degree of technological know-how and may well be harder to detect. I am conscious 
of the need not to speculate without sufficient evidence as to whether and, if so, to what 
extent, computer and email hacking has taken place and whether this has been perpetrated 
by  journalists,  or  by  third  parties  engaged  by  journalists  for  this  purpose.  However,  it  is 
important to record the evidence the Inquiry has heard on this issue as an example of conduct 
which may, and I put it no higher than this, have been more widespread than these examples.

3.53 

Ian Hurst, a former member of British military intelligence, told the Inquiry he was informed 
by a BBC journalist working for the Panorama programme that there was evidence that he 
had been targeted by a private investigator engaged by NoTW; that private investigator had

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicthen employed a private detective specialising in applying and controlling computer viruses 
to hack into his computer. He explained he was shown a fax which contained information from 
his emails, and an extract from specific emails copied into the fax which had been sent to the 
NoTW offices in Dublin during the time he was working in Northern Ireland in 2006. In this 
instance, the basis for the email hacking seems unlikely to be related to Mr Hurst’s private life, 
but rather his role in recruiting and running agents in Republican terrorist groups. He further 
explained that hacking into emails was achieved through the use of a Trojan worm inserted 
into the computer hard drive, in this case by way of an email being sent and opened.159 This 
allowed the hacker to see all emails sent and received by Mr Hurst for a three month period.

3.54 

Jane Winter of British Irish Rights Watch was told in July 2011 that email communications and 
documents which had been sent by her to Mr Hurst had been illegally accessed, including 
attachments  to  emails  of  a  confidential  and  sensitive  nature.  The  effect  of  the  hacking 
was described as “chilling” by Ms Winter because unauthorised access to material has the 
potential to compromise official investigations and the safety of individuals.160

3.55 

In Ms Miller’s amended claim against NGN she alleged that in September 2008, her email 
account was hacked into using the same password as her mobile phone password, and that 
private messages were accessed. On 12 May 2011, News International admitted all the causes 
of action pleaded in her civil claim, including the allegation of email hacking.161

3.56  The Inquiry also heard evidence in relation to the alleged hacking of an email account at The 
Times, but for reasons which have already been explained it is inappropriate to explore this 
issue in detail. John Ryley, Head of Sky News, told the Inquiry that during his 12 years as a 
senior executive, he was aware of two cases in which Sky News had authorised a journalist 
to access the email accounts of individuals suspected of criminal activity, on the grounds that 
this decision was justified in the public interest. In one of these cases, the material that was 
discovered by the Sky News journalists was of sufficient importance and relevance to criminal 
investigations that it was handed to the police and used to prosecute an individual.162

3.57  Overall, it is safe to conclude that email hacking has taken place in recent years. However, 
particularly in advance of the conclusion of the investigations by the officers on Operation 
Tuleta, the evidence of email hacking is insufficiently robust to found any conclusions relevant 
to the culture, practices and ethics of the press. In those circumstances, the matter cannot be 
taken any further forward.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

Blagging

3.58  The evidence of a number of witnesses has addressed the use of blagging techniques to obtain 
personal information. The term blagging refers to obtaining information by impersonating 
someone entitled to the information, either in person, by telephone or through other methods 
of communications. Usually, but not always, blagging will constitute an offence under s55 of 
the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). In instances where this provision applies, it should not 
be overlooked that the statute contains a public interest defence. In instances where this 
provision does not apply, and assuming that no other offence such as one under the Bribery 
Act 2010 or its predecessor legislation is in play, no issue of potential criminal liability could 
arise, but ethical considerations obviously would.

3.59  The Inquiry has heard that blagging and impersonation techniques were used by journalists 
directly and by intermediaries engaged by journalists for this purpose. A significant part of 
the narrative relating to the use of blagging techniques is the evidence revealed by Operation 
Motorman163, which is addressed elsewhere in the Report.164 However, it is worth recalling in 
this context that the ICO investigation identified a widespread trade in personal information, 
driven  in  significant  part  by  journalists,  and  uncovered  conclusive  evidence  that  Mr 
Whittamore was regularly engaged personally, or through associates, in the use of blagging 
techniques to acquire information which was then sold to journalists.

3.60 

In  2003  Richard  Thomas,  the  then  Information  Commissioner,  wrote  to  Sir  Christopher 
Meyer, former Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, identifying the problem in the 
following terms:165

“It  is  clear  from  the  very  considerable  volume  of  material  that  our  investigations 
have collected that journalists from most national newspapers and many periodicals 
are  significant  ’customers’  of  the  enquiry  agents  concerned.  We  have  obtained 
extensive and detailed records showing that numerous journalists routinely obtained 
confidential  information  they  should  have  no  access  to.  Such  information  has,  for 
example,  been  obtained  to  produce  articles  on  the  personal  lives  of  “celebrities” 
and others currently or prospectively in the public eye, where there appears to be 
no suggestion of using it to expose wrong-doing We have also obtained extensive 
records which show payments by newspapers for the confidential information which 
has been obtained through these channels. Given the sums involved, and the nature 
of the documentation, it is difficult to believe that senior managers were not aware 
of what was going on, and were therefore at least tacitly condoning it. In short, the 
material which has already been collected by my office indicates widespread reliance 
by  the  press  on  information  which  is  obtained  by  deception  or  by  bribing  corrupt 
employees.”

3.61  The  documents  retrieved  as  part  of  Operation  Motorman  reveal  that  in  many  instances 
information would be obtained by Mr Whittamore, or through his associates, by blagging 
techniques. As has already made clear, the Inquiry accepts the evidence of Mr Thomas that 
any  possible  public  interest  justification  is  likely  to  have  been  non-existent  save  in  a  few 
instances.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public3.62 

In  addition  to  the  evidence  heard  in  relation  to  Operation  Motorman,  the  Inquiry  heard 
evidence  that  a  number  of  journalists  were  themselves  responsible  for  blagging  or 
attempting to blag information for stories.166 The Inquiry also heard that in some instances 
specific information would be blagged through the use of intermediaries, possibly in order 
to facilitate phone hacking which would be conducted by the journalist directly. For example, 
Mr Davies in his evidence explained that Mr Mulcaire would often not listen to voicemail 
messages himself, because this was mostly done by the journalists; but Mr Mulcaire would 
enable  this  to  take  place  because  he,  as  a  “brilliant  blagger”,  would  get  information  and 
data from a mobile phone company and pass this to journalists.167 Alex Owens (the ex-police 
investigator who worked with the Information Commissioner) took a similar view in relation 
to the activities of Mr Whittamore, namely that he was “gathering the numbers – he wasn’t 
hacking, he was definitely not into hacking, we found no evidence of that. But he was then 
passing them to the papers and possibly those numbers were being passed to people who 
hacked.”168

3.63  As with phone hacking, the practice of blagging was not confined to a handful of “rogue” 
reporters, nor was it confined to a particular section of the newspaper market. Journalists 
from across the range of newspaper titles were engaged in using blagging techniques and the 
Inquiry heard evidence that these techniques were known, or at the very least rumoured, 
to be occurring widely within the industry. For example, Mr Davies in his book Flat Earth 
News, published in 2008, made reference to the fact that, by the mid-1990s, Fleet Street 
was employing several dozen different agents to break the law on its behalf, mostly private 
investigators,  and  a  few  were  ordinary  civilians  who  developed  the  knack  of  blagging 
confidential information out of banks and phone companies.169

3.64  Some  examples  of  the  practice  of  blagging  provided  by  Ms  Rowling  and  the  anonymous 
witness HJK were addressed above.170 Further examples were heard from other likely victims 
of the practice. The Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP explained that he believed his bank account 
was accessed by the Observer newspaper in 1999 after a former Observer journalist gave him 
a fairly exact account of the contents of his account, that could only be known to somebody 
who had seen it.171 Alastair Campbell gave evidence to similar effect, namely that he had 
received  calls  from  his  bank  and  telephone  companies  indicating  individuals  had  tried  to 
access his accounts.172

3.65  Bob Crow, General Secretary of the National Union of Rail Maritime and Transport Workers 
(RMT), explained how he believed someone had telephoned the DVLA stating (falsely) that a 
motorbike had broken down and providing the registration mark of the vehicle. That person 
requested from DVLA the name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and these details 
were  provided.  They  were  then  supplied  to  Mr  Whittamore.  Howsoever  this  request  was

on to Associated Newspapers Ltd to produce an article.173

3.66  Although one cannot be sure, it does not appear that there could have been a public interest 
justification for obtaining evidence by these means in any of the examples described. Moreover, 
these were not isolated instances,174 but tend to illustrate the breadth of information being 
sought by the press: from bank accounts details, to addresses and to medical records.

3.67  A further notable example of the practice was provided to the Inquiry by Matt Driscoll, a 
journalist formerly employed by NoTW. He explained that he was investigating a story into 
health problems of a prominent football manager, and his then sports editor had obtained the 
medical records of the individual concerned. Mr Driscoll said that he was told they had been 
obtained through blagging techniques, and that it was possible to obtain this information 
through an investigator sending a fax to a GP or a hospital saying “I’m his specialist, I need 
these  details”;  apparently  many  times  the  information  would  get  sent  straight  back.  Mr 
Driscoll thought it unlikely the sports editor had carried out the blag himself, but noted that 
there were “special people” on the news desk or features desk he went to.175 His evidence 
was further that specialist actors would be employed to obtain private information.176

3.68  Although it was clear that no possible public interest defence could have been run in the 
example provided by Mr Driscoll, it is important to reflect on the extent to which the blagging 
activities that have formed the evidence received by the Inquiry could generally be justified 
as being in the public interest. It is appropriate to commence this analysis with a number of 
examples of blagging which would satisfy the public interest test.

F

3.69  First, Mr Davies recalled that a senior executive at the Guardian was responsible for procuring 
House of Commons notepaper and writing to a hotel in Paris to obtain a copy of Jonathan 
Aitken MP’s hotel bill, this becoming a “famous incident – it’s referred to as the cod fax”. Mr 
Davies accepted that this conduct was blagging but, in this instance, there was clearly a public 
interest justification for it.177

3.70  Second, journalist David Leigh, at the time a reporter with the Observer, told the Inquiry that, 
in order to try to prove a connection between Mark Thatcher, Mr Amunyi, an arms company 
executive, and a defence company. Mr Leigh telephoned Downing Street asking to be put 
through to Mark Thatcher, impersonating Mr Amunyi. He then had a conversation about a 
potential arrangement between Mr Thatcher and the arms company, deceiving Mr Thatcher

into thinking he was Mr Amunyi. Mr Leigh defended his conduct on the basis that it was in 
the public interest as he was investigating impropriety of a public figure, and in this instance 
the defence appears to be well-founded.178

Jon Witherow accepted that journalists at The Sunday Times had used blagging in the past, 
and also impersonation techniques.179 He gave some examples of cases where blagging and 
impersonation  techniques  had  been  used  in  investigations  undertaken  by  the  newspaper 
including: in the 1980s, to establish financial links between the striking National Union of 
Mineworkers  and  Colonel  Gadaffi;  in  the  ‘cash  for  questions’  articles  which  revealed  that 
MPs were prepared to take money for asking Parliamentary Questions, a reporter posed as a 
businessman in order to deceive the MPs; and where a reporter posed as a potential donor to 
investigate the ‘cash for honours’ scandal.180 Further, as part of an investigation into whether 
Labour  peers  were  prepared  to  propose  amendments  to  legislation  in  return  for  cash, 
reporters went undercover as lobbyists to try to obtain an amendment in return for cash. In 
all these cases, which have not been thoroughly investigated by the Inquiry, the potential for 
a public interest justification seems clear. The Inquiry is therefore content to proceed on the 
basis that the practices in these cases were justified as being in the public interest.

3.72  A number of the Core Participants have submitted to the Inquiry that conclusions of a generic 
nature should not be reached about the practice of blagging, for two principal reasons. First, 
it is pointed out that a public interest justification for the practice has been shown to exist in 
a significant number of examples, and might exist in many others. Overall, it is argued that 
the Inquiry cannot assess the evidence, and the applicability of the potential defence, with 
sufficient robustness to make any generic or cultural conclusions. Secondly, it is pointed out 
that the Operation Motorman evidence is now stale, and that the Inquiry should accept the 
evidence of both the current and the former Information Commissioner that the press had 
got its house in order and no longer deployed practices of this sort.

3.73  As for the first of these arguments, the Inquiry is entitled to adopt a commonsense approach. 
In relation to the Operation Motorman material, a consideration of the material obtained by 
Mr Whittamore suggests that, in the vast majority of cases, it would have been extremely 
difficult to mount a public interest defence. This is also no more than Mr Thomas has pointed 
out. In respect of what may be called genuine investigative journalism, and in cases where 
there  was  some  evidence  to  justify  a  line  of  Inquiry  which  could  not  have  been  fruitfully 
pursued  by  other  means,  the  use  of  blagging  could  have  been  justified;  the  Inquiry  has 
provided some instances where such a conclusion would appropriately be reached. In other 
instances,  however,  the  activity  could  better  be  characterised  as  ‘fishing’  rather  than  as 
justifiable in the public interest. And then there is a whole body of cases, indeterminate in 
size and range but clearly more than isolated instances, well outside the envelope of genuine 
investigative journalism, in which the practice of blagging is very likely to have been unlawful 
and almost certainly unethical. The scale of the practice cannot be quantified with precision, 
but all the available evidence demonstrates that it occurred on a sufficiently prevalent basis 
to be ‘cultural’, and worthy of adverse comment.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF3.74  The second argument is more difficult to address for a number of reasons. In the specific context 
of  Operation  Motorman,  I  accept  the  evidence  of  the  current  Information  Commissioner, 
Christopher Graham, that his office has received no recent complaints of breaches of the 
DPA by journalists.181 Although he would have expected to receive complaints had relevant 
victims known of unlawful activity concerning them, it is the nature of the offence under this 
statute that it will typically be ‘silent’; after all, the evidence in Operation Motorman was 
only revealed after the police were conducting a criminal investigation in which they involved 
the Information Commissioner (in the person of Mr Owens) who picked up a thread that led 
to Mr Whittamore. Thus the absence of evidence does not prove a negative (namely that 
the practice has ceased), but it is right to point out that there is no evidence which proves 
that the type of conduct exemplified by the Operation Motorman material has continued in 
recent years.

3.75  Looking at blagging more widely, it is impossible to reach any firm conclusions. Blagging has 
been a practice of some considerable pedigree and extent. It certainly formed part of the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press for many years and was frequently not justified by 
the public interest. Is it plausible that such an ingrained practice has been totally eliminated, 
except where justified by the public interest? The short answer, notwithstanding the paucity 
of recent evidence bearing on any particular title, is no.

F

3.76  This  is  most  assuredly  not  to  condemn  legitimate  investigative  journalism  in  the  public 
interest in which blagging undoubtedly plays its part. This is supported by the evidence of Ian 
Hislop who stated “in terms of blagging, I don’t throw my hands up at blagging. There have 
been some very effective blags.”182 I have no doubt that Mr Hislop is correct and that there 
are many instances that can be identified where blagging techniques had been used to obtain 
information clearly in the public interest and thus both in accordance with the law and ethical 
journalism. But that is not a fair portrayal of the picture.

3.77  Aside from the breadth and currency of the practice, little of which apparently can be seen 
to have any legitimate public interest justification, it is appropriate to consider the manner 
in  which  the  press  as  a  whole  responded  to  the  problem  when  its  prevalence  and  the 
concern about it was incontestable. By way of specific example, Mr Driscoll explained that he 
considered the reaction to blagging in the newsroom was one of mirth.183 Viewing the matter 
at a somewhat higher level of generality, the industry response to the Operation Motorman 
revelations, and its approach to the use of private investigators and enquiry agents generally, 
is itself revealing and is examined below in respect of various titles.

Mail on Sunday

3.78  The  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from  the  then  editor  of  the  Mail  on  Sunday,  Peter  Wright,  in 
relation  to  the  steps  taken  to  investigate  the  use  of  Mr  Whittamore’s  services  following 
his arrest in March 2003 and charge in February 2004. Mr Wright’s evidence was that the 
managing editor had issued an instruction around February 2004 (although not as a direct 
consequence  of  Mr  Whittamore  being  charged)  that  his  services  should  only  be  used  in

had to be satisfied that other means of obtaining information had been exhausted. Save for 
two payments made to Mr Whittamore in early 2005, Mr Wright told the Inquiry that the 
Mail on Sunday stopped using Mr Whittamore in September 2004.

3.79 

It follows from Mr Wright’s evidence that the Mail on Sunday was still using Mr Whittamore, 
albeit  within  certain  parameters,  after  he  had  been  charged  with  offences  relating  to  the 
unlawful acquisition of private information.184 It appears from Mr Wright’s evidence that no 
investigations  were  undertaken  by  the  Mail  on  Sunday  to  identify  which  journalists  were 
using Mr Whittamore’s services, whether or not they had been procuring the commission 
of  offences,  and  whether  there  was  a  public  interest  defence  for  the  activities  and  the 
information being obtained.

3.80  Mr Wright said in his evidence “why would I go and look for something that hadn’t been 
suggested to me? I mean, I could begin from the assumption that every single enquiry that 
we make involves illegal activity of some sort, but I can’t do that”.185 Whilst it may have been 
going too far to assume every enquiry made of Mr Whittamore was unlawful, there was a 
serious risk that in relation to some types of information, for example seeking friends and 
family numbers, or criminal record checks, breaches of s55 of the DPA had occurred. Certainly 
by the time the second report of the Information Commissioner was published in December 
2006, it was clear that the types of inquiries being made, for example criminal record checks, 
were probably unlawful. Mr Wright went on:186

“I  was  aware  by  the  time  “What  price  privacy?”  came  out  that  the  appropriate 
authorities,  i.e.  the  Information  Commissioner  and  the  police,  had  conducted  an 
investigation into this, that in I think two or three cases they had found evidence that 
they thought warranted a prosecution, which resulted in a conditional discharge. I 
didn’t see the need to go over ground that they had gone over themselves, bearing 
in mind also that we didn’t have and weren’t shown the evidence, Whittamore’s log 
books, on which the Information Commissioner based his research.”

3.81  Without criticising Mr Wright, whereas the Information Commissioner and the police had 
investigated Mr Whittamore and a number of his associates, those entities had not investigated 
the activities of any journalists. Had there been any such investigation, the employers of the 
journalists  involved  would  have  been  made  aware.  It  follows  that  an  investigation  by  the 
Mail  on  Sunday  into  the  activities  of  its  journalists  would  not  have  been  going  over  “old 
ground” but would have the potential to uncover new ground. The Mail on Sunday accepted 
the overall findings of the Information Commissioner which included that 33 Mail on Sunday 
journalists had used Mr Whittamore for 266 transactions. In April 2007 the Mail on Sunday 
banned the use of all external search agencies.187

Daily Mail

3.82  Paul Dacre explained in evidence that, whilst he was aware of the use of Mr Whittamore 
from around 2004/2005, he was not aware of the extent to which his services were being 
used by journalists at the Daily Mail. Mr Dacre was asked to explain why he did not initiate an 
investigation at this time into the extent to which Mr Whittamore’s services were being used 
by the Daily Mail’s journalists. He replied:188

‘A.  I don’t think that’s fair because everybody – everybody, every newspaper – and 
I see the BBC spent nearly as much on enquiry agents as we did – was using him. 
We didn’t realise they were illegal. There was a very hazy understanding of how the 
Data Protection Act worked and this was seen as a very quick way of obtaining phone 
numbers and addresses to corroborate stories.

Q.  Regardless of what other bodies might have been doing with search agencies, 
we’re talking about what the Daily Mail was doing with Mr Whittamore, who, after 
all, had had his collar –

A.  Well, I mean – no, but I mean all newspapers were using – virtually all newspapers 
were using Whittamore.

Q.  Are you saying that that would be a reason for the Daily Mail not carrying out a 
proper investigation into the extent of the possible illegality, Mr Dacre?

A.  Well,  it’s  very  difficult  to  say  that.  The  story  of  Operation  Motorman  barely 
registered on the consciousness. I don’t think it made much in the papers. One was 
aware  of  it,  I  suspect,  that  the  man  had  been  given  a  conditional  discharge.  All 
newspapers were still using this agency. I repeat: we thought it was – we believed 
and the journalists believed that it was to get phone numbers quickly. I’m not sure an 
investigation at that stage was warranted.

Q.  Regardless of how quick and efficient this might have been as a means of obtaining 
information, the concern, of course, is that this mode of information-gathering was 
illegal. Didn’t that cause you greater concern, Mr Dacre?

A.  We didn’t believe it was illegal. Our journalists were asking for information and 
I’m not sure that the implications of the Data Protection Act were understood at that 
stage.”

3.83  This was revealing evidence on account of the light it throws on the culture, practices and 
ethics of the press. The argument that most other national newspapers were also using Mr 
Whittamore’s services does not tend to demonstrate the legality of the practice. At best, this 
is a neutral factor which ought not to have engendered any degree of complacency. The fact 
that no other newspaper carried out an investigation into what their journalists knew as to 
Mr Whittamore’s methods, despite their obvious wherewithal to do so, is a solid pointer to 
the ambient culture.

3.84  Although Mr Dacre does not merit being singled out in this regard, his belief that his journalists 
were acting lawfully is something of a concern and certainly ought to have been put into 
question by the Operation Motorman disclosures. Notwithstanding that data protection was 
somewhat  of  a  Cinderella  subject  ten  years  ago,  it  is  somewhat  surprising  that  extensive 
newspaper operations, which clearly were involved in handling data all the time, had not

630

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicensured that they were sufficiently briefed on the implications of the data protection regime 
when the Act was passed; and this is to say nothing of what newspaper titles ought to have 
done to investigate the implications of the Motorman disclosures.

3.85  The second report published by the Information Commissioner placed the Daily Mail at the 
top of league table, with some 958 transactions which were claimed to have been identified 
positively as illegal, involving 58 journalists. In the aftermath of this report, Mr Dacre took 
a numbers of steps to respond to these revelations, including: writing provisions requiring 
compliance with the DPA into the contracts of journalists employed by the Daily Mail; holding 
seminars to give training to journalists on this issue; and contacting all third parties that had 
been used for research and information, including genealogists, tracing and search agencies, 
credit reference and information agencies and Inquiry agents by the Daily Mail, and asking 
each for an assurance in writing that their operations complied with the DPA.189 Further, in 
April 2007 Mr Dacre banned the use of search agents by the Daily Mail. Since that time, four 
named organisations have been approved for use by the newspaper, namely a genealogical 
research  agency,  a  credit  information  company  for  business  information  and  two  tracing 
agencies.190 The Daily Mail’s actions between December 2006 and April 2007 were entirely 
appropriate and responsible.

3.86  Mr Dacre summarised his evidence in the following way:191

“All I am try to tell you is that when I did know the extent of it, I moved decisively and 
ruthlessly to stamp it out. Other newspapers didn’t and we did”.

and

“In 2007 the Daily Mail brought the shutters down and banned absolutely the use of 
the Whittamore enquiry agencies”.

3.87  Mr Dacre’s reference to what other newspapers were not doing will be addressed in due 
course.  In  relation  to  the  Mail  titles,  the  issue  of  whether  the  shutters  have  indeed  been 
wholly brought down has been disputed on behalf of the Core Participant Victims.

3.88  First,  it  is  said  that  the  Whittamore  data  may  still  be  located  in  the  offices  of  Associated 
Newspapers Ltd, because it is common ground  that no positive steps have been taken to 
locate and erase it. That said, given the evidence that such data was not filed electronically but 
jotted down in journalists’ notebooks, this appears unlikely and, in any event, is very difficult 
to investigate. Second, it is pointed out that some of the journalists using Mr Whittamore’s 
services a decade ago are still working for the company in more senior positions. Even so, 
in  fairness  to  Associated  Newspapers  Ltd,  I  accept  that  it  would  have  been  impossible  to 
investigate  or  discipline  employees  so  many  years  after  the  events  in  question.  A  fairer 
criticism of these titles relates to the lack of any investigation at an earlier stage.

Northern and Shell

3.89  Peter Hill, editor of the Daily Express from December 2003 to February 2011, said in evidence 
to the Inquiry that he was not aware of the Information Commissioner’s reports, could not 
recall reading them, nor did he consider they were relevant on the basis that the Daily Express

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFhad never used “anything of that kind”. This does not precisely tally with the Information 
Commissioner’s report which identified that a handful of journalists from the Daily Express 
had sought information from Mr Whittamore on around 20 occasions. Mr Hill accepted that 
the more accurate position was that he had no idea whether private investigators were ever 
used by the Daily Express and there was no evidence to suggest that an investigation had 
taken place.192

3.90  The lack of knowledge of the extent to which private investigators and search agencies had 
been  used  at  the  Daily  Express  resonated  with  evidence  relating  to  the  Daily  Star.  Dawn 
Neesom, current editor of the Daily Star, acknowledged that she had not been aware that 
search agencies had been used until this had been brought to her attention by her legal team, 
and acknowledged that it had surprised her that these methods had been deployed.193 She 
explained that, at the Daily Star, the lineage sheets showing payments made were signed 
off by the deputy editor and these did not come to her attention. It was also apparent from 
Ms Neesom’s evidence that the corporate governance system at the Daily Star essentially 
consisted  of  what  she  described  as  a  financial  system  and  a  staff  handbook;  there  were 
no processes or procedures in place to ensure transparency of conduct and accountability 
for  methods  used  to  obtain  information,  with  the  sums  paid  for  this  purpose.  In  answer 
to a question directed to the adequacy of corporate governance at the paper, Ms Neesom 
conceded:194

‘I think there might be some truth in that. Our system would throw up things financially, 
I think, as Nicole discussed earlier on, and on the lineage sheets those things would 
come up. On the Daily Star, the lineage sheets are always signed by my deputy editor, 
I don’t sign them, and as I said, the figures seemed to be £50, £70 here and there, so 
it’s not something that would come to my notice in that way.

F

3.91  Ms Neesom explained that the current system was under review, in particular a proposal to 

introduce some training for new journalists joining the team.

3.92  Ms Patterson, explained in her evidence that an internal investigation had been commenced 
in July 2011 in relation to phone hacking, blagging and associated activities from 2000.195 
Ms Patterson said that she had asked news editors and other editors and deputy editors for 
names of search agents or private investigators that had been used and these names were 
searched in the accounts.

3.93  Whilst Ms Patterson stated she felt she had done what she could, she acknowledged that the 
internal investigations into the use of search agencies and private investigators had not been 
straightforward. Ms Patterson explained that she had encountered problems in trying to marry 
up the payments made, often in the region of £75 or £90, with particular information, noting 
that whilst the invoices may contain the heading of the article it was not always apparent 
what  information  had  been  the  subject  of  the  request.  She  explained  that  it  was  almost 
impossible to match up the activities of Mr Whittamore’s company with the financial records 
and any particular journalists. She said that where fixed fees appeared regularly, for example 
£75, these appeared to relate to searches for the same type of information. However, where 
fees were higher, sometimes more than £1,000, she understood that this was a different type 
of search, or subject to negotiation.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public3.94  Ms Patterson was not aware if JJ Services (one of Mr Whittamore’s companies) was still being 
used by Northern & Shell at present, although an examination of the records demonstrated 
that it was being engaged as recently as 2010.196 When asked to explain why Northern & Shell 
had still been using the services of Mr Whittamore in recent years, Ms Patterson said:197

‘It’s a matter for the news editor and the editor. It’s not something that is within my 
remit, I’m afraid, and I can’t speak for them.
Q.  No, you can’t. Have you drawn these matters to the attention of the news editor 
and the editor?
A.  Yes.
Q.  And what advice – you don’t have to tell us the advice.
A.  No.
Q.  But I think what you can tell us is whether this is being pursued with Mr Whittamore?
A.  I can’t tell you that.
Q.  Okay. You can’t because you won’t or because –
A.  No, because I don’t know’

This was another revealing answer. It speaks for itself.

3.95  Ms Patterson was not able to assist with the nature of the information that was being obtained 
by the search agencies, and also highlighted that it was in the circumstances difficult to identify 
what sums had been paid for precisely what services: for example, a sum was sometimes 
quoted as a “day rate”, and it remained unclear to what this rate related.198 In my view, these 
investigations could have been pursued with more success if the five search agencies that 
had been used had been contacted with a request to provide a detailed explanation of the 
work completed for Northern & Shell, the methods deployed in each case and sources used 
to attain information. However Ms Patterson explained this had not been done.

3.96  Paul Ashford, group editorial director of the Northern & Shell companies, explained that he 
was not aware of the Information Commissioner’s reports until around 2010.199 He explained 
that he had some concern as to whether any inappropriate action had taken place, but he 
was informed by the legal department that agencies had been used as a means of finding 
out contact information, so it was “fairly low profile stuff” and he was not overly concerned 
about this. The fact that the Daily Express was still using Mr Whittamore as late as 2010 was 
not brought to his attention.

3.97 

In  terms  of  payments,  Mr  Ashford  explained  that  the  invoices  primarily  showed  amounts 
of £75 or £90, but in some cases there were invoices for £1,000. Surprisingly, there was no 
mechanism for determining precisely what the £1,000 was purchasing: for example, whether 
this was the total of the searches conducted on one day, or on a number of days, or simply 
one request. Mr Ashford accepted that the systems were, rightly, being reviewed and it would 
be a good idea to have a system where it was possible to see with enough detail what has 
been purchased.

3.98  Mr  Witherow,  confirmed  that  one  journalist  at  The  Sunday  Times  had  made  use  of  Mr 
Whittamore for four tasks. Certain investigations had been undertaken which revealed that 
one such task was to trace the phone number of a former Home Office official who could not 
be contacted through the Home Office. However, these investigations had not been easy as 
the individual had left the newspaper.200

3.99  Two points ought to be made about this. First, the extent of the problem at The Sunday Times 
had been minor, given that it only related to four cases. Second, this newspaper did more 
than others to carry out an investigation.

3.100  Thomas Mockridge, chief executive officer of NI, explained that the newspapers under his 
wing did not now employ private investigators (whom he defined as individuals who sought 
to obtain information not otherwise in the public domain), save in circumstances where a 
request was made by an editor to Mr Mockridge and consent was given. He explained he had 
not given approval for the use of private investigators to date. In relation to search agents 
(whom he defined as agencies obtaining information from publicly available records), these 
were subject to the general governance of the company and were restricted in the ways they 
operated, being held to the same standards as employees. Mr Mockridge accepted that the 
methods being used by search agencies may require positive control by the newspaper and 
ongoing attention to ensure the methods used were satisfactory.201

F

Trinity Mirror

3.101  Mr  Embley,  who  was  appointed  acting  editor  of  the  People  in  November  2007,  some  12 
months  after  the  publication  of  the  Information  Commissioner’s  second  report,  said  in 
evidence that he was unaware whether any investigations had been carried out as to whether 
or not transactions by People journalists with Mr Whittamore were legal or illegal. Mr Embley 
accepted  that  historically  there  had  been  a  failure  on  the  part  of  the  media  generally  to 
respond to warnings; however, in relation to the People specifically, his evidence was to the 
effect that nothing had been done to react to warnings because he felt that no action was 
required.202

Conclusion

3.102  In reflecting upon what steps have been taken between the publication of the Information 
Commissioner’s  Reports  in  2006  and  the  present,  both  to  investigate  the  use  of  private 
investigators and cash payments and improve governance structures to prevent the continued 
use of unethical practices, it is clear that different newspaper groups have adopted varying 
responses. That said, it is possible to draw at least two conclusions from the evidence heard 
by the Inquiry.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public3.103  First,  a  number  of  newspapers  were  very  slow  off  the  mark  to  respond  to  the  fact  that 
Mr  Whittamore  was  arrested  in  2003,  and  charged  in  2004,  for  offences  relating  to  the 
unlawful acquisition of private information. The majority of newspapers continued to use Mr 
Whittamore and his companies after his arrest, and in those circumstances there must have 
been at least some risk that journalists engaging him might have been receiving information 
which had been unethically, if not unlawfully, obtained. The Inquiry has received no evidence 
that newspapers sought express written assurances from Mr Whittamore explaining his new 
modus operandi and confirming that his operation would now be both ethically and lawfully 
carried out.

3.104  The arrest of Mr Whittamore in 2003 and subsequent charge, compounded by the knowledge 
(in some cases) that his services were being used, merited an investigation by newspapers 
as  to  the  circumstances  in  which  his  services  had  been  commissioned,  the  nature  of  the 
information obtained, the extent to which he continued to be used and the nature of his 
current  methods.  Notwithstanding  that  such  investigations  should  have  been  conducted 
earlier, the Information Commissioner’s second report was another reminder which should 
have set in train detailed investigations into these issues.

3.105  Second, it is clear that, in relation to those newspaper groups that did undertake belated 
investigations into the use of private investigators, difficulties were encountered in trying to 
marry up invoices with the precise information that had been supplied to the journalists, or 
the methods used. These difficulties point to deficiencies in financial systems and corporate 
governance which require to be addressed.

Surveillance

3.106  For many celebrities and people in the public eye, being photographed on a daily basis is 
commonplace. Whilst some of this publicity may be encouraged for the purpose of promoting 
causes or creating positive publicity, other elements of photography is not welcomed. The 
Inquiry has heard evidence from a number of witnesses in relation to photographers being 
a constant presence outside their homes. By way of example Mr Coogan said that over a 
period of ten years photographers had frequently camped outside his house day and night.203 
The Inquiry has also heard of individuals being pursued by the paparazzi. Ms Miller in her 
evidence explained:204

“I would often find myself – I was 21 – at midnight running down a dark street on my 
own with ten big men chasing me and the fact that they had cameras in their hands 
meant that that was legal, but if you take away the cameras, what have you got? 
You’ve got a pack of men chasing a woman and obviously that’s a very intimidating 
situation to be in.”

3.107  For the majority of these individuals the presence of photographers is known and obvious, 
indeed  in  some  cases  oppressively  so.  However,  the  Inquiry  has  also  heard  evidence  that 
covert  surveillance  of  individuals  took  place  by  the  press,  either  directly  by  journalists  or 
indirectly through the use of intermediaries, in particular private investigators. The Inquiry 
heard evidence from a variety of people to the effect they had been placed under surveillance 

203 Mr Coogan had been told by Mr Paul McMullan, then of the News of the World had that he used to sit outside his 
house. pp11-12, lines 9-18, Steve Coogan, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Transcript-

by  newspapers;  these  individuals  included  celebrities  and  their  friends  and  family,205 
politicians,206 but also individuals who were not obviously public figures.

3.108  The evidence relating to the NoTW’s employment of Derek Webb as a private investigator 
has been discussed in detail elsewhere.207 In the period spanning eight years, Mr Webb, a 
former  police  officer,  placed  approximately  150  people  under  surveillance  on  instruction 
from NoTW, including a number of celebrities, MPs, sportsmen and members of the public 
who were connected with famous individuals but were themselves of no particular interest. 
He estimated roughly 85% of his time was spent investigating celebrities and MPs, and most 
of the instructions related to stories on the topic of sexual relationships, affairs and intimate 
relationships. In some instances, celebrities would be subject to surveillance over a period 
of up to two weeks by following them by car or on foot, or ”solely watching them day in, day 
out”. In one case a wife of a footballer was under surveillance for one month. Mr Webb’s 
evidence corresponded with that of Neville Thurlbeck in these respects.208

3.109  Other  examples  of  surveillance  include  that  described  by  Mr  Shear,  a  lawyer  who  was 
followed by journalists and photographers when attending to a client at a secret meeting 
place.209 Similar evidence was given by Jacqueline Hames who together, with her husband 
David Cook, was a serving police officer placed under surveillance by NI. This surveillance 
took the form of persons working in two vans, and on one occasion a van followed Mr Cook 
with his son and daughter to school. The NoTW’s alleged justification for this surveillance 
was  that  it  was  suspected  they  were  having  an  affair  together,  a  position  that  lacked  any 
credibility given that Ms Hames and Mr Cook had been married for some years and had two 
children. Ms Hames has suggested other motives for the surveillance,210 but the Inquiry was 
unable, in the time available, to come to any firm conclusion on those alternative motives. 
In any case, the impact on Ms Hames was significant: it provoked considerable anxiety, had 
significant consequences for her private life and her distress was evident in the course of her 
evidence to the Inquiry.211

3.110  The damage that can be occasioned by covert surveillance, particularly where surveillance 
cuts across police investigations, was also highlighted to the Inquiry. David Harrison was an 
intelligence officer working for the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) investigating the

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicmurder of five young women in Ipswich. SOCA was assisting Suffolk police with surveillance of 
potential suspects. Mr Harrison was informed that NoTW had deployed a surveillance team to 
identify the SOCA officers and, on at least two occasions during the course of his surveillance 
work, observed vehicles undertaking surveillance of the SOCA team. Mr Harrison conveyed his 
concerns that the activities of NoTW could have jeopardised the police investigation because 
the efforts of the SOCA team in trying to avoid being subject to surveillance themselves by 
the newspaper distracted them from trailing a suspect and further weakened their ability to 
look for evidence.212

3.111  Mr Harrison made other claims about a surveillance team from the Sunday Mirror who were 
seeking to pick up the suspect and take him to a place where he could be debriefed. However, 
the evidence in relation to such a team was unclear, and the Inquiry is satisfied on the basis 
of submissions made by counsel for Trinity Mirror that it did not exist.213

3.112  Inevitably in relation to an issue of this sort, the Inquiry may have received a somewhat one-
sided impression. It is quite possible that surveillance has on occasion been justified in the 
public interest, both in terms of the decision to deploy the technique and the resultant story. 
That said, the Inquiry received little evidence from newspapers containing concrete examples 
of what might be described as ‘good practice’ in this regard. What is more likely is that the 
use  of  surveillance  in  individual  cases  has  often  led  to  newspapers  deciding  not  to  print 
stories, either because such surveillance specifically contradicted the story that was being 
planned, or because it failed to prove the matter one way or the other. The evidence from the 
photographer Matt Sprake was very much along these lines. One might think that the ethical 
issues which arise are likely to be more nuanced in these circumstances: the absence of a story 
means, by definition, that nothing has been placed in the public domain, but questions still 
fall to be asked about the basis for the decision to use an intrusive technique in circumstances 
where the ultimate goal may, in many cases, only be a story devoid of a public interest.

3.113  Mr Sprake’s evidence was alarming in two respects. First, he provided a ‘worklog’, evidencing 
the fact that he had been commissioned by a number of titles (but predominantly by the 
People) to carry out covert surveillance and/or photography on over 300 different subjects 
between July 2010 and June 2012.214 Consistent with Mr Webb’s worklog, the majority of 
the jobs appeared to relate to celebrity gossip and therefore the subterfuge was unlikely to 
have been justified in the public interest. Second, his oral evidence was of particular concern 
insomuch as he appeared not to recognise that he had ethical judgments to make in carrying 
out his tasks. When asked about the ethics of one particular example of covert photography, 
he  said:  “I  think  it’s  an  answer  for  the  newspaper,  really,  rather  than  us.  We’re  tasked  to 
provide the evidence.”215

a newspaper picked up a suspect and took them to a hotel and interviewed him whilst they were under police 
surveillance. Chief Constable Ash of the Suffolk Police explained in his evidence he was unable to find any information 
to support the face that News of the World were deploying surveillance teams against police surveillance teams who 
were following suspect, but there was no evidence to contradict this account. pp31-32, lines 15-4, Simon Ash, http://

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF3.114  In  relation  to  the  evidence  which  the  Inquiry  has  specifically  considered,  it  does  appear 
that, in respect of the vast majority of the instances in which surveillance has been used, 
inadequate consideration has been given to whether such surveillance is itself justified in 
the public interest, let alone whether it is likely to produce any relevant information which 
goes to a story which is being contemplated. Some of the surveillance appears to have been 
commenced on a purely speculative basis in the hope that some fragments of interesting 
material might be obtained if a person is trailed for long enough, and in the many examples 
the Inquiry saw of surveillance commissioned with a particular purpose in mind, there was in 
any event no public interest justification for the surveillance in the first place.

Theft and misappropriation of property consisting of or 
containing private information

3.115  Another  method  at  one  stage  used  by  the  press  to  obtain  private  information  was 

misappropriation and theft of property.

3.116  One practice which appears to have been used frequently was the searching of refuse outside 
the homes of persons of interests to newspapers, or “binnology” as it has become known. In 
particular, the Inquiry heard that newspapers engaged the services of Benjamin Pell (known 
as Benjy the Binman) to search for documents and other information in rubbish bins outside 
the homes and offices of celebrities, and the offices of their accountants and lawyers.216

F

3.117  Mr McMullan told the Inquiry “I think most journalists, me included, would find the contents 
of people’s bins incredibly interesting .... it gives you such a great starting point, much better, 
actually, than hacking a phone because that almost tips them off that you’re looking...”217 
In an article written in 2006 “Scandal on Tap”, Mr Leigh explained that he “did not turn up 
[his] nose when the notorious Benjy the binman emptied a bag of stinking rubbish onto [his] 
carpet.  He  wanted  to  show  [him]  incriminating  statements  about  Saudi  arms  deals  which 
a City law firm had been too idle to shred before putting out on the street for collection.”218 
However, Mr Leigh also made it clear that he also had a look at other rubbish which might 
also have contained material relevant to a public interest story.

3.118  Mr  Morgan  explained  that  he  had  engaged  the  services  of  Benjy  the  Binman  on  several 
occasions, including one where he was presented with sacks which were full of documents 
relating to Elton John; this included bank statements and had been obtained from the bins of 
Mr John’s manager. Mr Morgan considered that this conduct was not illegal and was on the 
cusp of being unethical.219

3.119  The rummaging through bins was practised both in relation to celebrities but also offices of 
newspapers and magazines. Mr Hislop, for example, explained that the bins outside Private 
Eye had been searched and that, in due course, an article which probably derived from that 
rubbish  appeared  in  one  magazine.220  Mr  Campbell  told  the  Inquiry  that  he  would  wake

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicup in the night with people going through his bins and Mr Coogan had experienced similar 
instances with people going through his bins early in the morning.221 The searching of bins 
has  also  proven  to  be  a  mobile  operation,  and  one  that  is  not  defunct.  In  June  2011,  an 
individual journalist who stated that he was working as a freelancer for The Sunday Times 
was  found  going  through  the  bins  at  the  venue  holding  the  AGM  for  the  RMT  hoping  to 
acquire information.222

3.120  The  misappropriation  of  property  is  not  confined  to  extracting  documents  out  of  bins, 
but includes the theft of photographs and physical items, such as diaries.223 Mr McMullan 
explained that he had been involved in the blagging his way into a property in France, stealing 
a photograph off the mantelpiece, copying it and printing it in the NoTW.224 The basis for 
this misappropriation appears to be that it had not been possible to find a photograph in 
the public domain of the relevant individual. This conduct appears to be a gross invasion of 
privacy; whether it was a breach of the criminal law has not been investigated. Further, Tom 
Rowland in his evidence explained that many photographs continued to be stolen today, albeit 
electronically, where watermarks and copyrights were sliced off the bottom of photographs 
and used by newspapers.225

3.121  That said, it is critically necessary to retain a sense of proportion, and consider the extent to 
which these types of practices still represent part of the culture, practices and ethics of the 
press. Whereas ‘binnology’ and kindred practices did form part of the culture in the past, it 
is correct to say that there is insufficient evidence that it still occurs to any significant extent 
and, equally, insufficient material from which that inference might be drawn.

Bribery and corruption

3.122  The evidence relating to the practice of inducing or seeking to induce public or corporate 
officials  to  disclose  confidential  information  in  return  for  payment  is  considered  in  detail 
elsewhere in this report in the context of Operation Elveden.226 Given the present state of the 
criminal investigation, it is not possible to reach any conclusions of a generic nature, although 
the extent of the criminal investigation and the large number of arrests made is undeniably a 
cause for concern. Further, it is worth noting briefly in this context that a number of journalists

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFindicated to the Inquiry that they had previously paid officials for information,227 although in 
each instance reliance would no doubt have been placed on the public interest.

3.123  Given the inevitable paucity of the information available which relates to each of these cases, 
and notwithstanding that neither the Bribery Act 2010, its predecessor legislation, nor aiding 
and abetting misconduct in public office contain a public interest defence, I make no comment 
on this evidence; I merely note that it was given. The Inquiry heard evidence of a somewhat 
historical  nature  that,  at  some  newspapers,  it  was  expected  that  crime  reporters  would 
pay sums of money to police officers in exchange for information. The evidential picture is 
incomplete but, again, the current state of the evidence does not enable any conclusions of 
a generic nature to be reached.

Conclusion

3.124  I  have  concluded  that  the  evidence  seen  and  heard  by  the  Inquiry  is  inconclusive,  or 
insufficient,  to  find  that  bribery  and  corruption,  blagging,  theft  and/or  email  hacking  are 
cultural problems within the press today but there is sufficient arising out of what has been 
said and the present criminal investigation to merit concern. Further, the evidence of these 
practices, limited though it is, does support a wider conclusion that there is a cultural problem 
within  parts  of  the  press  with  regard  to  the  use  of  unethical  methods  to  acquire  private 
information.

F

3.125  The slow and often inadequate response by large parts of the press to the widely known 
practice of phone hacking, considered alongside the inadequate response to the Operation 
Motorman revelations, indicates an industry which, in general, did not find it noteworthy or 
particularly problematic that parts of the press were regularly breaching individual privacy, 
not to mention the criminal law. In addition, the fact that large parts of the press continue to 
employ private investigators to carry out covert surveillance without any clear public interest 
supports the conclusion that, notwithstanding the evidence that phone hacking is likely to 
have ceased as a method employed by journalists, the press retains a casual (or less than 
robust) attitude to the use of unethical methods of acquiring private information.

4.	 Breach	of	confidence	and	misuse	of	confidential	and/

4.1 

or	sensitive	information
In addition to the evidence demonstrating that the press has accessed private information 
from individuals either unlawfully or unethically, the Inquiry heard significant evidence of 
misuse of that private information. That misuse has taken place in two ways: first, through 
the  unlawful  trade  in  confidential  and/or  private  information,  and  second,  through  the 
unjustified publication of that information.

4.2 

As discussed above, Operation Motorman revealed an extensive trade in confidential data. 
Although there is evidence to suggest that that trade has significantly diminished, there are 
reasons to believe that at least a limited trade continues.

Notably,  during  the  course  of  the  Inquiry,  the  Guardian  reported  on  the  illegal  trade  of 
passenger flight information from an employee at Virgin Atlantic to the picture agency Big 
Pictures.228  The  article  revealed  that  over  the  course  of  some  considerable  time  (which 
subsequently turned out to be a period of approximately two years),229 an employee within 
Virgin  Atlantic  had  regularly  disclosed  to  someone  within  Big  Pictures  the  personal  flight 
information of over 60 different celebrities. The strong inference was that Big Pictures used 
that  information  as  an  advantage  over  competitors  when  arranging  for  photographers  to 
pursue celebrities on holidays and other trips abroad.

Jillian  Anne  Brady,  on  behalf  of  Virgin  Atlantic,  told  the  Inquiry  that  Virgin’s  internal 
investigation had confirmed the flow of confidential information from Virgin to Big Pictures; 
she also confirmed that the employee in question had left her employment and that Virgin 
had reported to the ICO what had happened in its own operations.230 It must be said that the 
response by Virgin Atlantic to the revelation was exemplary, and there seems to have been 
very little more that the company could have done to prevent the disclosure. By contrast, the 
same cannot be said of Big Pictures: for “legal reasons” they declined to provide the Inquiry 
with any further evidence of what had taken place.231

The  disclosure  of  personal  flight  information  from  an  airline  to  a  picture  agency  is  both 
unethical and unlawful and is consistent with the practices identified in Operation Motorman. 
Notwithstanding the evidence from editors which suggested that the trade in private and 
confidential  information  had  declined  substantially  since  Operation  Motorman,  what 
happened between the Virgin and Big Pictures gives cause for concern and the fact must be 
that there is a market for pictures taken as a result. I doubt that it is the only recent example 
of  a  trade  in  confidential  information  in  which  the  press  has  an  interest,  and  there  is  an 
undoubted risk that a picture agency (or the paparazzi) will be used, whether knowingly or 
not, as surrogates for the press.

Thus, it will not be a journalist who obtains the information that provides the intelligence to 
lead a photographer to a picture but it will be the photographer who does so, then selling the 
picture to the press with exactly the same outcome. Although the evidence received by the 
Inquiry did not establish that the press remain complicit in a trade in private and confidential 
information, the picture appears to be complex. The evidence did suggest that third parties 
remain involved in the trade of confidential information, and then sell products based on that 
trade to the press. Ultimately, the press do remain responsible for the content it publishes 
and therefore must remain on guard to ensure that information or photographs provided by 
third parties were obtained ethically.

Although there was no clear evidence that the press remain directly involved in the trade in 
confidential information, there was ample evidence to suggest that large parts of the press 
were willing to publish confidential, private or sensitive information, without regard to the 
impact on the individuals concerned and without consideration of the public interest. The 
NoTW’s publication of Dr McCann’s diaries is a prime example of this,232 as is the publication 
of photographs, and the personal blog, of Sebastian Bowles after his death.233

The  Inquiry  heard  many  other  examples  of  the  publication  of  confidential  material.  Mr 
Clifford  gave  evidence  of  the  publication,  without  consent,  of  private  photographs  of 
Rebecca Leighton, the nurse falsely accused of poisoning patients at Stepping Hill Hospital. 
Photographs of Ms Leighton in fancy dress were allegedly taken from her Facebook account 
and used in articles to suggest her guilt.234 Similarly, Ms Mills told of how confidential details 
of her divorce settlement appeared in the national press.235 And Ms Rowling gave evidence 
of the publication of excerpts of a stolen advance copy of one of her novels.236 None of these 
examples of the publication of obviously private, confidential, or copyrighted material was 
justified in the public interest.

Further evidence of a willingness within the press to publish confidential or private information 
came from the examples of newspapers revealing pregnancies, or rumours of pregnancies, 
prior to the 12 week period prescribed by the Editors’ Code. The first pregnancies of both Ms 
Diamond and Ms Church were revealed by the tabloid press before they had even informed 
their families.237 Ms Witchalls’ pregnancy (of only five weeks gestation) was revealed while 
she was unconscious and before she or anyone other than her medical team and immediate 
family knew about it.238 That kind of disclosure in the national press is not only a breach of the 
Editors’ Code but displays a complete disregard for individual privacy, and a lack of respect for 
inherently private and sensitive information.

4.10  A similar type of disclosure which caused significant distress for a number of witnesses was 
the disclosure by newspapers of a person’s address, or of sufficient information to allow a 
reader to identify the person’s address. While an address is not necessarily confidential, it is 
ordinarily private and is certainly sensitive. For a number of witnesses, the disclosure of their 
addresses in the national press occurred with no reasonable justification and gave rise to very 
real concerns for personal safety. Ms Church’s address was disclosed at a time when she was 
the subject of death threats.239 Ms Rowling’s address was revealed along with the details of 
her the security features which she had deployed.240 Ms Diamond’s address was published, 
along with a complete layout and description of her home. As Ms Diamond wrote: “it was a 
complete burglar’s charter”.241 Chris Bryant MP also had his address published in a national 
newspaper. In his witness statement, which described the publication of a story revealing his 
appearance on a gay dating website, he wrote:242

“As the Mail on Sunday had also published my address, I also acquired a stalker who 
followed me home from the tube and sent me a series of lurid letters. On one occasion 
he called my landline (which was ex directory) at two in the morning and told me he

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public4.11  What is clear from all of these examples – the publication of confidential material without 
consent, the revelation of pregnancies before individuals had told friends and families, and 
the publication of individuals’ home addresses – is that the publication of stories which on 
any reasonable analysis may fairly be described as inconsequential can cause very real harm 
to the individuals concerned.

4.12  Perhaps the most egregious instances of the disclosure of confidential information were the 
four examples heard by the Inquiry of a willingness of the press to disclose private medical 
information.  This  type  of  information  is  deserving  of  the  highest  protection.  The  story 
surrounding the revelation of the condition of the Rt Hon Gordon Brown’s son is discussed 
in detail above.243 Second, Mr Grant referred to two episodes in which his private medical 
information  was  published.  In  1996,  the  Daily  Mirror  reported  his  visit  to  see  a  specialist 
at Charing Cross hospital and included within the story his diagnosis and treatment. More 
recently, in March 2011, his visit to the A&E department at Chelsea and Westminster hospital 
was reported in The Sun and the Daily Express.244 Included in those articles was his exact 
complaint;  Mr  Grant’s  view  was  that  the  information  must  have  come  straight  from  his 
medical  records  and,  in  all  likelihood,  from  a  paid  source  within  the  hospital.245  Although 
there was insufficient information to conclude for certain how the information was obtained, 
for the purposes of the Inquiry, it does not matter. The simple fact is that private medical 
information was published without consent and without regard to the public interest (or, at 
least, any reasonable formulation of the public interest).

4.13  Third, and as already referenced in the previous section of the Report, former NoTW journalist 
Mr Driscoll gave evidence of how the paper blagged the medical records of a Premiership 
football manager and used that information to bargain with the manager for cooperation on 
future stories. Notwithstanding the fact that the medical records were likely to have been 
obtained  unlawfully  and  their  disclosure  was  likely  to  have  been  an  actionable  tort,  the 
newspaper successfully persuaded the manager that, in return for the newspaper keeping 
the medical records private, he would cooperate with the newspaper by providing stories in 
future.

4.14  The final example of a willingness within parts of the press to obtain and disclose private 
medical information was the evidence provided by the filmmaker Chris Atkins, in relation to 
the ‘medical records sting’ in his film ‘Starsuckers’.246 Mr Atkins had posed as the boyfriend of 
a woman who worked in a cosmetic surgery in Harley Street. He called a number of tabloid 
newspapers to say that he might be willing to sell information about the procedures carried 
out  to  various  celebrities.  A  journalist  from  the  Daily  Express  immediately  dismissed  the 
proposal a contrary to the Editors’ Code and ended the conversation. Journalists from the 
People, the NoTW and the Daily Mirror arranged a meeting to discuss.

4.15  The transcripts of the conversations which took place at those meetings are extensive and 
revealing.247 During the course of the meeting with a journalist from the People, the journalist 
expressed  some  concern  about  the  publication  of  medical  information,  but  proposed  a

number of ways in which the newspaper might make use of the material without necessarily 
revealing  the  source  and,  in  so  doing,  raising  concerns  around  privacy  and  protection  of 
medical data.248 It was suggested that the material offered by him, which purported to prove 
that  a  member  of  the  pop  group  Girls  Aloud  had  undergone  breast  enlargement  surgery, 
could be used as part of “silhouette spread” or a “have they, haven’t they story”.249

4.16  Mr  Atkin’s  meeting  with  the  Daily  Mirror’s  Nick  Owens  was  equally  illuminating  and 
revealed a distinct lack of respect for the dignity of individuals whose medical information 
was  purportedly  for  sale.  During  their  meeting,  Mr  Owens  asked  Mr  Atkins  to  provide  as 
much information as possible on the cosmetic procedures carried out to named celebrities. 
Although he told Mr Atkins that the publication of medical information was problematic for 
the newspaper because of the Editors’ Code restrictions, he said that such publication could 
be justified if the stories were in the public interest. However, the transcript of the meeting 
revealed his deeply flawed understanding of the public interest. He said, for instance that 
“there probably isn’t a public interest in… just reporting that someone had a gastric band 
operation, unless they are a massively big name then you might make a decision.”250 Similarly, 
when discussing various fictional procedures of which Mr Atkins offered to provide further 
information, Mr Owens thought that “we could get away with” a story of an actress having 
had a gastric band procedure because, he said, “that’s massive, good story that… because as 
you see she does not need it”.251 Similarly, in relation to a story about an actor having a tummy 
tuck, he also thought the paper could “get away with [it] because it’s so funny”.252

4.17  The  claim  that  the  revelation  of  private  medical  information  about  a  celebrity  could  be 
justified in the public interest because the celebrity is particularly famous, or because the 
story is funny or because the celebrity does not, in the journalist’s opinion, need a procedure, 
is  frankly  ludicrous.  A  sympathetic  interpretation  of  Mr  Owens’  comments  is  that  he  was 
merely ‘thinking aloud’ and had given the issue very little thought. But that, perhaps, is the 
problem. What is clear from the transcript is that Mr Owens, an award winning and senior 
journalist with considerable experience,253 was engaged in a conversation directed at eliciting 
from Mr Atkins as much confidential medical information as possible to see whether the Daily 
Mirror might be able to use it in some way. What is also clear is that he had decided to engage 
in that conversation without considering the very many ethical questions that ought to have 
been contemplated in advance.

4.18  Mr Owens sought to avoid that necessary inference from the transcript of the conversation. He 
appeared to claim that he had arranged the meeting with Mr Atkins with a view to potentially 
exposing him as an individual willing to sell medical records.254 However, that explanation is 
simply not credible. As Mr Barr noted in questioning, prior to the meeting Mr Owens had not 
discussed it with his news desk; neither had he, in any way, recorded any intention to carry 
out a sting on Mr Atkins.255 Further, although he had ample evidence that he was dealing with 
an individual who was willing to sell medical records, it is not suggested that he wrote up

I find it very difficult to conceive that he would have done none of these things had he been 
genuinely intent on exposing Mr Atkins.

4.19  The transcript of the meeting between Mr Atkins and Mr Owens reveals a journalist intent on 
receiving information which was plainly confidential and obviously private. It may well be the 
case that Mr Owens had not formed any firm view about whether it would be appropriate 
to  purchase  or  publish  the  information;  and  it  appears  that  after  the  meeting  Mr  Owens 
did not pursue Mr Atkins with any vigour. But that is not the point. An offer to sell private 
medical information about celebrities should have been rejected outright: the Daily Express 
got it right, while Sarah Jellema formerly of the People, and Mr Owens got it wrong. Absent 
an intention to expose, by meeting with Mr Atkins and by encouraging him to access and 
provide medical records to substantiate his claims, Mr Owens acted in a way which showed 
no respect for the confidentiality of medical records and inherent privacy of the individuals 
in question.

4.20  The evidence when considered as a whole suggests that there is a cultural willingness in parts 
of the press to receive and publish confidential and private information. The evidence also 
suggests that those same parts of the press have done so without consideration of the public 
interest, or with a conception of the public interest that is fundamentally flawed.

5.  harassment
5.1 

One  of  the  recurring  complaints  advanced  by  the  Core  Participant  Victims  was  that  the 
attention they received from the press and paparazzi amounted, at times, to harassment. 
Ms Miller gave the most striking description of her harassment as she recalled frequently 
running down dark streets on her own pursued by ten or more men with cameras. Her evidence 
is dealt with in more detail above.256 Similarly, the evidence of Ms Church,257 Ms Rowling,258 
and Mr Coogan259 contained further examples of persistent, intrusive and distressing levels 
of  attention  by  press  and  paparazzi.  Furthermore,  the  evidence  of  the  McCanns,260  the 
Dowlers261 and Baroness Hollins262 illustrated that complaints of harassment were not limited 
to so-called celebrities, but were shared by those with no public persona who, for a variety of 
reasons, were thrust into the public eye.

5.2  Mr Grant described a series of events in the months before and after the birth of his daughter 
which  ultimately  led  to  a  High  Court  injunction  to  prevent  what  amounted  to  egregious 
harassment.263 Throughout her pregnancy, Ms Hong, now the mother of Mr Grant’s child, was 
regularly followed by foot and by car and photographed without her consent. At one stage 
during her pregnancy, when Mr Grant appeared on television discussing the phone hacking 
scandal, Ms Hong was apparently called on her mobile and told to “Tell Hugh Grant to shut 
the fuck up”.264

5.3 

5.4 

After  the  birth  of  her  child,  Ms  Hong  received  numerous  phone  calls,  text  messages  and 
answer-phone  messages  from  journalists.265  Despite  requests  for  them  to  leave,  up  to 
ten  photographers  and  journalists  remained  camped  outside  her  house,  day  and  night.266 
The  photographers  spoke  with  neighbours  and  sought  to  persuade  them  to  call  Ms  Hong 
for  information  about  her  baby.267  When  Ms  Hong  left  the  house,  she  was  pursued  by 
photographers.  On  one  occasion,  on  10  November  2011,  Ms  Hong  called  her  mother  for 
assistance to prevent the pursuit of photographers. Her mother attempted to take photographs 
of one of them but, in response, he sped his car towards her in a menacing manner, forcing 
her to jump out of the way.268

The harassment experienced by Ms Hong and her family appeared motivated by one thing 
only: the pursuit of a photograph of, or statement about, Mr Grant’s new baby. But the impact 
on Ms Hong and her family was significant. She told the High Court that she was seriously 
intimidated and distressed by the experience. She had been unable to look after her daughter 
in a normal way, had had to cancel appointments and was frightened to drive with her child 
for fear that pursuit by paparazzi would make it unsafe to do so.269 She was under virtual 
house arrest. Whatever one thinks of the justification for publishing information about the 
private lives of so-called celebrities, there can be no justification for harassing a new mother 
and her child in this way.

5.5  Ms Gascoigne provided evidence of similar levels of harassment. As the ex-wife of footballer 
Paul Gascoigne, she accepted that, by contracting for coverage of her wedding, appearing 
on shows such as “I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!”, and by selling a book about her 
private life, she could only have a limited expectation of privacy. As a consequence she did 
not complain about the publication of details of her private life,270 but she did complain of 
the harassment that she had endured by journalists and photographers. She recalled that in 
the 1990s, when she was in a relationship with Mr Gascoigne, she was pursued relentlessly 
by photographers who would often drive dangerously to follow her. In order to end these 
pursuits, she would drive around roundabouts multiple times or drive into housing estates; 
on one occasion, concerned for the safety of her children, she was forced to drive to a police 
station  to  end  the  harassment.  In  1996,  when  the  curtains  in  her  home  would  not  close 
properly,  she  was  forced  to  crawl  on  her  hands  and  knees  to  prevent  photographs  being 
taken through the windows by multiple photographers camped outside.271

5.6 

Although Ms Gascoigne noted that things improved slightly in the aftermath of the death of 
Princess Diana,272 the evidence provided to the Inquiry by others suggests that any improvement 
may have been limited. Mr Thomson gave evidence of his experience representing clients

by paparazzi were still very common. One of his clients, Lily Allen, had recently been involved 
in an accident where a photographer had driven through a red light and smashed into her car. 
As she emerged from the car, instead of apologising, the photographer took photographs of 
the singer in distress.273

5.7 

Darryn Lyons of Big Pictures photo agency confirmed stories from his book ‘Mr Paparazzi’. He 
recalled using photos of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, taken during a scooter chase in Paris.274 
He also wrote of the widely used technique for getting car shots:275

“You then run at the car crash, bang, wallop with a wide angle lens. Rosie and I used 
to run up to people driving home past the Portland and practice on them. Must have 
scared the living crap out of them. Funnily enough, just recently I took a call from 
the police who were making a complaint about a couple of my big guys. They were 
outside TV personality Ulrika Jonsson’s house and had been practising their car shots 
on a family and almost caused a major accident.”

5.8  Ms Mills gave evidence that she had been the subject of many car chases and ‘stalkings’ by the 
paparazzi.276 She had been advised by police to keep a video diary of paparazzi intrusion and 
she submitted that video to the Inquiry.277 Although the video is edited and it is sometimes 
difficult to be sure what is happening, it certainly appears to show evidence of photographers 
stalking, pursuing and chasing Ms Mills in a variety of situations, some of which are obviously 
private,  and  some  of  which  appear  to  show  photographers  driving  dangerously.  Ms  Mills 
complained of journalists sitting outside her home with scanning equipment, paparazzi hiding 
and jumping out at her daughter and her without notice, and chasing her in her car. The 
impact of such harassment on Ms Mills and her daughter was clear: she found the behaviour 
intrusive and abusive.278

5.9 

The  Inquiry  heard  further  evidence  of  harassment  from  other  witnesses.  The  Daily  Mail’s 
picture editor Paul Silva noted the daily harassment suffered by the sister of the Duchess 
of Cambridge, Pippa Middleton. He said: “there are nine or ten agencies outside her door 
every day. She goes to get a coffee or she goes back into her house, you get about 3 to 400 
pictures on that day.”279 The recent publication of images of Prince Harry and the Duchess of 
Cambridge280 (the latter, insofar as the print media is concerned, solely in foreign jurisdictions) 
illustrates the continuing intrusion into the private lives of young royals.

5.10  The phenomenon  of press and  paparazzi harassment is  not  new: Ms Diamond’s evidence 
of the behaviour of journalists and photographers in the aftermath of her son’s death was 
an example heard by the Inquiry of seriously harassing behaviour from the early 1990s.281

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFHowever, technological developments in the last 20 years have limited the space in which 
subjects of stories are “safe” from intrusion. The evidence showing a corrupt flow of private 
flight  information  from  Virgin  Airways  to  the  picture  agency  Big  Pictures282  illustrates  the 
difficulties  experienced  by  public  figures  in  seeking  to  escape  the  attentions  of  the  press 
and  photographers,  even  while  abroad.  Moreover,  the  growth  of  ‘citizen  journalists’  and 
the  development  of  websites,  and  newspapers,  encouraging  amateur  photographers  to 
upload and sell their own celebrity pictures283 means that anyone armed with a keyboard 
or a camera can now be part of the wider press and paparazzi and can contribute to the 
harassment experienced by those in the public eye.284 The picture editor of the People noted 
that “nowadays, nearly everyone has a camera with them at all times contained within their 
mobile phone, so often we will get photos sent in this way by members of the public.”285

5.11  Neil Turner of the British Press Photographers’ Association said that the industry faced a real 

problem from “amateur celebrity chasing paparazzi, or ‘stalkerazzi’”. He said:286

“they do involve chasing people down the road, driving dangerously/illegally. They 
do  involve  initiating  a  reaction  and  a  response  from  people  to  get  different  facial 
expressions,  you  know,  in  a  kind  of  completely  over-the-top  way.  They  do  involve 
the trying to photograph women in compromising ways to show you either – what 
they’re wearing under their skirts.
…Working  in  packs  deliberately.  Deliberately  running  in  front  of  people.  I  mean, 
you know, hearsay, I’m afraid, but I’ve heard it second-hand that they’ve seen one 
photographer deliberately get into a fight with a celebrity so a second photographer, 
with whom they were working as a team, could get the picture of the fight and split 
the money.”

F

5.12  When  asked  whether  he  doubted  the  truth  of  the  evidence  given  by  some  of  the  Core 
Participant  Victims  of  paparazzi  harassment,  Mr  Turner  confirmed  that  he  did  not  doubt 
any of it.287 His explanation for this kind of behaviour was simple: there was demand in the 
marketplace for the images resulting from the harassment.288

5.13  That  appeared  to  reflect  the  evidence  given  by  witnesses  representing  picture  agencies. 
Gary Morgan, from Splash picture agency, confirmed that the market places a premium on 
exclusive photographs of individuals in the public eye. Photographs taken at press events or 
organised functions, where many photographers will be present, are inevitably worth less than 
photographs taken in more private situations, where there are fewer other photographers 
present.289 As such, there is an incentive on photographers to push the boundaries of what is 
an acceptable level of intrusion in order to get exclusive, and often private, images.

284 The taking and publication of photographs of Prince Harry, discussed at Part F, Chapter 7, section 8 below, is a prime 
example of this.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public5.14  Mr  Lyons  confirmed  that  in  order  to  get  valuable  photographs  his  photographers,  or 
freelancers, would pursue individuals by car or scooter, and would use the aggressive car 
shot technique described above.290 Matthew Sprake, of Newspics, confirmed that he happily 
used hidden cameras to photograph subjects.291

5.15  What was striking about the evidence received from Mr Morgan, Mr Lyons and Mr Sprake 
was  that  apparently  Splash,  Big  Pictures  and  Newspics  did  not  have  any  code  of  practice 
or  guidance  to  identify  acceptable  or  unacceptable  behaviour  for  staff  or  freelance 
photographers. All three witnesses noted that they sought to comply with the Editors’ Code 
(despite the fact they are not bound by it) but, as Mr Morgan noted, the Editors’ Code is “not 
comprehensive  enough  for  photographers  generally”  as  it  is  “directed  mainly  towards  the 
print side of journalism rather than the digital age or photographers generally”.292 It was also 
clear that each photo agency had very limited control or oversight over the behaviour of the 
freelance photographers from whom they purchased photographs. Mr Lyons said expressly 
that freelance photographers were not the responsibility of Big Pictures.293

5.16  Of greater concern was the evidence from Mr Sprake and Mr Lyons which demonstrated a 
lack of consideration for the privacy and dignity of the subjects of their photographers. Mr 
Sprake’s evidence revealed that ethical considerations about privacy and harassment played 
a very limited role in the planning and execution of photographic assignments: if a newspaper 
commissioned his agency to get photographs proving rumours of a new relationship or affair, 
proving the accuracy or otherwise of the rumour was the primary consideration, and the 
avoidance of harassment or breaches of privacy appeared to be very much secondary in his 
thinking.294 Mr Lyons’ evidence indicated a general disregard for the dignity of individuals in 
the public eye. In his book ‘Mr Paparazzi’, he had said:295

“All these truths about the nature of celebrity mean that when Big Pictures is out 
there papping the stars, some will claim that to an extent we’re imposing on their 
privacy and causing them some kind of distress. My answer to that is simple: if you 
can’t hack the job, don’t wear the hat.”

5.17  His evidence to the Inquiry largely confirmed that view. Asked about a series of privacy and/
or harassment judgments made against Big Pictures, Mr Lyons was either unable to recall 
the details, gave inaccurate details,296 or was unwilling to accept that Big Pictures had acted 
unethically.297  He  considered  that  “we  live  in  a  world  of  voyeurism”.298  His  view  appeared 
to be that because “50 per cent of celebrities want to be photographed and they love it for 
their own self gain in terms of financial back pocket and to make them more famous”,299 then 
the other 50 per cent who might also be styled as celebrities should accept the intrusion

of  photographers  on  whatever  terms  the  photographers  chose.  The  only  time  he  would 
choose not to photograph a celebrity was where the litigation risk would be too high: “it’s a 
purely commercial decision”, he said, and therefore not one based on any ethical principle or 
personal sensitivity.300

5.18  A  number  of  witnesses  suggested  that  it  was  often  difficult  to  tell  whether  an  individual 
photograph  taken  by  a  freelance  paparazzo  amounted  to  a  breach  of  privacy  and/or 
harassment of the subject. Although this may sometimes be so in relation to an individual 
photograph viewed in isolation, I suspect that very often the press are supplied with a series 
of photographs taken on the same occasion, and that it may not be overly difficult for an 
experienced picture editor to make informed judgments based on an overall impression.

5.19  Assessed  in  the  round,  the  evidence  indicated  a  significant  regulatory  gap  in  relation  to 
independent or freelance paparazzi and press photographers. It is important to recognise 
the symbiotic relationship between the press and paparazzi. As Mr Turner noted, it is the 
press that creates much of the market for paparazzi photographs. Clause 4 of the Editors’ 
Code requires editors to ensure they do not use material which derives from intimidation, 
harassment or persistent pursuit.  If  that principle  were applied  properly, and  newspapers 
refused to purchase or publish those images taken in situations of harassment, one might 
expect  a  substantial  reduction  in  harassing  behaviour  from  independent  and  freelance 
photographers. As witnesses such as Sir John Major suggested to the Inquiry, newspapers 
should be held strictly accountable in the context of the Editors’ Code for the photographs 
they chose to publish, regardless of their source. Furthermore, it should be standard practice 
to  require  newspapers  to  print  the  name  of  the  photographer  or  the  agency  against  any 
published photograph.

5.20  That said, the preponderance of the evidence provided by newspaper photo-editors suggested 
that most newspaper titles do scrutinise the photographs submitted to them by agencies 
and freelancers, do reject those photographs which appear to have been taken in breach of 
the Editors’ Code, and do seek to regulate the behaviour of their employed photographers. 
The  problem  which  the  evidence  has  identified  is  therefore  one  which  demands  careful 
consideration.

5.21  Mr  Silva  gave  evidence  of  one  of  the  more  comprehensive  systems  for  managing  and 
monitoring the behaviour of photographers. His employed and freelance photographers are 
given  strict  guidelines  on  how  to  conduct  themselves,  often  tailored  to  the  specific  tasks 
allocated.301 In relation to photographs submitted by freelancers, he identified 11 different 
factors that were considered before deciding to publish.302 Most of these considerations were 
sensible and praiseworthy: for how long was the photographer taking photographs; was the 
subject aware they were being photographed; was the subject harassed in any way? One was 
more problematic. Mr Silva would consider whether the subject of the photograph was in a 
public or private place but his view, which he had not discussed with his editor or with the 
PCC, was that there would be no reasonable expectation of privacy on a public street.303 The 
natural consequence of that approach is that those in the public eye are unable to exit their 
homes without the threat of intrusion by photographers. Nonetheless, overall, the factors 
considered by Mr Silva were exemplary and, applied consistently, ought to prevent much of 
the harassment complained of.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public5.22  Mr  Silva  gave  examples  of  how  the  application  of  these  principles  had  often  led  to  the 
rejection of photographs submitted to the Daily Mail, including: photographs of a member of 
the Royal Family and a celebrity were rejected because the subjects may have been followed 
prior to the photograph; a photograph of a celebrity entering another celebrity’s home was 
rejected  because  Mr  Silva  was  unhappy  that  a  photographer  was  outside  the  celebrity’s 
home; pictures of a celebrity holding a baby were rejected because they were shot through 
a second floor window and were clearly intrusive.304 Those examples suggested an effective 
system in place to discourage or prevent harassment.

5.23  The Sun’s picture editor John Edwards was not able clearly to identify the list of factors taken 
into account when deciding whether to publish photographs, but his evidence was that he 
too took care to review photographs prior to publication to ensure they did not breach privacy 
and were not taken in situations of harassment. He had rejected photographs of, for example, 
a well-known singer attending cancer treatment, photographs of a TV presenter taking her 
children to school, and a photograph of a heavily pregnant Ms Allen in a public street.305

5.24  Michael Lidbury of the Daily Express,306 Liz Cocks of the Mail on Sunday,307 and Mark Moylan of 
the People308 gave evidence of slightly different approaches to managing staff photographers 
and assessing photographs sent in by freelancers, but all three shared a general approach 
which suggested that care was taken to avoid harassment, and/or to avoid the publication of 
photographs taken in situations of harassment.

5.25  The  evidence  of  picture  editors  was  nonetheless  concerning.  There  appears  to  be  a  gap 
between the in-principle approach discussed by the picture editors and the experiences of 
those who have been subjected to harassment, as described above. From the oral evidence 
of Mr Silva and Mr Edwards,309 it appeared that the Editors’ Code and/or the self-imposed 
principles for preventing harassment are not applied as consistently as all the evidence from 
the picture editors might have suggested.

5.26 

In relation to the harassment of Ms Hong, Mr Edwards accepted that there was no rational 
difference  between  photographs  of  a  heavily  pregnant  Ms  Hong  on  a  public  street  and  a 
heavily pregnant Ms Allen on a public street. In his written evidence, Mr Edwards highlighted 
that he had chosen not to publish the photograph of Ms Allen because he was sensitive to her 
privacy given her advanced stage of pregnancy and, having checked with her PR representative, 
discovered that she did not want the photographs published.310 However, he defended The 
Sun’s publication of photographs of Ms Hong in an advanced stage of pregnancy, at a time 
when she was regularly pursued by photographers, without reference to her and without 
consideration of her privacy or concerns for harassment. He could not adequately explain 
why he had adopted a different approach in each case.311

309 Mr Silva and Mr Edwards were the only picture editors to give oral evidence. The following discussion therefore 
focuses on their evidence, but it should not be read as identifying any particular criticism of the two of them above any 
other. It is the principles that are important
310 In a letter to the Inquiry after the evidence gathering phase had been concluded, Mr Edwards said in the case of Ms 
Allen there was a need for increased sensitivity on account of Ms Allen’s previous miscarriages. However, although this 
was no doubt an additional consideration, it still does not adequately explain the treatment of Ms Hong

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

5.27  Similarly, in Mr Silva’s written evidence he had highlighted the fact that he had previously 
rejected photographs taken outside a celebrity’s home on the basis that he was unhappy 
that the photographer was stationed outside their home.312 However, in the case of Ms Hong, 
Mr Silva saw no objection to what he considered was the ‘normal response’ of sending a 
photographer to the home of Ms Hong after hearing of the birth of her child.313 In what might 
be seen as a conflation of the public interest with what interests the public, Mr Silva denied 
that the birth of Mr Grant’s child was a private matter and noted that “it was a major showbiz 
story which was of great interest to our readers and that’s the reason why we sent”.314 That 
justification was echoed by Mr Edwards who, when asked whether he agreed that it was clear 
that it was a private situation, said: “It’s a difficult call. Mr Grant is of huge interest to our 
readers, and I think – you know, he’s an A list Hollywood actor who everyone’s very interested 
in.”315

5.28  Neither Mr Silva nor Mr Edwards had considered calling Mr Grant’s PR in advance to inquire 
whether photographers would be welcomed. Although Mr Silva claimed that his photographer 
would  have  left  immediately  if  he  had  been  told  he  was  not  welcome,316  Mr  Grant’s 
evidence was that when he arrived at the house he made it very clear that photographers 
were not welcome.317 However, despite this, the photographers (including the Daily Mail’s 
photographer) remained and did not leave until asked to do so by the PCC. This somewhat 
undermines  the  claims  of  a  number  of  newspapers  that  the  photographers  were  simply 
waiting to see if Ms Hong would willingly pose for a photograph with the child. If there were 
any doubt about that, Mr Grant made clear that she would not do so but the photographers 
remained nonetheless.

5.29  The individual decisions of the Daily Mail and The Sun to publish a photograph of a heavily 
pregnant Ms Hong on a public street, or like the other newspapers who did the same, to 
send  a  single  photographer  to  her  house  shortly  after  she  had  given  birth,  may  not  have 
led inevitably to harassment. But the collective decisions of numerous photo-editors, photo-
agencies and freelance paparazzi, certainly did. And it is this collective responsibility which 
often gives rise to the problem.

5.30 

In relation to the publication of photographs of Ms Hong, Mr Edwards argued that there could 
be no reasonable objection to the publication of a single photograph of an individual taken 
in a public place which did not appear to be taken in circumstances of harassment. In the 
abstract, that must be correct. But, very often, for the subject of the photograph, that single 
photograph taken in a single public place will be one of many photographs taken in many 
public  places  by  many  photographers,  over  a  course  of  many  weeks,  months  or  years.  In 
those circumstances the “single” photograph in a “single” public place may not evidence any 
harassment precisely because the harassment is evidenced by the cumulative experience. I 
recognise that this makes it very difficult for editors and photo-editors to assess the ethics 

312 In a subsequent letter to the Inquiry, sent after Inquiry had concluded its evidence gathering phase, Mr Silva 
claimed that he had different reasons for rejecting that particular photograph, namely that there was evidence that 
the celebrity had been followed. This may be so, but it was not the reason put forward in his written evidence: para

652

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicof publishing a particular photograph, but assess these they must. And, in doing so, one of 
the important considerations is the collective and/or cumulative impact of the decisions of 
numerous titles to take or publish photographs of the same subject. If that is in doubt, a 
phone call to the representative of the subject, much like the phone call Mr Edwards made to 
Ms Allen’s PR , may provide an answer.

5.31  With  regard  to  the  presence  of  multiple  photographers  outside  Ms  Hong’s  home,  all 
competing for a photograph, and unwilling to leave when requested, it is difficult to see how 
that can be justified as ethical or Code-compliant behaviour. All photo-editors responsible 
for  sending  photographers  to  Ms  Hong’s  home  must  have  been  aware  that  it  was  highly 
likely that there would be a pack of photographers outside her house, and that the situation 
could  be  oppressive  for  the  new  mother.318  In  that  context,  and  when  Mr  Grant  made  it 
clear that photographers were not welcome, it is difficult to understand why, applying the 
general principles contained in all of the picture editors’ evidence, the photographers present 
remained at the house until the PCC issued a desist request to all newspaper editors.

5.32  Although Colin Myler praised the effectiveness of PCC desist notices in circumstances like 
those endured by Ms Hong,319 the need to issue such a notice reflects a failure on the part 
of  editors  to  ensure  that  their  photographers  comply  with  the  code  of  conduct  to  which 
the titles are committed. If the PCC can see that a situation of harassment has developed, 
responsible editors should recognise that fact too.

5.33  The  harassment  experienced  by  the  McCanns  on  their  return  from  Portugal,  discussed 
above320  is  another  prime  example  of  where  responsible  editors  and  photo-editors  could 
not  reasonably  claim  to  have  been  unaware  of  the  harassment  experienced,  but  where 
employed  and  freelance  photographers,  as  well  as  journalists,  were  sent  to  pursue  the 
McCanns nonetheless. Mr Edwards could see in retrospect that the situation they faced was 
unacceptable321  but,  at  the  time,  he  had  sent  his  photographer  to  join  the  pack  who  had 
gathered outside their house. Mr Silva also acknowledged that, with hindsight, “possibly” 
some of the photographs (in particular those featuring unpixellated images of the McCann 
children) should not have been used,322 but noted that the story was “unique”, “intense” and 
one of the most difficult he had had to work on.323

5.34 

In my view, there are a number of reasons why there is such a disjunction between the general 
principles articulated by photo-editors to prevent harassment and the specific examples of 
harassment heard by the Inquiry. I accept that a good deal of the harassment experienced 
by those in the public eye is caused by unregulated freelancers. I also accept that the British 
press has only limited influence over those freelancers: although the British press can reduce 
the market for photographs obtained in situations of harassment, the harassers can still sell 
into the international market.

318 In addition, whether Mr Silva, in particular, knew it or not, Daily Mail journalists had been calling Ms Hong 
repeatedly and leaving messages on her answer-phone; in consequence she already felt pressured by journalists. Mr 
Silva’s evidence and subsequent letter to the Inquiry did not address this broader context, but it is another example of 
how the experience of harassment may be cumulative and cannot be considered without regard to that wider context

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF5.35  However, it is clear from the evidence provided to the Inquiry that not all of the blame for 
harassment of those in the public eye can be levelled at the unregulated freelance paparazzi. 
The British press has been guilty of publishing photographs clearly taken in circumstances 
of harassment, and employed photographers and journalists have been guilty of harassing 
behaviour. It is possible that, contrary to the evidence given to the Inquiry, editors and photo-
editors do not, in general, take care to avoid harassment.

5.36  Taking this in the round, I believe that the evidence provided to the Inquiry by photo-editors 
was essentially genuine, and that photo-editors and editors alike do, in general, try to take 
care  to  avoid  situations  of  harassment.  However,  there  appear  to  be  two  general  factors 
which conspire against that care which means that the harassment of individuals continues. 
First, some of the harassment experienced by witnesses to the Inquiry is the consequence of 
collective and cumulative decisions by photo-editors and editors, rather than single obvious 
breaches of the Editors’ Code: each individual publication’s decision might appear justified, 
but the collective and cumulative decisions of many editors over a period of time are not. 
Editors must face up to this problem.

5.37 

In a letter to the Inquiry, Mr Edwards referred to the treatment of the McCanns  on their 
return from Portugal, acknowledging again that the situation was unacceptable. He blamed 
it  on  a  “collective”  problem  for  which  television  crews  and  international  press  were  also 
responsible, but defended The Sun, denying that it had made any inappropriate publication 
decision. That cannot be right in circumstances where The Sun had a photographer within the 
pack outside the McCanns’ home. It is one thing to say that there is a collective problem and 
we are all responsible. It is another thing entirely to say that there is a collective problem, and 
therefore we cannot be held responsible individually.

F

5.38  Second,  it  seems  that  where  a  story  is  too  big,  as  in  the  case  of  the  McCanns,  or  where 
a  readership’s  interest  in  a  celebrity  is  too  great,  as  in  the  case  of  Mr  Grant,  the  general 
principles applied to avoid harassment are relaxed, or even set to one side. That is consistent 
with Piers Morgan’s observation in a note to Assistant Chief Constable Jeremy Kirkby that 
“Fame and crime sends most of the usual rules out of the window”.324 It is also consistent 
with two observations made in other parts of this Report: first, that where the perceived 
imperatives of very big stories are concerned, there is a tendency to disregard the rule book, 
and second, that there has been, within parts of the press, a conflation of the public interest 
with what interests the public, such that individual privacy and dignity is ignored to satisfy 
the demands of a readership.325

5.39  Mr  Peppiatt’s  evidence  appeared  to  support  this  conclusion.  He  told  of  his  pursuit  of  the 
Britain’s Got Talent star Susan Boyle, at a time when there was huge international interest 
in her story. Under enormous pressure after her sudden rise to fame, Ms Boyle had been 
acting unpredictably and “lashing out”. The producers of Britain’s Got Talent had sent her to 
Scotland for some time out to relax and recover and the press were expressly asked to leave 
her alone. Mr Peppiatt recalled that this request was “like a red rag to a bull” for the Daily 
Star, which sent him to Scotland to pursue her and to make a mock marriage proposal. Mr 
Peppiatt spent a week pursuing Ms Boyle around Scotland before making the mock proposal, 
undoubtedly adding to the stress she was under. Mr Peppiatt said:326

overstepped the mark with harassment.”

intrusion into grief and shock
Partly a subset of harassment, a further complaint that has been levelled at the press is that 
it  has  shown  insufficient  respect  for  the  special  sensitivity  of  those  grieving  the  death  of 
those close to them, or in shock from tragic events. The press intrusion experienced by the 
McCanns, the Dowlers, and the Bowles family,327 are some of the more high profile examples 
of this complaint. But the Inquiry heard evidence of many more examples.

As  historic  context,  Disaster  Action,  a  charity  founded  by  the  survivors  and  bereaved  of 
disasters reminded the Inquiry of The Sun’s coverage of the Hillsborough Disaster, in which 
96 Liverpool FC fans lost their lives, as an example of the appalling impact that insensitive 
and  irresponsible  reporting  of  death  and  disaster  can  have.328  Under  the  headline  “THE 
TRUTH”, The Sun published a story containing assertions that some fans picked the pockets of 
victims, urinated on police officers (‘brave cops’) and ‘beat up PC giving kiss of life’. Although 
this report has long been undermined, the myth has persisted.329 The reality has now been 
very substantially exposed in the publication of the report of the Hillsborough Independent 
Panel.330

In a statement issued after the publication of the report of the Panel, Mr MacKenzie (then 
editor of The Sun) asserted that he was misled when “handed a piece of copy from a reputable 
news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and senior local MP were making 
serious allegations against fans in the stadium” and that he had “absolutely no reason to 
believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster”. He said he 
published in good faith. A contrary account comes from Harry Arnold, the reporter who had 
drafted the story; he told the BBC that he was “aghast” when he saw the headline, saying 
that the story he had prepared had been written in “a fair and balanced way” because he 
appreciated that they were no more than allegations.331 He challenged Mr MacKenzie at the 
time saying that he could not say what was written in the article because “we don’t know it’s 
the truth”; Mr MacKenzie brushed the point aside responding “Oh, don’t worry. I’m going to 
make it clear that this is what some people are saying”.

6.4 

The relevance of the story to this Inquiry shines out of the editorial in The Sun on 13 September 
2012 which was in these terms:332

“The Sun’s reporting of the Hillsborough tragedy 23 years ago is without doubt the 
blackest day in this newspaper’s history. ... It highlights a concerted campaign ... to 
smear the innocent by fabricating lurid allegations about Liverpool fans – and then 
feeding them to the media.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

But it is to the eternal discredit of The Sun that we reported as fact this misinformation 
which tarnished the reputation of Liverpool fans including the 96 victims. ...
The role of a newspaper is to uncover injustice. To forensically examine the claims 
made by those who are in positions of power. In the aftermath of the Hillsborough 
tragedy we failed. And by failing in our duty we heaped more misery on the families 
of those who lost their lives and the people of Liverpool.
Nothing can excuse The Sun’s Page One presentation, under the heading The Truth. 
It was inaccurate, grossly insensitive and offensive. This version of events was NOT 
the truth.”

6.8 

The extent of this egregious failure, now fully recognised (but not previously in the 23 years 
that  have  elapsed),  exemplifies  many  of  the  concerns  which  have  been  ventilated  in  the 
Inquiry, not the least in relation to the intrusion into grief and shock, but also in relation to 
accuracy (discussed below). It also underlines the enormous power of the press and, as a 
consequence, its absolute obligation to exercise that power responsibly. The press has real 
influence in our society and is given privileges in law in order to fulfil its function. The story 
underlines the need for a regulatory mechanism to challenge the press and to require it to 
justify itself.

If  the  Hillsborough  reporting  represented  large  scale  intrusion  into  grief  and  shock,  the 
Inquiry heard extensive evidence of smaller scale, but equally distressing coverage of death 
and tragedy. Margaret and James Watson told the Inquiry of the insensitive reporting of their 
daughter’s murder by a fellow student in the 1980s. The articles published in the Glasgow 
Herald and in Marie Claire magazine, which, contrary to the clear conclusions expressed at the 
trial, sought to portray their daughter’s murderer as a victim and their daughter as involved in 
a feud with the murderer, caused the couple and their son immense anguish which was still 
clearly felt when they gave evidence.333

Similar anguish was caused by the reporting of the death of Ms Diamond’s son in 1991. Only 
an hour after Ms Diamond found her son dead, photographers and journalists began to knock 
at her door. The pack that arrived was so large that the family priest was too intimidated 
to  enter  the  house.  A  photographer  was  seen  sitting  on  Ms  Diamond’s  back  wall,  trying 
to  photograph  the  grieving  family  in  their  garden;  a  journalist  tried  to  force  her  way  into 
the house on the pretence of delivering flowers. Despite the family’s express requests for 
the  funeral  to  be  private,  a  freelance  photographer  took  photos  of  Ms  Diamond  and  her 
husband with their son’s coffin. Further, despite express requests not to do so, The Sun ran 
the photograph on its front page the following day. Ms Diamond recalled the series of events 
as a great violation of her privacy and an enormous intrusion into her private grief.334

It  might  be  said  that  the  evidence  of  Ms  Diamond,  along  with  that  of  the  Watsons  and 
the  Hillsborough  example,  are  of  purely  historical  interest,  given  that  they  each  relate  to 
publications more than 20 years ago. But the evidence heard by the Inquiry does not support 
that view. The experiences of the McCanns, the Dowlers and the Bowles family, all of which 
occurred much more recently, suggest that parts of the press can continue, on occasion, to 
display a cavalier attitude to intrusions into shock or grief.

Evidence from other witnesses supports that view as well. Shortly after Mr Mosley’s son died 
in 2009, up to 15 journalists and/or photographers camped outside his son’s home, hoping 
to snap a photograph of Mr Mosley exiting the house. Only after his solicitors threatened 
to bring an action for harassment did the journalists leave.335 Similar evidence was given to 
the Culture Media and Sport (CMS) Select Committee by Tim Fuller, the father of a girl who 
had committed suicide in 2008 and who had been unable to go to his daughter’s house for 
days after her death because it was surrounded by press.336 Likewise, in the aftermath of her 
daughter’s stabbing, Baroness Hollins was door-stepped by journalists and photographers, 
subject to subterfuge by journalists pretending to be doctors, and photographed with long 
lens cameras while on private family outings.337

6.10  The  harassment  and  intrusion  of  which  these  witnesses  complained  appears  to  be  borne 
from a culture of indifference, within parts of the press, to the sensitivities of those who are 
grieving or in shock; that indifference is doubtless borne out of an anxiety to capture the ‘big’ 
story. Mr Peppiatt gave evidence of a story he had written immediately after the suicide of 
Kevin McGee, the ex-partner of television personality Matt Lucas. On the day of Mr McGee’s 
death, the Daily Star was telephoned by a source who made sensational claims about the 
drug  and  alcohol  abuse  that  had  caused  Mr  McGee’s  death.  The  source  also  alleged  that 
Mr Lucas was on suicide watch himself. Although Mr Peppiatt was keen to meet the source 
to verify the claims, he was told to write and publish the story immediately without further 
checking. Prior to publication, no consideration was given to the sensitivity of those close 
to Mr McGee, nor apparently to the truth of the story. Mr Peppiatt noted that within the 
newspaper “there was certainly the consideration that the man is dead, therefore you can’t 
really libel him.”338 Mr Lucas successfully sued the newspaper and was awarded damages for 
breach of privacy and for libel (insofar as the libel related to him rather than Mr McGee).339

6.11  Mr Peppiatt recalled that he expected to be disciplined in some way in the aftermath of the 
litigation for his part in the story. But no internal inquiries were made and no disciplinary 
action taken. Mr Peppiatt considered that the attitude of the newspaper was that the damages 
award was simply part of the cost of doing business.340

6.12  The Daily Mail’s Mr Dacre was asked about an article on the death of Boyzone singer, Stephen 
Gately, which had given rise to over 25,000 PCC complaints. A post-mortem examination had 
found Mr Gately to have died of natural causes. The article speculated, with some conviction 
but no factual basis, that his death could not have been natural, but must have been linked 
to a “dangerous” homosexual lifestyle. His death was associated with the death of Mr McGee 
and was said to “strike a blow to the happy-ever-after myth of civil partnerships”.341 In his 
evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Dacre said that he wished that the article had been subject to 
more judicious sub-editing, but he defended the journalist’s right to express her view in the 
newspaper.342 The PCC adopted the same approach, criticising parts of the article but deciding

that it did not amount to a breach of the Editors’ Code because “it would not be proportionate 
to rule against the columnist’s right to offer freely expressed views about something that was 
the focus of public attention”.343

6.13  The conclusion of the PCC is surprising. A columnist is, of course, entitled freely to express his 
or her views. But where those views had no factual basis, were expressed very shortly after 
Mr Gately’s death, and intruded into the grief of those who loved him, it is difficult to see how 
that did not amount to a breach of the requirements of the Editors’ Code that newspapers 
should handle sensitively stories which intrude on personal grief or shock. In any case, the 
publication of the story, which the PCC recognised was in poor taste, displayed a disregard for 
the grief of the friends and family of Mr Gately.

6.14  There may be some truth in the old chestnut that “if it bleeds, it leads”. The reporting of 
crime, and the reporting of the death of those in the public eye, will always be an important 
and valuable part of the press. As noted by Baroness Hollins, the majority of the press achieve 
this with sensitivity and care.344 But it is clear to me that a significant minority does not. To 
that minority, death or tragedy is treated as just another news story, to be reported without 
regard to the special considerations that ought to apply to protect the friends and family of 
the subjects of the stories.

6.15  To address the failings of this minority, Mr and Mrs Watson proposed a change in the law 
to  allow  the  family  of  the  dead  to  sue  for  libel.345  It  is  an  interesting  idea  and  one  which 
may  well  have  positive  effects  in  some  cases,  although  it  would  cause  real  complications 
and difficulties in others: would, say, the family of Sir Winston Churchill be able to sue if a 
published book was defamatory of him? Furthermore, it is a change that would not address 
the wider problems of the harassment by journalists and photographers of those grieving the 
loss of loved ones, and truthful but insensitive reporting in the aftermath of death or tragedy. 
To address those wider issues, it is not a change in the law but a change in culture that is 
required, to ensure that those who are responsible for reporting, photographing, and editing 
stories of death and tragedy treat those who may be grieving or in shock with the dignity they 
deserve. It is clearly not impossible to do so because so many, much of the time, do so. It is 
difficult, therefore, to see why it should not be the practice of all.

7.  treatment of children
7.1 

A further criticism made by some Core Participants to the Inquiry was the failure of parts 
of the press to treat children with dignity and respect. As noted in the evidence of Stephen 
Abell,  then  Director  of  the  PCC,  the  Editors’  Code  imposes  tight  restrictions  to  safeguard 
the  interests  of  children,  and  its  terms  are  interpreted  broadly  to  provide  a  high  level  of 
protection to children. Although a public interest exception may allow for the publication of 
private information about children, the public interest justification must be “exceptional” to 
outweigh the “paramount interests” of children.346 No-one who gave evidence to the Inquiry 
suggested that the Code was in any way defective in providing this higher level of protection 
to children, but the evidence suggested that it was not always observed by parts of the press.

In her evidence, Ms Church revealed a disrespect from photographers, journalists and editors 
for her own privacy when a child, and subsequently a disregard for her children’s privacy 
once she was a mother. As noted above, Ms Church told the Inquiry that, after the birth of 
her daughter, when six paparazzi were waiting outside her house for a photograph of the 
baby, she chose to sell managed photographs to OK! Magazine rather than face the pack 
of photographers: the idea was to allow the photographs to be taken in the hope that she 
would then be left alone. Rosie Nixon, the editor of Hello! Magazine, told the Inquiry of the 
pressure experienced by new mothers in Ms Church’s position, as there was a “sort of bounty 
on the head of that child for the first photos. They can make a paparazzo a lot of money”.347 
The harassment experienced by Ms Church after the birth of her child was shared by Ms Hong 
after giving birth to Mr Grant’s child,348 and by Ms Rowling after the birth of her children.349

The Inquiry was told that the demand for photographs and information about the children of 
those in the public eye continued well beyond the early days of the childrens’ lives. Mr Coogan 
spoke of the publication, without consent, of a photograph of his seven year old and five year 
old children.350 In addition to the many examples given by Ms Rowling of photographers seeking 
to take (and newspaper titles publishing) photographs of her children without consent, she 
told the Inquiry of a journalist placing a note in her five year old daughter’s schoolbag,351 and 
another journalist contacting the headmaster at her 15 year old daughter’s school to discuss 
private (and fabricated) information about her daughter.352 The intolerable levels of press and 
paparazzi harassment experienced by the McCanns on their return to Portugal was suffered 
not only by Drs Kate and Gerry McCann, but also by their two and a half year old twins who 
were with them throughout and who found the experience very upsetting. Photographs of 
the  twins  were  published  in  numerous  newspapers,  without  pixellation,  and  without  any 
clear justification except for the fact that the story was “unique” and “intense”.353

A further, high profile example of this failure was the decision of The Sun newspaper, in 2006, 
to publish private medical information about the son of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
the Mr Brown, discussed above.354

All of these examples suggested that parts of the press failed to abide by the Editors’ Code 
generally, but specifically failed to abide by the requirement not to use the fame or notoriety 
of a parent as sole justification for publishing private details of a child.

7.6  When considering the evidence in the round, it is fair to say that the press tends to be more 
respectful  of  the  privacy  of  children  than  that  of  adults:  there  were  substantially  fewer 
complaints heard by the Inquiry in relation to children than in relation to adults, and even 
the Browns noted that, since The Sun’s publication of medical information about their child, 
the  press  has  generally  refrained  from  publishing  photographs  of,  or  information  about, 
their children. However, the fact that unethical press practices in relation to children are less 
frequent, or limited to a smaller section of the press, does not mean that there is less urgency

suggests that the Editors’ Code continues to be breached in relation to children. The reason 
for the Editors’ Code is obvious: to those whose children have been unjustifiably exposed to 
the public gaze, and to the children themselves, the damage caused can be significant.

8.	 Representation	of	women	and	minorities

8.1 

Introduction
A different kind of criticism made by those who submitted evidence to the Inquiry was that 
the representation of women and minorities (such as immigrants or asylum seekers), at least 
in  parts  of  the  press,  is  discriminatory  and  ill-considered.  What  makes  these  complaints 
different from those which precede them is that they are complaints on behalf of classes of 
people, rather than a series of individuals. Under the complaints system operated by the PCC, 
which normally requires an individual complainant who was individually affected by a story, 
this  kind  of  complaint  was  not  ordinarily  admissible.356  Accordingly,  the  Inquiry  provided 
a first opportunity for a number of representative groups to express their concerns about 
discriminatory press reporting.

8.2 

The starting point for an accurate examination of this topic is the Editors’ Code of Practice, 
the relevant provisions of which specify as follows:357

F

‘It is essential that an agreed code should be honoured not only to the letter but in the 
full spirit. It should not be interpreted so narrowly as to compromise its commitment 
to  respect  for  the  rights  of  the  individual,  nor  so  broadly  that  it  constitutes  an 
unnecessary interference with freedom of expression or prevents publication in the 
public interest.
...

1. Accuracy

The press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information, 
including pictures.
...

12. Discrimination

(i)  The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual’s race, 
colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any form of physical or mental 
illness or disability.

(ii)  Details of an individual’s race, colour, religion, sexual orientation, physical or 
mental illness or disability must be avoided unless genuinely relevant to the 
story.’

355 Part F, Chapter 7
356 However, the evidence suggested that exceptions were made to allow representative complaints in certain 
undefined circumstances: see, for example, the evidence of Stephen Abell at pp109-111, lines 17-15, http://www.

8.8 

In the context of this section of the Report, in theory, it is possible to envisage three types 
of  complaint  to  the  PCC  arising  out  of  these  provisions.  First,  a  complaint  brought  by  an 
individual of inaccurate, discriminatory and/or pejorative reporting directly relating to him or 
her. The vast majority of complaints of discrimination do not fall within this category. Second, 
a complaint brought by a group relating to an individual directly identified in the offending 
article,  where  that  individual  does  not  wish  to  bring  his  or  her  own  complaint.  Here,  no 
issue arises on the Code as such, because the case clearly falls within the language of clause 
12; the issue is the PCC’s policy. Third, a complaint brought by a group, relating to alleged 
discriminatory treatment of the group as a whole, rather than any one individual. This type 
of complaint does raise an issue on the terminology of the Code because clause 12 refers in 
terms to an individual’s personal characteristics, not to those of a group. Put simply, the Code 
would clearly be breached if an article attacked Mr Y on the basis that he was a member 
of a particular religious group, but it is far less clear that the same breach would occur if 
there were no mention, either express or implied, of Mr Y in the article and the attack were 
directed at the religious group in general.

A reading of the Code which takes on board its spirit rather than simply the letter probably 
does not surmount this difficulty. The only route to finding a violation of the Code in such a 
case would be by invoking clause 1, the requirement to be accurate. Some discriminatory 
reporting is too subjective and loosely worded to fall foul of this provision, but it is not too 
difficult to envisage examples of reporting which would engage it.

Those representing women’s and minority groups would be entitled to retort that if the Code 
as currently worded creates the kind of legalistic difficulties which have just been outlined, 
then the solution is a straightforward one: simply amend the Code. The force of this point 
is noted, but it should be considered in depth by any future regulator, rather than by this 
Inquiry.

The argument has also been put that there is an important issue of free speech in play here, and 
that the press is entitled to be partisan. Furthermore, matters of taste and decency are outside 
the Code, and properly should be. The force of these arguments needs to be recognised, but 
only in their proper context. For example, putting to one side issues concerned with domestic 
violence, material which is pornographic and demeaning to women does not violate clauses 1 
and 12 of the Code, and is readily available in pornographic magazines subject to the general 
law. This material is offensive to many, but an issue does arise for consideration as to whether 
a regulator of a free press which is entitled to be tasteless and indecent should be intervening 
in this sort of area.

On  the  other  hand,  most  people  would  argue  that  obviously  racially  offensive  material, 
which on one level might be said to be partisan in tone and content and therefore defensible 
as falling within the prerogative of a free press, should be capable of being the subject of 
regulatory comment notwithstanding the absence of an obvious first party complainant. It 
must be recognised, however, that there are many cases along the spectrum where reasonable 
people will disagree.

At the very least, the issue is both complex and sensitive. The Inquiry heard from a number 
of groups who advanced powerful arguments in favour of greater regulation, in particular 
for greater balance. Although the Inquiry received much evidence and submission devoted 
to the issue of the value of a free press in general terms, few came forward to advance the 
contrary case to that put forward by the groups I have mentioned. Sunday Sport (2011) Ltd 
has recently filed a series of well-argued and sustained submissions emphasising the free 
speech issues and drawing attention to the fact that, in its view, the Inquiry has not received

a representative spread of the available factual and opinion evidence. Dominic Mohan, the 
editor of The Sun, made a spirited defence of Page 3. He is not to be criticised for doing so, 
and many will feel that Page 3 of The Sun raises a taste and decency issue and none other. 
The point I am seeking to make at this stage is that I am alive to all the arguments and to the 
fact that, on what might be called the central ground, there is room for reasonable, opposing 
points of view.

8.9 

Representation of women
Object, the human rights organisation, gave comprehensive evidence to the Inquiry of what 
it  described  as  “the  sexual  objectification  of  women  and  girls,  and  the  mainstreaming  of 
the  sex  and  porn  industries  in  the  media  and  popular  culture”.358  Its  evidence  focused  on 
“Page 3 imagery”, namely imagery found in The Sun, the Midweek and Sunday Sport, and the 
Daily and Sunday Star, of young (almost always white) women with bare breasts, sometimes 
entirely nude and in sexualised poses. Anna Van Heeswijk, representing Object, described “a 
gradient of extremity running from the Sun to the Daily Star to the Sport”:359 although Page 3 
imagery is limited to page 3 of The Sun, it is found on many more pages in the Daily Star and 
yet more still in the Sport. Indeed, The Sport contains a self-explanatory “nipple count” which 
often numbers over 100.360 In each of these titles, the posed photographs of topless women 
may be accompanied by stories including ‘up-skirt’ photographs, and extensive advertising 
for sex web cams, pornographic DVDs and ‘escort agencies’.361

8.10  Ms Van Heeswijk considered there was “no marked difference between the content which 
exists  within…  classified  pornographic  materials  and  the  contents  within  some  of  these 
mainstream Page 3 tabloids”.362 This may be putting it high with regard to The Sun, but it 
would be hard to disagree when looking at the coverage in the other titles. The front page of 
the Midweek Sport from 16 November 2011, for example, contained a full page photograph 
of a glamour model in a small red bikini, with her legs akimbo. Beside that photograph was a 
headline, “Top 50 Glamour Babes Ever – 8 page topless pullout”. To the top right of the page 
was a headline, “Pippa’s Amazing Bum Pic – Shock New Photo Inside”. To the bottom left was 
a censored photograph with the headline “Jess Goes Topless – Jungle Babe Bares Boobs – 
Uncensored”. At the very bottom of the page was the headline, “Two Free XXX Sex DVDs for 
every reader”.363

8.11  Ms Van Heeswijk argued that this type of material should not be on sale alongside other daily 
newspapers, but should be limited to the ‘top shelf’ alongside pornographic material. She 
noted:364

“Page  3  imagery  is  already  prohibited  in  the  workplace  under  sexual  harassment 
legislation  (set  out  most  recently  in  the  Equalities  Act  2010),  and  it  is  restricted 
from broadcast media before the 9pm watershed. It would therefore be logical to 
recommend that Page 3 images which are considered unacceptable in the workplace,

displayed in newspapers which are sold at child’s eye level with no age-restriction. 
These  recommendations  would  allow  for  consistency  in  media  regulation  when  it 
comes to keeping harmful materials out of the mainstream and away from children.”

8.12 

8.13 

It is hard to argue against that in respect of some of the material contained in the Sport at 
least, but the regulation of the sale of explicit print material does not fall directly within the 
scope of this Inquiry. Of greater potential concern to the Inquiry is the degree to which the 
images may reflect a wider cultural failure to treat women with dignity and respect and/or a 
practice which, intentionally or not, has the effect of demeaning and degrading women.

In respect of Page 3 imagery, there are a range of arguments. There are those, like Object 
and the recently formed internet group “No More Page 3”, who argue that the persistent 
representation of topless young women on the pages of national newspapers is inherently 
degrading and demeaning. By contrast, there are those like Mr Mohan, who argue that Page 
3 is “neither harmful nor offensive”, and satisfies the demands of a readership.365 Somewhere 
in between are those who argue that Page 3 is simply an anomaly: out of place in the 21st 
century where a woman is just as likely as a man to purchase (or edit) a tabloid newspaper, 
or lead the country.

8.14  The arguments between those who adopt each viewpoint will continue. But for the purposes 
of this Inquiry, the interesting point is that it was not Page 3 per se which gave rise to the 
core  complaints  made  by  women’s  groups.  Instead,  it  was  a  general  attitude  which  was 
found throughout the pages of those tabloids which contained images of semi-naked women 
(referred to as ‘Page 3 tabloids’), and of which Page 3 was only one example. Object, along 
with other organisations such as Turn Your Back on Page 3, Eaves Housing for Women, and 
the End Violence Against Women Coalition argued that Page 3 imagery was part of a broader 
culture of objectification and sexualisation of women in those newspapers. Ms Van Heeswijk 
wrote:

“This  pervasive objectification and sexualisation  of women is not restricted to the 
portrayal  of  the  Page  3  models  or  to  the  Page  3  type  feature.  Rather,  to  varying 
extents, it influences the way that almost all women are portrayed in Page 3 tabloids, 
including female celebrities. Examples include an article in the Daily Star on the size 
of  “15  year  old”  Charlotte  Church’s  breasts  (“She’s  a  big  girl  now…  Child  singing 
sensation showed just how quickly she’s grown up after turning up at a Hollywood 
bash looking chest swell”). This is juxtaposed with commentary of outrage against 
the satirical “sting” Brass Eye documentary’s “Paedophile special” (Exhibit 4). More 
recent  examples  include  a  feature  in  the  Sport  commenting  on  the  genitalia  of  a 
female newsreader which it describes in derogatory terms. (Exhibit 5)”366

8.15  Both  of  the  examples  given  in  that  passage  support  the  broader  points  made  by  Ms  Van 
Heeswijk and others. First, the unfortunate juxtaposition of the article expressing outrage at 
a satirical programme on paedophilia and an article commenting on a 15 year-old’s breasts 
exposes a hypocrisy in relation to the sexualisation of young girls and women that is seen 
beyond the Page 3 tabloids: some have commented on the awkward co-existence of the Daily 
Mail’s support for “traditional values” with the Mail Online’s “sidebar of shame”. Second, the 
article commenting on the genitalia of a female newsreader supports the view that some

Page 3 tabloids apply a demeaning and sexualising lens beyond those who choose to appear 
in their pages with breasts exposed: even the most accomplished and professional women 
are reduced to the sum of their body parts.

8.16  Object’s  submission  to  the  Inquiry  gave  examples  of  the  sexualisation  or  demeaning  of 
women from articles in The Sun, the Daily Star, and the Sport over a single week in November 
2011. The articles exhibited demonstrated the “gradient of extremity” from The Sun through 
the  Daily  Star  to  the  Sport,  but  all  three  titles  contained  what  can  only  be  described  as 
objectifying material.367 All three included numerous articles with no other purpose except 
to show an image of a scantily clad or topless woman: see, for instance, The Sun’s articles 
‘Jess takes the plunge’ and ‘Celeb beauty gets ‘em out’. All three titles included articles with 
no purpose other than to attach a photograph of, and describe in derogatory language, a 
woman’s breasts or bottom: see the Daily Star’s article about “getting a massive pervy eyeful 
of [a celebrity’s] pert ass”, or the Sport’s article ‘Jugs and Jury’. All three contained large scale 
advertisements for pornography and/or escort services. And all three included articles which 
appeared to eroticise violence against women.

8.17  This  final  category  of  article  was  forcefully  criticised  by  the  End  Violence  Against  Women 
Coalition and Eaves Housing who both argued that there was a tendency in parts of the press 
to trivialise and/or sexualise violence against women.368 One of the examples identified from 
The Sun was an article entitled ‘Bodyguards for battered Towie sisters’ reporting acts of serious 
violence upon two sisters, accompanied by a picture of one of them in an erotic pose in her 
underwear.369 A similar example from the Sport was an article, adjacent to a photograph of a 
large breasted, topless model, about a man who had committed a sexual offence by groping 
a woman’s breasts.370 A further example from the Sport involved a comment piece expressing 
the writer’s desire to have sex with a celebrity, but joking that the only way that would happen 
was if he raped her.371 Many more examples were made available to the Inquiry.372

8.18  The evidence as a whole suggested that there is force in the trenchant views expressed by 
the groups and organisations who testified to the Inquiry that the Page 3 tabloid press often 
failed to show consistent respect for the dignity and equality of women generally, and that 
there was a tendency to sexualise and demean women. That failure is particularly clear in the 
pages of the Sport, which is, in my view, hardly distinguishable from the admittedly ‘softer’ 
end of top-shelf pornography. But it exists to a lesser degree in the Daily Star and The Sun. 
For The Sun, at least, it is a failure of consistency, rather than a general failure to show respect 
for women. The Sun has campaigned admirably against domestic violence, rape, and size zero 
models.373 But it is clear that those campaigns have, perhaps uncomfortably, sat alongside 
demeaning and sexualising representations of women.

368 The Inquiry noted that the evidence suggested that this tendency was not limited to the Page 3 tabloids, but on the 
evidence as a whole concluded that a broad criticism relating to the representation of women could not be sustained 
against other newspapers

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public8.19 

Importantly,  these  criticisms  of  the  Page  3  tabloids  do  not  derive  from  the  fact  those 
newspapers contain an image of a topless woman on Page 3 (or not only from that fact). 
They are criticisms for which evidence can be found on a reading of all the pages in those 
newspapers as a whole. They are also supported by the response that the tabloids have made 
to those who have criticised Page 3.

8.20  When Clare Short MP campaigned against Page 3 in the 1980s she was described by The 
Sun as “fat”, “ugly” and “jealous of beautiful women”.374 When the Rt Hon Harriet Harman 
proposed legislation to ban Page 3 in 2010, she was described as a “harridan” and a “feminist 
fanatic”  on  a  “furious  rant”.375  Similarly,  when  ex-Equalities  Minister  Lynne  Featherstone 
MP raised the issue in Government, she was described as a “battleaxe” and her proposal to 
limit children’s ability to purchase newspapers containing topless women was described as a 
“potty plan”.376 Describing the female critics of Page 3 as fat, ugly, jealous, feminist fanatics, 
harridans, and battleaxes goes some way to proving their point.

8.21  Thus  far, these criticisms  have been  considered  at  a  level  of  some  abstraction;  it  remains 
necessary  to  bring  the  debate  back  to  the  terms  of  the  Code,  and  to  the  considerations 
foreshadowed in the introductory observations to this section. The article, ‘Bodyguards for 
Battered Towie Sisters’ may well infringe clause 12 of the Code as currently drafted, but the 
majority of the material discussed under this sub-heading probably does not. The impact of 
discriminatory or prejudicial representations of women in the Page 3 tabloids is difficult to 
judge. There is credible evidence that it has a broader impact on the perception and role of 
women in society, and the sexualisation of society generally,377 although submissions from 
Sunday Sport (2011) Ltd refer to the range of academic opinion on the issue. Suffice to say, 
that this Inquiry is not the place to analyse, let alone reach conclusions on these matters.

8.22  That  said,  these  are  important  and  sensitive  issues  which  merit  further  consideration  by 
any new regulator. What is clearly required is that any such regulator has the power to take 
complaints from representative women’s groups.  Consideration should also be given to Code 
amendments which, while protecting freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, would 
equip that body with the power to intervene in cases of allegedly discriminatory reporting 
and in so doing reflect the spirit of equalities legislation.

Representation of minorities

8.23  The  Inquiry  received  a  range  of  submissions  from  minority  groups,  as  well  as  individuals 
raising similar points on behalf of groups; the full range of these submissions is available on 
the Inquiry website. Of necessity, the summary below draws on a selection of the submissions 
that were received, but the points will be equally relevant to many of the others who wrote in 
and, indeed, many other groups who did not take the opportunity to do so.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFTransgender

8.24  Trans  Media  Watch  (TMW)  provided  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  of  disturbing  and  intrusive 

reporting of transgender and intersex issues by parts of the press.378 They wrote:379

“The  media  –  and  the  tabloid  press  in  particular  –  has  played  a  powerful  role  in 
creating and sustaining a climate of prejudice against transgender people. Worse… 
instances in which the tabloid press has created situations in which very vulnerable 
people (including transgender children) are “monstered” and face public abuse or the 
threat of violence are not hard to find. Nor is it difficult to discover stories in which 
transgender people have had their privacy shamelessly invaded, personal details that 
could place them in grave danger revealed (either unethically or even illegally), or lies 
circulated about them by the press. Entirely innocent individuals have been forced 
out of jobs and homes, even received death threats, on the basis of coverage in the 
British press.
Whilst an occasionally more sympathetic piece might appear, in a “human interest” 
setting, the tabloid press (especially) has consistently expressed almost no interest in 
behaving with human decency towards transgender people.”

8.25  The organisation said that the tabloid press in particular tended to fit stories about transgender 
issues within one of three categories: “trans as fraud”, “trans as undeserving” and “trans as 
deviant and deserving of parody”. To that list might be added “the outing of transgender 
people”. TMW provided to the Inquiry many examples of these kinds of stories. Within this 
report it is possible to refer to only a few, but the examples which follow are by no means 
aberrations.

F

8.26  Within the categories “trans as fraud” and “trans as undeserving” was an article published 
in the Daily Express and titled ‘Half Man Gets New Breasts (and guess who’s paying £78k)’. 
TMW said the article was not only inaccurate (the cost of gender reconstruction surgery is 
nowhere near as high as £78k), but it was also part of a narrative adopted by much of the 
tabloid press presenting transgender people as undeserving frauds using public money for 
illegitimate means.380 An article with a similar theme was exhibited from The Sun entitled 
‘Operation Sex Swap: MOD paying for troops’ gender surgery’.381

8.27  Within the category “trans as deviant and deserving of parody”, TMW highlighted The Sun’s 
‘Tran or Woman’ quiz, where readers were provided with a series of photographs and asked to 
guess whether the subject was transgender or not.382 It further highlighted a tendency for the 
tabloid press to use comedic, demeaning or ridiculing language in stories about transgender 
people.  Examples  were  The  Sun’s  use  of  genital-based  puns  in  the  headlines  ‘Dad  of  two 
driver  changes  gear  in  sex  swap’,383  and  The  Scottish  Sun’s  ‘Sex  swap  mechanic  goes  nuts 
at medics’384 or the use of derogatory words such as “tranny”. In respect of the Daily Mail, 
TMW noted its tendency to report on transgender people as though the category were false 
or unreal: it frequently used inverted commas around the words ‘transgender people’, and 
referred to transgender women as “men” and transgender men as “women”.385

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public8.28  The final category – the outing of transgender people – was perhaps the most disturbing, 
given the very damaging effect this can have on individuals. Helen Belcher of TMW told the 
Inquiry that The Sun’s ‘Dad of two driver changes gear in sex swap’ story was written without 
permission and without reference to the subject of the story. The photograph was similarly 
published without permission. Ms Belcher said:386

“The piece was rewritten so it looked as though the subject had colluded with the 
Sun. The first the subject knew was when the Sun published it. It caused her immense 
distress. It also caused her children huge distress, because they thought that she had 
sold her story or was behind her story in some way, and she had nothing to do with 
the story whatsoever. It is a pure expose. There is no public interest.”

8.29  Two further examples were referred to in TMW’s second submission. First, on 12 February 
2012, The Sun had revealed the story of (allegedly) the UK’s first transgender male to give 
birth.387 Faced with an unwillingness (or inability) of transgender groups to identify the man, 
The Sun chose to publish a call for the public to identify the person concerned and offered 
a reward for information. Eventually, once identified, the individual was door-stepped by a 
journalist.388 The Sun published stories revealing his identity, and other newspapers, including 
the Daily Mail, published comment pieces about the “freakish” and “revolting” thought of a 
man giving birth.389

8.30  Second, on 20 February 2012, the Daily Mail published a story about a five year old child 
who had been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder. There was perhaps a public interest 
in the story itself, but included within the story was also the child’s name, date and place 
of birth, birth certificate, photographs of the child and the name of the school and hospital 
she attended.390 It was unclear what form of consent was received to publish the story, but it 
seems inconceivable that the child’s parents would have granted consent for what followed. 
In several follow-up articles, the Daily Mail criticised the child’s “misguided” parents for their 
“nonsense” in allowing the child to be diagnosed with a disorder, criticised the school for 
profligate spending of resources to provide a gender neutral toilet in the child’s school, and 
used the child’s case (and photographs) as an example to debunk the politically correct rise 
of an “industry” which encourages trans-sexualism.391

8.31  The critical comments made in the follow-up pieces, although on occasion uninformed and 
potentially misleading, might well have been justified as fair comment on a matter of public 
interest.  However,  in  the  context,  they  were  comment  pieces  which  were  directly  related 
to an identified, photographed and vulnerable child. Each piece republished the same large 
photographs of the five year old as part of the article, and the impact of the reporting as a 
whole may well have been tremendously damaging. As TMW noted:392

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF“TMW recognises that many more children report gender variant episodes than turn 
out to be trans. However, when a child expresses a strong level of distress about their 
gender, severe psychological issues can result if left untreated. It is entirely possible 
that Z may decide as she grows older that she wishes to revert to being a boy. If that 
scenario  does  arise,  the  level  of  press  exposure  is  likely  to  make  that  decision  far 
harder to take. There is significant concern about giving someone like this so much 
exposure, especially when they are vulnerable. Paradoxically this is a concern that the 
press has also expressed, but their rush to publish seems to be paramount.”

8.32  On the basis of the evidence seen by the Inquiry, it is clear that there is a marked tendency in 
a section of the press to fail to treat members of the transgender and intersex communities 
with sufficient dignity and respect; and in instances where individuals are identified either 
expressly or by necessary implication perpetrate breaches of clause 12 of the Code. Parts of 
the tabloid press continue to seek to ‘out’ transgender people notwithstanding its prohibition 
in  the  Editors’  Code.  And  parts  of  the  tabloid  press  continue  to  refer  to  the  transgender 
community in derogatory terms, holding transgender people up for ridicule, or denying the 
legitimacy of their condition. Although the Inquiry heard evidence that parts of the tabloid 
press had “raised [its] game in terms of transgender reporting”,393 the examples provided by 
TMW of stories from the last year demonstrate that the game needs to be raised significantly 
higher.

F

8.33  The press has shown itself quite capable of doing so: 30 years ago, an Inquiry into the culture 
practices and ethics of the press was likely to have seen a deluge of complaints relating to the 
representation of homosexuals in the press.394 The fact that only a very few such complaints 
were received by this Inquiry may reflect the press’s ability to put its own house in order. 
Alternatively, it may simply reflect that society had changed and the press has been forced 
to keep up.

Ethnic minorities, immigrants and asylum seekers

8.34 

It  seems  that  a  raising  of  the  game  is  also  required  in  relation  to  the  representation  of 
some ethnic minorities, immigrants and asylum seekers. The Joint Council for the Welfare 
of Immigrants drew the Inquiry’s attention to a recent report from the Council of Europe’s 
Commission on Racism and Intolerance, which stated:395

“[ECRI]  notes  with  concern  that  Muslims,  migrants  and  asylum  seekers  Gypsies/
Travellers are regularly presented in a negative light in the mainstream media, and 
in particular the tabloid press, where they are frequently portrayed, for example, as 
being  by  definition  associated  with  terrorism,  sponging  off  British  society,  making 
bogus claims for protection or being troublemakers. ECRI is concerned... [about] the 
racist and xenophobic messages themselves that are thus propagated in the media...”

8.35  This  conclusion,  and  in  particular,  the  identification  of  Muslims,  migrants,  asylum  seekers 
and gypsies/travellers as the targets of press hostility and/or xenophobia in the press, was 
supported by the evidence seen by the Inquiry.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public8.36 

In relation to alleged discrimination of Muslims, the Muslim advocacy group ENGAGE shared 
its concern that the last decade had seen, within parts of the tabloid press, an increase in 
Islamophobic and discriminatory coverage of Muslim issues. It drew the Inquiry’s attention 
to numerous headlines referring to Muslims, or Muslim practices, in alarmist and sensational 
terms. It noted, amongst others, the following headlines, which appeared to have little factual 
basis but which may have contributed to a negative perception of Muslims in the UK: ‘Muslim 
Schools Ban Our Culture’; ‘BBC Puts Muslims Before You!’; ‘Christmas is Banned: It Offends 
Muslims’; ‘Brit Kids Forced to Eat Halal School Dinners!’; ‘Muslims Tell Us How To Run Our 
Schools’.396

8.37  The organisation submitted to the Inquiry a summary of some of its complaints to the PCC 
since December 2007 relating to inflammatory and inaccurate reporting. The articles of which 
Engage had complained included:

(a) 

a Daily Star article entitled ‘Poppies banned in Terror Hotspots’, which suggested that 
a ban on the sale of Remembrance Day poppies had been imposed in certain Muslim 
populated areas, where no such ban existed.397

(b)  A  Daily  Star  article  entitled  ‘Muslim  only  public  loos’,  which  suggested  that  a  local 
authority planned to build new public toilets, with taxpayer money, for the exclusive 
use of Muslims, when this was a simple fiction.398

(c)  A Daily Express article entitled ‘Muslim plot to kill the pope’, which reported on a non-

existent plot.399

(d)  A Daily Mail article entitled ‘Cafe wins fight to fry bacon after Muslim complaints’ which 
implied that complaints to a local authority which had sparked enforcement action by 
planning officers had been made by Muslims, when that was not the case.400

8.38  ENGAGE also drew the Inquiry’s attention to complaints made by others to the PCC in relation 
to articles alleged to be discriminatory or inaccurate in their reporting of Muslim issues. Those 
complaints included:

(a)  A complaint from ummah.com in relation to an article in The Sun alleging a Muslim 
plot to kill prominent British Jews. The basis of the article was an apparently extremist 
posting  on  the  ummah.com  website.  Investigations  revealed  that  the  posting  had 
in fact been fabricated by The Sun’s “anti-terror expert” and the story had no basis 
whatsoever.401

(b)  A complaint from the Ummah Welfare Trust, an international relief and development 
charity, in relation to a Daily Express article alleging connections between the charity and 
terrorist organisations on the UN’s proscribed list. There were no such connections.402

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF8.39  ENGAGE’s representative, Inayat Bunglawala, was of the view that the articles complained of 
had the cumulative effect of increasing prejudice against Muslims. However, he went further: 
his view was that the headlines identified, and the decisions to place those articles on the 
front page of the newspapers, were deliberate, and were intended deliberately to increase 
such prejudice.403 He indicated that many of the headlines had been used by the far right to 
further its racist propaganda.404

8.40  The Daily Telegraph’s Peter Oborne shared some of these concerns. His pamphlet ‘Muslims 
Under Siege’ was instructive.405 It recalled a story published in The Sun with the headline 
‘Brave Heroes Hounded Out’ which told how “Muslim yobs” had wrecked a house to prevent 
British soldiers returning from Afghanistan from moving in. In his pamphlet, Mr Oborne noted 
that millions of Sun readers reading the article would have felt justified anger and contempt 
for “the violent and treacherous Muslims  who had carried out such a disloyal  act against 
brave British soldiers. But there was one very big problem with the Sun story… there was no 
Muslim involvement of any kind.” The pamphlet continued:406

“What  the  Sun  had  done  was  to  take  a  local  story  about  a  piece  of  vandalism, 
probably caused by local snobbery about the presence of soldiers – and convert it 
into another kind of story altogether about evil Muslims. This case is far from unique. 
As we discovered while researching this pamphlet, is in fact typical of reporting of the 
Muslim communities across large parts of the mainstream British media.”

F

8.41  Suleman Nagdi MBE, representing the Federation of Muslim Organisations, considered that 
“certain tabloid papers have reported on issues concerning Muslims with a lack of accountability 
which has resulted in a climate of hostility in both the reporters and the readership”.407 He 
thought that some articles were explicitly discriminatory, but drew the Inquiry’s attention 
to the conclusions of a study published by Paul Baker of Lancaster University entitled ‘The 
Representation of Muslims in the British Press 1998-2009. This concluded:408

“More  common  than  the  expressly  negative  representation  of  Muslims,  was  a 
more  subtle  set  of  implicitly  negative  representations,  with  Muslims  often  being 
“collectivised”  via  homogenising  terms  like  “Muslim  world”  and  written  about 
predominantly in contexts to do with conflict, terrorism and extremism.”

8.42  Other academic research seen by the Inquiry supports that view. In its briefing note for the All 
Party Parliamentary Group on Islamophobia, ENGAGE drew attention to a report by the Cardiff 
School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies which had reviewed the representation of 
British Muslims in the press between 2000 – 2008.409 That report concluded:410

“In sum, we found that the bulk of coverage of British Muslims – around two thirds 
– focuses on Muslims as a threat (in relation to terrorism), a problem (in terms of 
differences in values) or both (Muslim extremism in general).

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicThe  language  used  about  British  Muslims  reflects  the  negative  or  problematic 
contexts in which they tend to appear. Four of the five most common discourses used 
about Muslims in the British press associate Islam/Muslims with threats, problems 
or in opposition to dominant British values. So, for example, the idea that Islam is 
dangerous, backward or irrational is present in 26% of stories. By contrast, only 2% 
of stories contained the proposition that Muslims supported dominant moral values.
Similarly, we found that the most common nouns used in relation to British Muslims 
were terrorist, extremist, Islamist, suicide bomber and militant, with very few positive 
nouns  (such  as  ‘scholar’)  used.  The  most  common  adjectives  used  were  radical, 
fanatical,  fundamentalist,  extremist  and  militant.  Indeed,  references  to  radical 
Muslims outnumber references to moderate Muslims by 17 to one.”

8.43  Mr Peppiatt suggested that this type of unbalanced reporting was motivated by circulation. 
One of the keys reasons he cited for resigning from the Daily Star was what he perceived 
as its Islamophobic agenda. He said that he experienced a top down pressure to unearth 
stories which fit within what was described as the Daily Star’s “narrative” (“immigrants are 
taking over, Muslims are a threat to security”); the factual basis for a story was less important 
than that narrative. Mr Peppiatt said he was personally responsible for writing the fictional 
“Muslim only public loos” story. Although the newspaper was aware that the story was not 
true, an editorial decision was taken to publish anyway. Similarly, Mr Peppiatt described an 
article  he  wrote  on  plans  to  require  Sikhs  to  remove  their  turbans  at  airport  security,  for 
fear that Islamic terrorists might disguise themselves as Sikhs. There was no factual basis for 
that story either, but Mr Peppiatt invented quotes from a “security source” to lend an air of 
credibility.411

8.44  The overall picture is more nuanced than witnesses such as Mr Peppiatt have been prepared to 
accept. The Daily Star submitted a lever arch file containing a bundle of what it described were 
‘pro-Muslim’ articles; although I would not necessarily agree with that precise designation, 
the  broad  sentiment  is  wholly  accurate.  Here, a  quantitative  assessment  is  inappropriate; 
the Inquiry could not begin to reach judgments as to the proportion of ‘pro-Muslim’ against 
‘anti-Muslim’ pieces.

8.45 

In any event, that would be to miss the point. It is not as if the ‘pro’ articles somehow cancel 
out or fall to be weighed in the balance against the ‘anti’: the real point is whether articles 
unfairly representing Muslims in a negative light are appropriate in a mature democracy which 
respects both freedom of expression and the right of individuals not to face discrimination. 
The evidence demonstrates that sections of the press betray a tendency, which is far from 
being  universal  or  even  preponderant,  to  portray  Muslims  in  a  negative  light.  As  with 
the  case  of  discrimination  against  women  discussed  above,  issues  arise  in  relation  to  the 
interpretation and application of clause 12 of the Editors’ Code, and the arguable need to 
identify an individual target of discrimination, but the key point which falls to be made in the 
present context is the need for a regulator with the ability and power to grapple with these 
issues and set appropriate standards.

8.46  The  tendency  identified  in  the  preceding  paragraph  is  not  limited  to  the  representation 
of  Muslims  and  applies  in  a  similar  way  to  some  other  minority  ethnic  groups.  The  Joint 
Council on the Welfare of Immigrants, the Migrant and Refugee Communities Forum, and 
the Federation of Poles in Great Britain gave evidence that supported and complemented 
each other. Together, their evidence suggested that the approach of parts of the press to

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFmigrants and asylum seekers was one of advocacy rather than reporting: some newspapers 
expressed a consistently clear view on the harm caused by migrants and/or asylum seekers 
(often conflating the two) and ensured that any coverage of the issue fit within that narrative.

8.47 

It is unquestionably right that, in relation to inherently political questions like immigration 
and asylum, editors and journalists are entitled to express their strongly held views in their 
newspapers. However, the concerns raised by the various witnesses were not limited to the 
expression of views, but included allegations of wilful blindness to the (lack of) truth of stories 
which fit with a newspaper’s adopted viewpoint. Stories which are factually incorrect clearly 
raise issues under clause 1 of the Code regardless of clause 12. The organisations drew the 
Inquiry’s attention to the follow as examples:

(a) 

(b) 

The Sun’s story headlined “Swan Bake”, which alleged that gangs of Eastern European 
asylum  seekers  were  killing  and  eating  swans  from  ponds  and  lakes  in  London. 
Unidentified people were cited as witnesses to the phenomenon, but it seemed there 
was  no  basis  to  the  story:  the  Sun  was  unable  to  defend  the  article  against  a  PCC 
complaint.412

The Daily Star’s article headlined “Asylum seekers eat our donkeys.” The story told of the 
disappearance of nine donkeys from Greenwich Royal Park. The police were reported as 
having no idea what had happened to the donkeys but, in a piece of total speculation, 
the story went on to claim that donkey meat was a speciality in Somalia and Eastern 
Europe, that there were “large numbers of Somalian asylum-seekers” in the area and 
some Albanians nearby, and concluded that asylum seekers had eaten the donkeys.413

(c) 

The Daily Mail’s erroneous report that a judge had allowed an immigrant to remain in 
the UK because “the right to family life” protected his relationship with his cat.414

8.48 

It is one thing for a newspaper to take the view that immigration should be reduced, or that 
the asylum and/or human rights system should be reformed, and to report on true stories 
which support those political views. It is another thing to misreport stories either wilfully 
or reckless as to their truth or accuracy, in order to ensure that they support those political 
views. And it does appear that certain parts of the press do, on occasion, prioritise the political 
stance of the title over the accuracy of the story. Ms Stanistreet, on behalf of the NUJ, gave 
evidence as follows:415

“Journalists that I spoke to in the course of collating this testimony painted a disturbing 
picture of the nature of the day to day sentiments expressed by senior editorial staff- 
such  comments  give  an  insight  into  the  approach  taken  on  coverage  of  race  and 
ethnicity. These included a reporter being told by the news editor to “write a story 
about  Britain  being  flooded  by  asylum-seeking  bummers”;  instructions  to  “make 
stories as right wing as you can”; a reporter being told to go out and find Muslim 
women to photograph with the instruction: “Just fucking do it. Wrap yourself around 
a group of women in burkas for a photo”.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public8.49  Although the weight to be given to this anonymous evidence is necessarily limited, it coheres 
with the evidence given by Mr Peppiatt and Mr Oborne, and is consistent with the kinds of 
complaints made by the Joint Council on the Welfare of Immigrants, the Migrant and Refugee 
Communities Forum, the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, ENGAGE and Mr Nagdi. That 
evidence suggested that, in relation to reporting on Muslims, immigrants and asylum seekers, 
there was a tendency for some titles to adopt a sensationalist mode of reporting intended to 
support a world-view rather than to report a story. The evidence given by the Irish Traveller 
Movement in Britain suggested a similar approach to gypsy and traveller issues.416

8.50 

It is important to reiterate that the evidence was not all bad: there were many examples of 
titles with responsible and positive reporting on these issues, and even within the section 
of the press identified for criticism, there was evidence showing a complicated picture. For 
example, although the Daily Mail has been criticised for its reporting of some minority issues, 
its  Stephen  Lawrence  campaign  demonstrated  a  newspaper  committed  to  tackling  and 
condemning racism.

8.51  Nonetheless,  when  assessed  as  a  whole,  the  evidence  of  discriminatory,  sensational  or 
unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers, is 
concerning. The press can have significant influence over community relations and the way in 
which parts of society perceive other parts. While newspapers are entitled to express strong 
views on minority issues, immigration and asylum, it is important that stories on those issues 
are accurate, and are not calculated to exacerbate community divisions or increase resentment. 
Although the majority of the press appear to discharge this responsibility with care, there are 
enough examples of careless or reckless reporting to conclude that discriminatory, sensational 
or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers is 
a feature of journalistic practice in parts of the press, rather than an aberration.

8.52  Overall,  the  evidence  in  relation  to  the  representation  of  women  and  minorities  suggests 
that there has been a significant tendency within the press which leads to the publication of 
prejudicial or pejorative references to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or physical or 
mental illness or disability. Whether these publications have also amounted to breaches of 
the Editors’ Code in every case is debatable, but in the ultimate analysis is little to the point. 
That failure has, in the main, been limited to a section of the press and may well stem from an 
undue focus on seeking to reflect the views (even if unsuccessfully) of a particular readership. 
A new regulator will need to address these issues as a matter of priority, the first steps being 
to amend practice and the Code to permit third party complaints.

inaccuracy
It is not by accident that the Editors’ Code begins with a requirement for accuracy:417 it is 
the foundation stone on which journalism depends. For that reason, the extensive evidence 
heard by the Inquiry of problems with basic accuracy in parts of the press caused significant 
concern. In what follows, that evidence is considered in five parts. These are:

(a) 

evidence of deliberate invention and fabrication of stories by sections of the press, and/
or a failure to check the truth of invented stories;

Traveller-Movement-April-20121.pdf
417 Clause 1(i) of the PCC Code requires the press to take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted 
information, including pictures.

(b)

(e) 

evidence of deliberately misleading headlines;
evidence of careless or reckless inaccuracy in particular when reporting fast moving 
and high profile stories;
evidence of a tendency for sections of the press to report political and social issues 
inaccurately in order to fit into the worldview of the title; and
evidence that scientific stories are reported poorly and often inaccurately by much of 
the press.

It  is  important  to  note  that  it  is  inevitable  that  inaccuracies  will  appear  in  newspapers, 
given the quantity of stories published and the speed at which they need to be written. It 
is also inevitable that some stories will be defamatory. But what is not inevitable is that the 
inaccuracies or defamations will be deliberate or the result of reckless or careless journalism. 
The  Inquiry  heard  many  examples  of  inaccuracies  in  the  press,  and  sometimes  damaging 
inaccuracies  which  had  led  to  successful  defamation  claims  and  serious  criticism  of  the 
newspapers involved.418 Although consideration was given to basing criticisms in this Report 
upon some of those examples, I decided that it would be unjustified to do so. Unless the 
examples of inaccuracy manifestly fell into the categories of deliberate, reckless or careless 
inaccuracy, they have not been included in what follows.

The Inquiry has been told by a number of witnesses that the majority of inaccuracy complaints 
to the PCC emanate from the regional press. As has been explained elsewhere, that section 
of the press has been expressly excluded from the generic criticisms which form this lengthy 
Chapter of the Report. But there is no inconsistency here: the point has already been made 
that mistakes are inevitable in any industry which depends on the judgments of human beings, 
and the problems deriving from the regional press are not in my view cultural or systemic. No 
one has suggested to the Inquiry that they are – indeed, many have suggested affirmatively 
that they are not – and on the available evidence I am happy to endorse that conclusion.

Fabrication or deliberate embellishment of stories
The  Inquiry  heard  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude  that  some  sections  of  the  press  have 
deliberately  invented  stories  with  no  factual  basis  in  order  to  satisfy  the  demands  of  a 
readership. Mr Peppiatt spoke of his experience while a journalist at the Daily Star of a top-
down pressure to fabricate stories. As noted above, he gave numerous examples of Daily Star 
stories about celebrities and about Muslim issues that were published despite the knowledge 
that they were untrue.419 In his resignation letter, he had written:420

“Daily Star favourite Kelly Brook recently said in an interview: “I do Google myself. 
Not that often, though, and the stories are always rubbish. “There was a story that 
I’d seen a hypnotherapist to help me cut down on the time I take to get ready to go 
out. Where do they get it from?”

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicMaybe I should answer that one. I made it up. Not that it was my choice; I was told 
to. At 6pm and staring at a blank page I simply plucked it from my arse. Not that it 
was all bad. I pocketed a £150 bonus. You may have read some of my other earth-
shattering exclusives.
‘Michael Jackson to attend Jade Goody’s funeral’. (He didn’t.) ‘Robbie pops ‘pill at 
heroes concert’. (He didn’t either.) ‘Matt Lucas on suicide watch’. (He wasn’t.) ‘Jordan 
turns to Buddha.’ (She might have, but I doubt it.)”

9.5 

In his evidence to the Inquiry he confirmed his view that much of tabloid journalism was “not 
a  truth  seeking  enterprise”,  but  was  instead  “ideologically  driven  and…  impact-driven.”421 
In  that  context,  fictional  stories  were  not  only  relatively  commonplace,  but  were  actively 
encouraged by senior staff within the title. In oral evidence Mr Peppiatt gave further examples 
of fictional stories published by the Daily Star as follows:422

““Chile  mine  to  open  as  theme park”, “Angelina  Jolie  to  play  Susan  Boyle  in  film”, 
“Bubbles to give evidence at Jacko trial” – that’s his monkey – “Jade’s back in Big 
Brother” – she was dead at the time. Obviously we have the likes of “Maddie’s body 
stored in freezer”, which we’ve heard already. “Grand Theft Auto Rothbury” – that 
was the Raoul Moat killing. There was going to be a computer game based around it. 
Completely untrue. “Brittany Murphy killed by swine flu” – wasn’t the case. “Macca 
versus Mucka on ice”, which was Paul McCartney and his ex-wife were apparently 
going to showdown on Dancing on Ice. Never transpired. Then we have the likes of 
“Muslim-only public loos”, which in my letter I raise. Completely untrue as well.”

9.6 

Although Mr Peppiatt’s evidence was challenged by the Daily Star and a number of witnesses 
said that they did not recognise what he had described, it was consistent with the anonymous 
evidence reported by Steve Turner of the British Association of Journalists: he had received 
complaints from a number of other journalists who had reported similar editorial pressure to 
fabricate stories, sometimes under threat of dismissal.423 The evidence of Sharon Marshall is 
consistent with that of Mr Peppiatt. Not only did she suggest that quotations were routinely 
made up but also that it was common practice in some of the papers on which she worked 
for journalists to fabricate quotations to push a particular line with regard to a story and then 
find a willing contact to ‘own’ the quote. She provides the specific example of the model 
and TV presenter, Abi Titmuss, who was one of a number of celebrities called to see if they 
would ‘own’ a quotation that had been written to push a particular point of view or story.424 
Further, a willingness by parts of the press to fabricate in order to tell an ‘impactful’ story was 
also evidenced by Piers Morgan’s admission to have altered a photograph digitally to show 
Princess Diana and Dodi al-Fayed kissing, when the original showed nothing of the sort.425

9.7 

The Inquiry heard evidence from a number of witnesses who had been victims of fabricated 
stories. Mr Grant exhibited an article in the Sunday Express, apparently written by Mr Grant 
himself. In fact, it was entirely fabricated: Mr Grant had not only not written the article, but

he had given no interview to the Sunday Express.426 In a similar example, Hello! Magazine 
published  an  “exclusive”  interview  with  Ms  Rowling,  when  no  such  interview  had  been 
given and when in fact Ms Rowling had expressly refused to give an interview to them.427 
Unsurprisingly, in each example the relevant title was forced to apologise in open court.

9.8  Mr Campbell complained of numerous fabricated stories about him and about matters in 

Government generally. In respect of one particular example he said:428

“I  can  recall  one  weekend  being  interrupted  by  persistent  calls  from  reporters 
following up a story in the Sunday Express that I was leaving Downing Street to take 
up  a  position  at  Manchester  United.  This  was  based  on  so-called  quotes  from  so-
called friends and colleagues. I called the newspaper – which had not put the story 
to me in advance – to complain and to issue a strong denial. I said there was no truth 
in it whatsoever. “I know,’ came the response. ’But it’s a good story.’ …They knew the 
story was untrue, so did not put it to me because a denial would weaken it”

9.9 

The  erroneous  report  in  the  Mail  Online  of  the  Amanda  Knox  guilty  verdict  is  a  different 
example. Prior to the verdict being read out, the Mail had prepared two “set and hold” versions 
of a story, to prepare for both a guilty and not guilty verdict; that much is not surprising. 
Through human error, the guilty verdict story was published online. That error was also made 
by The Sun online and the Guardian online and, again, such error is, at times, unavoidable. 
The Mail’s story, however, was unique in that it described, in detail, events that simply did not 
happen. Full Fact, an organisation dedicated to monitoring accuracy in the press, explained 
to the Inquiry:429

“Amanda Knox was found not guilty of murder. Before that was announced, though, 
a verdict of guilty was given in relation to a charge of slander. As soon as the first 
guilty was pronounced, the Daily Mail published an online article headlined: “Guilty: 
Amanda Knox looks stunned as appeal against murder conviction is rejected.” The 
first part was mistaken; the second part was fiction.
The fiction continued in the text, including: “As Knox realized the enormity of what 
Judge Hellman was saying she sank into her chair sobbing uncontrollably while her 
family and friends hugged each other in tears” and “Prosecutors were delighted with 
the  verdict  and  said  that  ’justice  has  been  done’  although  they  said  on  a  ’human 
factor it was sad two young people would be spending years in jail’.”

9.10  The Mail’s explanation given by counsel during the course of the Inquiry was that that the 
story  was  not  fabricated;  it  claimed  to  have  obtained  alternative  quotes  from  the  Italian 
prosecutors in advance to cover guilty or not guilty verdicts. Whether prosecutors provided 
‘quotes for publication’ in advance or not, there can be no argument that the description 
of events in the courtroom when the guilty verdict was read out was anything other than 
fictitious licence. True it is that the fabrication only added colour and emotion to the story, 
but the example raises questions of how widespread that practice is, and how frequently the 
‘adding of colour’ goes unnoticed.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public9.11  Mr Campbell, along with Mr Grant and others, expressed their concerns of a growing reliance, 
within parts of the press, on anonymous quotes, many of which they believed to be entirely 
fabricated.430 That there has been regular misuse of attribution to anonymous sources seems 
clear in light of the phone hacking revelations. Many of the stories published by the NoTW, 
now known to be based on phone hacking, were attributed to anonymous sources such as 
“friends” or “pals” or “sources”. Mr Peppiatt confirmed that in his experience, many quotes 
attributed to “a source”, “a friend”, “a pal” were indeed invented. He gave examples of quotes 
he had invented to support fictional stories about Katie Price, and said:431

“Although unnamed sources are a valuable journalistic tool to protect sources, often 
in my experience of tabloids they are simply made up by the reporter to increase the 
word count and add a veneer of legitimacy to something that is speculation, at best.”

9.12  There is no easy-fix for this problem. The anonymity of confidential sources is a vital aspect of 
journalism and must be protected. But the use of anonymous sources can lead to an inability 
to assess whether the source is reliable, or even exists. Solicitor Magnus Boyd raised this 
concern in relation to a Daily Mail story about one of his clients, the Tamil hunger striker 
Parameswaran Subramanyam. The Mail’s story alleged that Mr Subramanyam had sustained 
himself  with  McDonalds  hamburgers  during  his  hunger  strike  and  quoted  an  anonymous 
‘police  insider’  and  ‘a  source’  saying  that  police  surveillance  cameras  had  captured  him 
eating  the  hamburgers.  The  story,  it  transpired,  was  entirely  untrue:  there  was  no  police 
surveillance, there was no consumption of hamburgers and the Mail paid substantial damages 
for defamation.432 In relation to the police sources quoted in the article, Mr Boyd noted:433

“As a matter of logic there are only two possibilities which are either that:

i  a police source simply made up these allegations and communicated them to 

The Daily Mail; or

ii  The Daily Mail made up the police sources.”

9.13  To that, one might add a third possibility, that there was a source, but it was not a ‘police 
insider’, as claimed, and that description of the source was given to lend greater credibility 
to the story. The reality is that it is impossible to know which of those three possibilities is 
correct. The journalist responsible, Stephen Wright, insisted that there was a source for each 
of the quotations in the article,434 but given the evidence seen by the Inquiry of invented 
sources and fabricated quotations, it is simply a question of having to be prepared to take his 
word for it.435

9.14  The  very  nature  of  this  problem  renders  it  close  to  impossible  to  express  any  generic 
conclusions  about  it;  or,  more  precisely,  conclusions  based  on  evidence  as  opposed  to 
informed speculation. There will be many instances where for very good reason a journalist

to do so would break a confidence. But in many other instances, it is inevitable that there 
should be real concern that the invocation of an anonymous or confidential source is likely 
to be a camouflage for a source who does not exist, or one who is known or suspected to be 
unreliable, or one in respect of whom inadequate enquiry is made by the journalist.

9.15  An informed member of the public may harbour his or her suspicions or concerns about these 
matters, but will never know the true position if the journalist does not choose to disclose the 
very information which would enable a judgment to be made about it. The very substantial 
privileges accorded to journalists in this regard by the European Convention and the common 
law are such that immense trust is being placed on the press to deploy their sources in the 
public interest rather than against it.

9.16  There  is  a  powerful  public  interest  in  readers  being  able  to  assess  for  themselves  the 
evidence  base  for  any  assertion  of  fact  or  expression  of  opinion  in  a  newspaper.  Overall, 
the identification of the source or sources would go a long way to meeting what Professor 
Baroness O’Neill has described as the public interest in ‘assessibility’; and that should be the 
default position, only to be displaced if the public interest in confidentiality requires it.

9.17 

It is likely, of course, that many of the fabricated stories published by parts of the press do 
come from genuine sources, but there is evidence that, in certain circumstances and at certain 
titles, checking the facts provided by a source is limited (if not slapdash) at best. Mr Peppiatt’s 
view was that some newspapers adopted a cavalier approach to checking facts provided by a 
source where the risk of litigation was assessed to be low, particularly in celebrity stories that 
were not damaging to reputations.436

F

9.18  Examples of that approach to celebrity reporting were provided by Mr Atkins, who had sold 
numerous fictional stories to newspapers during the making of his documentary ‘Starsuckers’. 
The stories, published by various tabloid newspapers despite the fact that the core of each 
story was fabricated, included: Avril Lavigne falling asleep and snoring in a nightclub; Amy 
Winehouse  setting  her  hair  on  fire  at  a  party;  Guy  Ritchie  injuring  himself  while  juggling 
cutlery  in  a  restaurant;  Pixie  Geldof  padding  her  bra  out  with  sweets;  and  Sarah  Harding 
owning a number of books on quantum physics.437

9.19  Two aspects of the evidence in relation to the stories stood out. First, two newspapers added 
their own fabrications to the already fabricated stories: in the Amy Winehouse story, the Daily 
Star added its own twist that “a friend was called in and ended up punching Flamey Amy’s 
head to put out the blaze”; in the Sarah Harding story, The Sun appeared to have invented a 
quote from a source that “there’s a lot more going on under that blonde barnet than Sarah’s 
given credit for. She’s a smart cookie and does read an awful lot.”438

9.20  Second, when The Sun’s Gordon Smart gave evidence in relation to two of the stories published 
by The Sun (the Guy Ritchie and Sarah Harding stories) he appeared unwilling to accept that 
The Sun had, in fact, published fiction. He seemed to suggest that the stories, invented by 
Mr Atkins in key respects, might have coincidentally been true. In addition, he seemed not to 
think that there was anything wrong with publishing fiction in a newspaper which purported

9.22 

to be publishing fact. He appeared to suggest that it did not matter because the stories were 
“insignificant” and “trivial”.439 Perhaps that explains why the story about Ms Harding remains 
on The Sun’s website notwithstanding the clear evidence that it was fictional.440

It is of course correct that the stories were insignificant and were trivial. But that does not 
change the fact that they were fictional, while purporting to be true. Furthermore, although 
newspaper readers will accept that not every story they read is accurate (because mistakes 
can be made), that is not the same as saying that they would be as sanguine about stories 
that were known by those responsible for writing and publishing them to have been made up 
or deliberately exaggerated.

In addition to the fact that fictional stories undermine the trust on which newspapers depend, 
part of their problem is that they very quickly become “popular truth” by virtue of repetition 
in other newspapers, blogs and websites. Ms Church gave an example of this. The People 
published an entirely fictional story about Ms Church drunkenly proposing marriage to her 
boyfriend while singing karaoke in a pub. Allegedly the story was provided to the People by 
a source, but the People chose to rely on that source alone without putting the story directly 
to Ms Church or her representatives441 and without even the most basic fact checking. In fact, 
Ms Church was, at the relevant time, performing in a completely different town with a large 
public audience and there was not even karaoke at the pub she was reported to have been 
in. Nonetheless, once published, the story was republished and rehashed in more than 70 
outlets internationally and became “true” in the public mind at least.442

9.23  Mr Peppiatt described how an inaccurate article in one title can spread virally through others. 
In  his  experience  fact  checking  was  rarely  carried  out  in  relation  to  stories  published  in 
“reputable” titles or news agencies. In his written evidence he wrote:443

“The majority of stories appearing in the Daily Star are sourced from the news wires 
or plagiarised from other newspapers, in particular the Daily Mail, which is such a 
heavy influence that for the most part it dictated the Daily Star’s news agendA.  In 
addition to the major news agencies such as Reuters, PA and Associated Press there 
are  dozens  of  local  agencies  dotted  around  the  country  supplying  content  to  the 
national press. Some of this content is lifted from local newspapers, or sourced from 
agency reporters’ own contacts… One obvious consequence of reporters cannibalising 
the work of other journalists is that the former is often wholly unaware of the veracity 
of their information. Sometimes the maxim that a story is “too good to check” comes 
into play, and in this manner falsehoods can easily become propagated across the 
media.”

9.24  He developed this in oral evidence, saying:444

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF“So as a journalist, you know, if I see a Daily Mail story I’ve been given to rewrite in 
Daily Star style, you know, for me to then research where they’ve got their information, 
and if I find out that in fact that information has been distorted or is inaccurate, for 
me to then approach the news desk and say, “Actually, I’ve found out this Daily Mail 
story is just not standing up”, you’d be sort of kicked back to your seat fairly robustly. 
You know, that’s not the point. This is, you know: the Daily Mail said it; write it.”

9.25  Again,  I  recognise  that  much  of  what  Mr  Peppiatt  said  was  challenged  and  said  to  be 
unrecognisable. It is undeniable, however, that many of the allegations that he made have 
been exemplified in other evidence provided to the Inquiry.

Deliberately misleading headlines

9.26  A  particular  problem  of  inaccuracy  identified  in  the  evidence  was  the  use  of  misleading 
headlines  that  misrepresented  the  content  of  the  actual  story.  Mr  Peppiatt  described  his 
experience at the Daily Star:445

F

“Another ethically dubious technique used by the Daily Star (and other tabloids, if 
not to the same ridiculous degree) is the overplayed headlines that misrepresent the 
truth of the story beyond. It is such an endemic problem at the Daily Star that most 
days a comparison of the front page with the story inside is bordering on the comedic. 
One recent example claimed TV KING COWELL IS ’DEAD’. The story inside was about 
him leaving X Factor. This behaviour is purely a cynical ploy to encourage consumers 
to purchase the Daily Star over rivals. Often lacking a real scoop to encourage this, 
they simply pretend to have one. It’s a con, plain and simple. The Daily Express is no 
better at this. Particularly distasteful are their front page claims of “miracle cures” 
for cancer/Alzheimer’s/Parkinson’s, which upon closer analysis are simply initial trials 
on  mice,  with  many  years  of  research  ahead  before  they  can  even  be  considered 
medically sound. This type of misleading sensationalism deliberately plays on offering 
false hope to people whose lives have been affected by such illnesses, all in order to 
sell their papers”

9.27 

In addition to the “Telly King Cowell is Dead” story, the Inquiry saw further examples from 
the Daily Star. One story headed “Terror As Plane Hits Ash Cloud” was accompanied by an 
image of  a  burning  jumbo  jet.  The  story was  in  fact  about  a  television  programme which 
had simulated what might happen if a plane flew into a volcanic ash cloud, but the headline 
and  picture  were  so  alarming  that  copies  of  that  edition  of  the  Daily  Star  were  removed 
from airports.446 Another example was an article headed, “English Defence League to become 
political party”. The story in fact included an interview with the leader of the EDL who was 
quoted as “not ruling out” becoming a political party, but expressed a clear preference not 
to do so.447

9.28  Other newspapers were also guilty of misleading headlines. The Daily Express headlined a 
report of a poll showing that 28 per cent of people supported quitting the EU with the headline 
“75 per cent say quit the EU now!” Similarly, the Mail on Sunday published an article under 
the headline “BBC turns its back on Year of Our Lord: 2,000 years of Christianity jettisoned

had in fact made no decision on the use of the terms BC, AD, BCE and CE, and had issued no 
guidelines on the matter.448 449

9.29  Evidence  of  the  embellishment  of  headlines  was  not  limited  to  the  tabloid  press:  some 
broadsheets and celebrity magazines were shown to have adopted the practice as well. From 
the broadsheets, the Inquiry was shown a Daily Telegraph headline “Children to be banned 
from blowing up balloons, under EU safety rules”. Notwithstanding the headline, the article 
reported that there was to be no ban on balloons, merely the introduction of a requirement 
for balloons to carry a warning.450

9.30 

In relation to celebrity magazines, the Inquiry was shown a ruling from the PCC in 2008 which 
highlighted the issue and provided the following summary:451

“Readers Misled by Front Page Teasers
The  Commission  has  recently  resolved  a  number  of  separate  complaints  from 
concerned  readers  complaining  that  magazine  covers  have  promised  content  that 
does not correspond to the inside articles.
There was the cover of Reveal magazine suggesting that an article contained comments 
from Victoria Beckham about her fitness regime. The story actually contained quotes 
from Melanie Brown, who had briefly referred to Mrs Beckham. In order to resolve 
the complaint, the editor telephoned the complainant, apologising for the confusion 
and offering her a subscription.
Look magazine provoked a complaint about a front-cover image of Jennifer Anniston 
with the caption ‘I’m having a baby!”. The subsequent article contained the claims that 
Ms Aniston was thinking about – rather than confirmation that she was – having a 
baby with her partner. The editor apologised to the complainant, undertaking to bear 
her comments in mind for future reference, and refunded the cost of the magazine.
OK Magazine ran a front-page headline referring to the “Star-studded wedding” of “Wayne 
and Coleen”. Inside, there was just a full page advertisement for the wedding which was 
to be covered in the following week’s edition. The magazine indicated that it had not 
intended to mislead readers, and offered the complainant a six-month subscription.
This issue does not only relate to celebrity articles. A problem occurred with Love It 
magazine,  which  used  the  following  front-page  headline  to  summarise  an  article: 
“Locked up by my hubby and forced to eat”. The husband complained, making clear 
that  his  wife  was  sectioned  under  the  Mental  Health  Act  via  a  process  that  was 
controlled by a consultant, a GP and other medical staff. The magazine settled the 
complaint, including by apologising to the complainant.
Clearly, there is growing concern about the use of material on front covers. Magazine 
editors should be aware of this issue and act to ensure that readers are not misled by 
headline references to inside articles. The Commission may be asked to adjudicate on 
the matter, where it would be asked to consider whether the brief reference on the 
cover is justified by the content of the story itself.”

681

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF9.31  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  PCC  issued  this  warning  in  2008,  the  Inquiry  heard 
evidence of a continuing problem. In 2010, OK! Magazine advertised an “exclusive” interview 
with Ms Miller on its website, despite the fact that there was no exclusive interview in the 
magazine. Further, during the Inquiry, OK! Magazine published a teaser entitled, “Catherine’s 
royal birthday, the intimate party, gifts, star guests and delicious menu” despite the fact that 
inside the magazine there was no information on the gifts, guests or menu at the party.452

9.32 

It cannot be the case that the majority of the misleading headlines and teasers identified during 
the course of the Inquiry were accidental. Although there was clear evidence (emphasised by 
journalists whose stories were criticised because of the headline) that headline writers were 
generally  not  the  journalists  who  wrote  the  stories,  those  sub-editors  or  headline  writers 
must have read the articles or piece in question before composing their headlines. And they 
must have written the headlines in the knowledge, first, that they did not fully reflect the 
contents of the article or magazine and, second, that if the rebuttal which undermined the 
headline was included in the piece, it was almost inevitably buried at the end.

9.33  The Daily Star’s editor Dawn Neesom agreed that the Daily Star’s headlines were intended 
to create as much impact as possible in order that the person passing the newspaper stand 
might say, “I’ll buy the Star today”. In respect of at least some of the headlines put to her from 
the pages of the Star, she accepted that the consequence was that they were misleading.453 
Daily Express editor Hugh Whittow agreed that some of his headlines were designed to strike 
a resonance with the attitudes of his readers, but he too accepted that, in the “75 per cent 
say quit the EU” example at least, that meant the headline was misleading.454 OK! Magazine’s 
Lisa Byrne noted a tension between the need to sell the magazine and the need for accuracy 
in teasers, but thought that, except in limited examples (a story about Wayne and Coleen 
Rooney and Sienna Miller example) OK! had not crossed the line into being misleading.455

F

9.34  What seems clear is that, faced with a fiercely competitive market, some titles have found 
themselves  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  line  between  an  attention-grabbing  but  accurate 
headline and an embellished and inaccurate headline.456

Deliberate or reckless inaccuracy in respect of big stories

9.35  A third category of inaccurate reporting of which the Inquiry heard substantial evidence was 
a tendency in parts of the press to set aside the need for rigorous fact checking in the context 
of fast moving and high profile stories. The clearest examples of this practice are the highest 
profile:  the  defamatory  and  reckless  reporting  of  the  McCanns  and  Mr  Jefferies,  dealt  with 
above457.

457 Part F, Chapter 5

682

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public9.36  Notably, this tendency was not limited to tabloid newspapers: in respect of Mr Jefferies in 
particular the broadsheets were not blameless. In addition, Mr Davies gave an example of 
the  Guardian’s  reporting  of  the  Haut  de  la  Garenne  children’s  home  story  as  an  example 
of where the Guardian, amongst others, had published inaccurate articles in circumstances 
where greater care would have led to the conclusion that there was no basis for the story. 
Consistent with the McCann and Jefferies examples, there was limited information available 
at the time of the reports of the alleged murders, torture and burials at the Jersey children’s 
home, but a significant public demand for information. Mr Davies said:458

“We want the story that will sell papers, so therefore you pick the sexiest possible 
way of telling it.

The problems that are associated with that I think spread across the spectrum. I’m 
not exempting the Guardian from problems. We have run stories which were clearly 
false. The Jersey children’s home – do you remember that, a couple of years ago – 
where the idea was that the police had evidence that children had been killed and 
buried in the ruins of an old children’s home on the isle of Jersey. That’s a classic of 
what Richard [Peppiatt] was trying to describe earlier. The evidence for the truth of 
that proposition is screaming its falsehood. So, for example, the police said, “We have 
been looking into the ruins of this building and we have found a cellar which is exactly 
like the cellar which is described by our survivor witnesses.” It’s “very dark”. Cellars 
are  dark.  It  means  nothing.  Then  they  said,  “And  in  this  cellar  we  found  a  bath”, 
and it’s quite alarming, this, the sort of hints of torturing. “It’s actually bolted to the 
floor”, as though everybody’s bath was mobile. It’s silly. It doesn’t make any sense.

So  then  the  problem  that  occurred  on  all  newspapers  across  the  whole  spectrum 
is it’s too good a story to knock down. So it’s exactly what Richard was saying.  A 
reporter from any paper is sent out to Jersey to follow up on this story. The reporter 
who rings up and says, “Actually, this is crap, there’s just no evidence for this at all”, 
they will not be thanked. It’s a great story.”

9.37  These  examples,  along  with  some  others,  are  part  of  the  evidence  base  for  a  broader 
conclusion, that in respect of stories that become “big stories” followed by all the press, and 
generally involving crime or a very high profile individual, there is a tendency amongst large 
parts of the press to disregard the rule book.

Inaccurate reporting of political issues to fit the world view of 
a title

9.38  The  Inquiry  heard  a  great  deal  of  evidence  on  the  extent  to  which  newspapers  ought  to 
distinguish between fact and comment in reporting; a requirement to do so is contained in 
the Editors’ Code.459 It was almost universally accepted by the witnesses who appeared at the 
Inquiry that the distinction between fact and comment, particularly in respect of the reporting 
of political issues, had been substantially blurred in recent years. Former Prime Ministers the 
Rt Hon Tony Blair and the Rt Hon Gordon Brown gave evidence of the corrosive effect that 

458 pp85-86, lines 13–18, Nick Davies, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Transcript-of-
Morning-Hearing-29-November-2011.pdf 
459 Clause 1(iii) of the Code states: “The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must distinguish clearly between comment, 
conjecture and fact”

683

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

this blurring of news and comment could have on political life.460 To varying extents, others, 
including the Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke461 and the broadcaster Jon Snow,462 agreed.

9.39  Although some consideration was given to whether this development justified criticism, it 
seems to me that the blurring of fact and comment, although prohibited in the Editors’ Code, 
is an inevitable part of press reporting in the 21st century. That is so for two reasons. First, 
because purely factual reporting devoid of all opinion is, to all practical purposes, impossible: 
the choice of stories to publish in a newspaper, and the facts chosen to include in a particular 
story,  will  necessarily  be  influenced  by  a  newspaper’s  agenda  and  opinions.  Secondly, 
because  in  a  world  of  24  hour  television  and  online  news,  readers  expect  newspapers  to 
provide  something  more  than  pure  news:  campaigns,  opinions  and  comment  are  what  a 
readership demands and it is not always possible or indeed desirable to divorce these from 
pure reporting of the news. That is not to say that newspapers should not seek to identify, 
where possible, what is primarily news and what is primarily commentary. But it is to say that 
that the fusion of news and comment in the press is not necessarily a practice that is harmful 
or worthy of criticism.

9.40  However, what is harmful and what is worthy of criticism is a practice identified in sections of 
the press of prioritising the worldview of a title over the accuracy of a story. Mr Campbell, a 
supporter of what he called “agenda journalism” (where news and comment are necessarily 
fused), nonetheless argued that sections of the press had taken agenda journalism to a point 
where it transgressed into the realms of invention and/or reckless inaccuracy.463 Mr Peppiatt’s 
evidence in relation to the top-down pressure experienced at the Daily Star to uncover stories 
that fit within a particular “narrative” is a prime example of this and is discussed above..

9.41  Full Fact has monitored press accuracy since April 2010. It provided a comprehensive and 
extremely helpful submission464 to the Inquiry which identified a range of inaccurate articles, 
including many where the inaccuracy appears to be the result of the title’s agenda taking 
precedence or assuming too great a significance over and beyond the facts of the underlying 
story.  It  seems  that  stories  on  political  issues  are  most  likely  to  suffer  from  this  form  of 
inaccuracy; examples are considered within the following categories: (i) disability and social 
welfare benefits; (ii) criminal justice issues; (iii) immigration; and (iv) Europe and Britain’s role 
within it.

9.42 

In relation to articles on disability and social welfare benefits, Full Fact provided numerous 
examples of misleading articles about the transition from the old Incapacity Benefit (IB) to 
the new Employment Support Allowance (ESA). Each article appeared to support an agenda 
of exposing benefit frauds and getting the ‘work-shy’ back into work. Full Fact provided many 
examples, all of which could have been included in this Report: by way of illustration only, 
three are referred to.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public9.43  First, the Daily Mail published an article under the headline ‘400,000 ’were trying it on’ to get 
sickness benefits: 94% of incapacity benefits [sic] can work’. In fact the report on which the 
article was based had reported that, in the transition from IB to ESA, only 6% of sickness benefit 
claimants had been assessed as unsuitable for any kind of work related activity. However, 
many of the 94% of people described in the headline as “trying it on” and “fit for work” were 
those assessed as falling with the ‘Work Related Activity Group’ (WRAG) for the purposes of 
ESA; that is, they were eligible to claim ESA, considered unsuitable for immediate work, but 
potentially suitable for work in the future. That included people undergoing chemotherapy 
or dialysis treatment, hospital in-patients, and those suffering from uncontrollable and life 
threatening diseases, none of whom would ordinarily be thought of as “trying it on” to claim 
sickness benefit.465

9.44  Second, The Sun’s article, ‘Fit as a Fiddler: ‘Sick’ spongers could start work right now’ suggested 
1.8 million people on sickness benefit were fit for work, or would be fit for work within “a 
few weeks”. The 1.8 million “spongers” described in the headline included the same group 
as those described as “trying it on” by the Daily Mail: those placed in the WRAG who were 
assessed as unsuitable for immediate work, but potentially suitable for work in the future, 
including cancer patients, those with renal failure, hospital in-patients and others suffering 
from  serious  diseases.  The  suggestion  that  this  group  would  be  fit  for  work  within  a  few 
weeks had no factual basis.466

9.45  Third,  the  Daily  Telegraph  published  an  article  reporting  ‘Nine  out  of  10  sickness  benefit 
claimants are judged fit to work’. That ‘nine out of 10’ judged “fit to work” included not only 
those in the WRAG, but also those who had withdrawn their claims because their condition 
had improved between application and assessment. In that context, it was not only misleading 
to refer to the ‘nine out of 10’ as “fit to work”, but it was also misleading to include within the 
figures the category of people who had withdrawn their claims and were therefore no longer 
“claimants”.467

9.46  The  House  of  Commons  Work  and  Pensions  Select  Committee  was  critical  of  the  press 

coverage of welfare reform in its 6th Report. It noted:468

“Sections  of  the  media  routinely  use  pejorative  language,  such  as  “work-shy”  or 
“scrounger”, when referring to incapacity benefit claimants. We strongly deprecate 
this and believe that it is irresponsible and inaccurate. The duty on the state to provide 
adequate support through the benefits system for people who are unable to work 
because of a serious health condition or illness is a fundamental principle of British 
society. Portraying the reassessment of incapacity benefit claimants as some sort of 
scheme to “weed out benefit cheats” shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the 
Government’s objectives.
41.  … In the end, the media will choose its own angle, but the Government should 
take great care with the language it itself uses and take all possible steps to ensure 
that context is provided when information about IB claimants found fit for work is 
released, so that unhelpful and inaccurate stories can be shown to have no basis.”

9.47  The Select Committee is right to acknowledge that the media is entitled to choose whatever 
angle on a story it wishes, particularly on matters of political importance. Nonetheless, there 
is an important distinction to be made between “taking an angle” and plain inaccuracy. It is 
vital that the press is cautious not allow the former to lead to the latter.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

9.48  Full Fact identified a number of examples of misreporting on criminal justice issues where 
it also appears that this line was transgressed. In March 2011, both the Daily Mail and the 
Daily Express published articles reporting that new sentencing guidelines would allow those 
supplying class A drugs to avoid a custodial sentence if they were playing a ‘subordinate’ role 
in a criminal gang. The Daily Mail’s piece was headlined, “Heroin Dealers to Escape Jail: new 
sentencing proposals mean pushers would go free”; the Express headline was “It’s madness 
to let drug dealers escape prison”. The reality is that the new sentencing guidelines made no 
change at all to the approach to sentencing those involved in the supply of drugs, but broadly 
instead preserved the status quo.469 Nonetheless, the stories fit within an established agenda 
to resist a general “softening” in criminal sentencing.

9.49  Full Fact noted these articles as part of a general trend within parts of the press to misreport 
stories on criminal sentencing to give an impression of a judiciary soft on crime and criminals. 
Retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Stephen Sedley recently spoke about this narrative in parts 
of the press and expressed his concerns as to its effect. He said to the Joint Committee on 
Privacy and Injunctions that:470

“over the 20 years or so since I first became a judge a relentless campaign of accusing 
judges  of  being  soft  on  crime  and  under-sentencing  has  led  to  the  escalation  of 
sentencing, which has now filled our prisons to bursting, about which it is recognised 
something needs to be done. That is insidious; it is very difficult to put your finger 
on  any  one  newspaper  article  or  case  in  which  it  has  happened,  but  as  a  trend  it 
undoubtedly has happened.”

9.50  The Howard League for Penal Reform also gave evidence in relation to the misrepresentation 
of criminal sentencing. It noted The Sun’s article on the sentencing of the mother of Baby 
Peter (formerly known as Baby P), and its expression of outrage that she could “walk free 
in just over 3 years”. The reality is that she had been given an indeterminate sentence for 
public protection (IPP), with a minimum tariff of five years. Under that sentence, the woman 
in question would only be released if she were deemed to pose no risk to the public, failing 
which she would remain in prison indefinitely and potentially for life. While it was technically 
true that, having served almost two years of her sentence on remand, she was eligible to be 
considered for parole after a further three years, the failure to mention that she had been 
given an IPP sentence, would not be released if she was considered a danger to the public 
and could remain in prison for life rendered the article significantly misleading.471

9.51  Similarly misleading reporting was noted in relation to immigration issues (some of which is 
discussed above). Further evidence included, for instance, a Daily Mail article alleging that 
a failed asylum seeker who had challenged deportation from Britain, was told he could stay 
“because he goes to the gym”. The article was erroneous on several bases. First, the judge had 
not granted the failed asylum seeker any leave to remain in the UK, but had simply required 
the Home Office to reconsider his application because of flaws in the decision making process. 
Second, at no stage in the judgment did the judge indicate that the individual’s membership 
of a gym was in any way a factor in his favour. Although one sentence of the judgment referred 
to  the  fact  that  the  individual  had  made  friends  at  a  gym,  that  sentence  was  a  summary 
of the failed asylum seeker’s submissions to the court, rather than any part of the judge’s 

469 p15, ibid. The only proposed alteration to the sentencing approach to class A drugs concerned drugs mules 
although they also would continue to receive substantial custodial sentences

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicreasoning.472 It is unclear if the misunderstanding of the judgment in the article was careless 
or deliberate. Nonetheless, the story fits neatly within a campaign pursued by the newspaper 
against Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or what the Daily Mail has 
called the “human right to sponge off the UK”.473

9.52  A  further  Daily  Mail  story  headlined  “Immigration  soars  20  per  cent  last  year  making  a 
mockery of government pledge to bring it down”, was mirrored by the Daily Express with its 
headline “Immigration soars 20%”. In fact, the report on which both articles were based made 
clear that immigration had remained stable, but net migration had increased by 20% because 
emigration had fallen.474 Another article in the Daily Express, headlined “Migrants more likely 
to claim jobless benefit”, reported that a study had shown that migrants to the UK were more 
likely to claim unemployment benefit than people from the UK. In fact the report on which 
the article was based concluded that migrants, who were claiming benefits, were more likely 
than non-migrants, who were claiming benefits, to be claiming job seekers allowance, but 
migrants as a whole were less likely to claim benefits than the UK born population.475 Once 
again, it is unclear whether the errors were careless or deliberate, but they did fit within 
consistent agendas pursued by each newspaper.

9.53  Articles relating to the European Union, and Britain’s role within it, accounted for a further 
category of story where parts of the press appeared to prioritise the title’s agenda over factual 
accuracy. On Europe, Mr Campbell said:476

“Several  of  our  national  daily  titIes  –  The  Sun,  The  Express,  The  Star,  The  Mail, 
The  Telegraph  in  particular-  are  broadly  anti-European.  At  various  times,  readers 
of  these  and  other  newspapers  may  have  read  that  ’Europe’  or  ’Brussels”  or  ’the 
EU superstate’ has banned, or is intending to ban kilts, curries, mushy peas, paper 
rounds,  Caerphilly  cheese,  charity  shops,  bulldogs,  bent  sausages  and  cucumbers, 
the British Army, lollipop ladies, British loaves, British made lavatories, the passport 
crest, lorry drivers who wear glasses, and many more. In addition, if the Eurosceptic 
press is to be believed, Britain is going to-be, forced to unite as a single country with 
France,  Church  schools  are  being  forced  to  hire  atheist  teachers,  Scotch  whisky  is 
being-classified as an inflammable liquid, British soldiers must take orders in French, 
the price of chips is being raised by Brussels, Europe is insisting on one size fits all 
condoms, new laws are being proposed on how to climb, a ladder, it will be a criminal 
offence to criticise Europe, Number 10 must fly the European flag, and finally, Europe 
is brainwashing our children with pro-European propaganda! Of the UK press and the 
European institutions – I speak as something of a Eurosceptic by Blairite standards – 
it is clear who does more brainwashing. Some of the examples, may appear trivial, 
comic even. But there is a serious point: that once some of our newspapers decide to 
campaign on a certain issue, they do so with scant regard for fact. These stories are 
written by reporters, rewritten by subs, and edited by editors who frankly must know 
them to be untrue. This goes beyond the fusion of news and comment, to the area of 
invention.”

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF9.54  Although Mr Campbell’s evidence may have been exaggerated for effect, there is certainly 
clear evidence of misreporting on European issues. Mr Campbell drew attention to a Daily 
Mail story claiming that “the EU” was going to ban grocers from selling eggs by the dozen, 
followed by a story that there had been a U-turn and the ban would no longer take place. 
The reality is that there had never been a ban proposed and the original story was based 
on a deliberate or careless misinterpretation of EU proposals.477 Full Fact drew attention to 
a number of further ‘anti-EU’ stories which misrepresented facts, including a Daily Express 
report on EU plans to ‘ban’ plastic shopping bags, when the reality was that a consultation 
had been launched to explore a variety of options, including a potential ban, for reducing 
waste from plastic bags.478

9.55  The factual errors in the examples above are, in certain respects, trivial. But the cumulative 
impact can have serious consequences. Mr Blair explained that the misinformation published 
about Europe by some parts of the press made it difficult for him to adopt particular policies 
or achieve certain political ends in Europe that he might otherwise have done. He said:479

“My  distinction  is  between  that  and  how  you  actually  report  the  story  as  a  piece 
of journalism. So if you take the issue to do with Europe, what I would say is that 
those papers who are Eurosceptic are perfectly entitled to be Eurosceptic. They’re 
perfectly entitled to highlight things in Europe that are wrong. What they shouldn’t 
do is, frankly, make up a whole lot of nonsense about Europe and dish that up to the 
readers, because that’s – I mean, how does the reader know that’s not correct?”

F

9.56  That,  ultimately,  is  the  foundation  of  the  criticism  made  in  this  section:  there  can  be  no 
objection to agenda journalism (which necessarily involves the fusion of fact and comment), 
but that cannot trump a requirement to report stories accurately. Clause 1 of the Editors’ Code 
explicitly, and in my view rightly, recognises the right of a free press to be partisan; strong, 
even very strong, opinions can legitimately influence the choice of story, placement of story 
and angle from which a story is reported. But that must not lead to fabrication, or deliberate 
or careless misrepresentation of facts. Particularly in the context of reporting on issues of 
political  interest,  the  press  have  a  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  public  are  accurately 
informed so that they can engage in the democratic process. The evidence of inaccurate and 
misleading reporting on political issues is therefore of concern. The previous approach of the 
PCC to entertaining complaints only where they came from an affected individual may have 
allowed a degree of impunity in this area: in the context of misleading reporting on political 
issues,  representative  bodies  are  likely  to  be  far  better  placed  to  monitor,  and  complain 
about, inaccuracies.

9.57 

Science reporting
In  many  ways,  the  imperative  for  accuracy  in  political  reporting  is  matched  in  relation  to 
science  reporting.  There  is  a  significant  public  interest  in  the  press  reporting  scientific 
advances, discoveries or reports in an easily accessible way. The evidence received by the 
Inquiry suggested that science reporting had improved in recent years and that the majority 
of science reporting was responsible and accurate.480 However, in the minority of cases where

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicthe press reports a science story carelessly or inaccurately, it can cause substantial damage. 
As the Science Media Centre wrote:481

“The potential of the media to influence and inform the public on science comes with 
a huge responsibility. When the media gets it wrong the impact is devastating and 
causes  real  harm  to  individuals  and  society.  The  furore  over  the  measles,  mumps 
and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which started in 1998 after a rogue doctor claimed a 
link between the vaccine and autism, is the best known example of how poor media 
reporting can cause harm. Vaccination rates before the story stood at about 92% but 
dropped down to 80% after the scare, and it has taken close to 15 years to get over 
the damage. Cases of measles in England and Wales rose from 56 in 1998 to 1,370 
in 2008.”

9.58 

In respect of the MMR story, it is correct that the press as a whole were reporting the work 
of a qualified medical practitioner, as published in a respected medical journal. However, the 
Science Media Centre, the Association of Medical Research Charities, Cancer Research UK, the 
Wellcome Trust, and Sense about Science all considered that the press shared responsibility 
for the scandal, primarily because a single doctor’s research, based on a small case study, 
which conflicted with all other research in the field and conflicted with the great majority of 
medical opinion, was unjustifiably given front page prominence.482

9.59  The MMR example was cited by each of these organisations as an example of false balance 
within the press: that is to say, where the scientific view of a very small minority is given 
prominence which suggests that there is a significant conflict of opinion within the scientific 
community.483 As Fiona Fox, Chief Executive of the Science Media Centre, said in relation to 
the MMR scare:484

“Time and time again the editor demanded that the fact that 99.99999 per cent of 
medical science believed this vaccine to be safe had to be balanced in every article by 
Andrew Wakefield or one of his supporters. So you have the terrible situation where 
a MORI poll showed, at the height of this crisis, that nearly 60 per cent of the British 
public thought that medical science was divided. That’s the bit on which the media 
let the public down.”

9.60  False balance (or on occasion, overtly politicised reporting) was noted as a general concern in 
relation to other topics, including the reporting of GM crops and climate change.485 The Daily 
Express’s article ‘100 reasons why global warming is natural’ was identified as an example 
of where false balance, or the title’s political agenda, resulted in a misleading and inaccurate 
piece of science reporting.486 The Association of Medical Research Charities, Cancer Research 
UK, and the Wellcome Trust wrote:487

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

“The media often has a tendency to pursue balance in its stories, by countering one 
claim with another, and allowing alternative viewpoints a right of reply. This is perfectly 
proper in, for example, political reporting. Yet in science, the practice can often lead 
to distortions of its own. In science, it is often the case that a mainstream opinion 
about the interpretation of known data is shared overwhelmingly by professionals 
in that field, for example with the safety of the MMR vaccine or the link between 
greenhouse gases and global warming.
When this is the case, the effect of balancing opinion to stoke debate can be to create 
a misleading impression that dissent from the mainstream view is more widespread 
and serious than it actually is.”

9.61 

In addition to a problem of false balance, the Inquiry heard that there is a tendency in parts 
of the press to sensationalise science news headlines. Ms Fox noted that the content of the 
copy of science stories, written by science reporters, was generally exemplary, but that the 
headlines  attached  by  sub-editors  tended  to  misrepresent  and  exaggerate  the  underlying 
story.488 Those headlines tended to fit within the category of ‘scare story’ or ‘breakthrough’.

9.62  Within the category of ‘scare story’ the Inquiry saw examples including The Sun’s headline 
“Breast cancer risk all over shops’ shelves”. The underlying research showed that traces of 
household chemicals are found in the breast tissue of women with breast cancer but the 
research did not find any causal link between the chemicals and breast cancer, let alone a 
causal link sufficient to justify the headline.489 Similarly, a number of newspapers published 
stories, based on a British Medical Journal (BMJ) report, advising pregnant women against 
sleeping on their right (’Sleeping on left cuts stillbirths: New advice for mums-to-be’ (Mirror); 
’Sleep on your left to avoid stillbirth’ (Sun); ’Sleeping on your right side “could put your unborn 
baby at risk”’ (Mail)). However, the study’s own authors, the BMJ editorial, the BMJ press 
release and a set of expert comments released by the Science Media Centre all stated clearly 
that the study on which the article was based was not sufficient evidence to provide any new 
health advice to pregnant women.490

9.63  The Daily Mail has a clear commitment to reporting on health issues, as evidenced by its 
weekly  “Good  Health”  supplement,  but  it  has  also  been  criticised  for  headlining  with 
unjustified scare stories. One example seen by the Inquiry was the Daily Mail’s report of a 
“Cancer danger of that night-time trip to the toilet”. The underlying research showed that 
interrupting the circadian rhythms of mice by flashing lights for one hour pulses during a 
12  hour  night  time  cycle  could  cause  damage  to  cell  division.  The  research  did  not  show 
a causal relationship between interruptions of circadian rhythm and cancer, but suggested 
that further research could investigate whether there might be such a link. Although one of 
the researchers said in an interview that turning on an artificial light at night could have an 
impact on the body clock, there was no suggestion in the research, nor in the interview, that 
a night-time trip to the toilet causes cancer.491

9.64 

It is appropriate to mention a more recent example of a slightly different type of science story 
which causes concern. On 26 June 2012 the Daily Mail published an article that purported 
to describe the findings of research undertaken by scientists at the University of New York.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicThe  headline  in  the  Mail  Online  read  “Racism  is  Hardwired  into  the  Brain”.492  The  article 
itself made a number of points, including: “It’s possible, the researchers say, that even right-
thinking, ‘egalitarian’ people could harbour racist attitudes without knowing”.

9.65  This interpretation of the scientific research put forward in the Daily Mail article has since been 
rebutted in terms in a letter to the Guardian by the team of scientists at New York University 
who conducted that research.493 Further, Dr Elizabeth Phelps, the lead researcher who is also 
cited in the Daily Mail article, has made clear in the relevant correspondence that the Daily 
Mail did not contact the researchers for comment, but rather quoted selectively from the 
press release announcing their findings.494 Dr Phelps et al criticised the interpretation of the 
research put forward by the Daily Mail, and in particular the use of words like “hardwired”, 
as “irresponsible”.495

9.66 

In response to questions from the Inquiry, Martin Clarke, editor of the Mail Online, said that 
the article was written from copy supplied by a respectable agency, National News.496 Mr 
Clarke also stated that the article was published by others under a very similar headline. He 
drew to the attention of the Inquiry the example of Medical Daily, an online trade journal and 
news aggregator for the medical profession, published in the USA.497 However, Mr Clarke did 
not mention that the Medical Daily report appears to rely heavily on the Mail’s own article, 
and reads:498

‘“A  few  decades  ago,  it  was  unthinkable  that  looking  at  the  brain  to  understand 
representations of social groups such as black versus white was even possible, let 
alone  that  such  explorations  could  yield  useful  knowledge,”  the  authors  wrote, 
according to the Daily Mail.’

9.67  The  argument  that  the  article  has  been  provided  by  an  established  News  Agency,  or 
alternatively  published  by  others  under  a  similar  headline,  if  correct,  merely  serves  to 
demonstrate that this lapse of standards occurred in publications beyond the Mail. On any 
view, this was contentious and problematic material, and merited careful handling. Further, it 
was not in the nature of a story which necessitated urgent treatment.

9.68  Examples of scare stories are not limited to health journalism; the reporting of climate change 
is also susceptible to exaggeration. When a Nature paper modelling climate change projected 
warming between 2 degrees and 11 degrees, almost all the newspapers carried the latter 
figure in their headlines, with one tabloid splashing a huge 11 degrees on the front page 
alongside an apocalyptic image. This was in spite of the fact that the press briefing to launch 
the paper had all emphasised that the vast majority of models showed warming around 2 
degrees.499

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF9.69  The impact of these kinds of scare stories can be twofold: first they can create unnecessary 
public  anxiety, and (as in the case of the MMR scandal) have a consequently detrimental 
impact  on  public  health;  and  second,  they  can  have  a  “cry  wolf”  effect,  reducing  trust  in 
science reporting generally.

9.70  The flipside of the scare-story is the overblown ‘breakthrough’. As noted by the Association of 

Medical Research Charities, Cancer Research UK, and the Wellcome Trust:500

“Many newspapers (though not all of them) are apt to exaggerate interesting but 
preliminary  advances  in  biomedical  science,  proclaiming  them  as  groundbreaking 
achievements that will transform individuals’ health when in fact they are reporting 
nothing  more  than  promising  results  from  experiments  on  mice,  or  cells  grown  in 
culture.”

9.71  Examples of such stories included stories based on a report in Nature magazine that a drug 
discovered in the soil on Easter Island may have the effect of extending life in mice, but was 
expressly said to be harmful to humans. Nonetheless, the headlines included: ““Scientists 
discover Easter Island ’fountain of youth’ drug that can extend life by ten years”, “Easter Island 
drug ’adds decade to life” and “New pill can add decades to life”.501 Similarly, an example 
from The Independent was a story about the use of human stem cells to regenerate growth 
headlined,  ‘Once  they  were  blind,  now  they  see.  Patients  treated  with  cells  from  human 
embryo’. Unfortunately, the research on which the article was based did not show that stem 
cells had caused blind people to see again. It had simply shown that stem cells could be used 
safely in humans. There was no evidence that the stem cells, rather than chance, had caused 
two of the subjects of the experiment to show marginal improvements in their vision.502

9.72  Such exaggerated ‘breakthrough’ reporting can have several negative consequences. First, 
it can raise expectations for advances in medical science which are not met. This can feed a 
public perception that science is always promising and never delivering. Secondly, it can raise 
false hopes for patients. As the Association of Medical Research Charities, Cancer Research 
UK, and the Wellcome Trust noted:503

F

“This is particularly true and damaging where it concerns treatments for incurable 
diseases that are not proven, yet which are portrayed as “miracle cures”. This can 
lead patients to spend life savings on treatments that are most unlikely to work, or on 
occasion to eschew the most effective known therapies in favour of alternatives that 
are untested or disproved.”

9.73  Ms Fox suggested that the press ought to exercise a little more caution in the prominence 
given to science stories and in the choice of headline. She noted that the press like to publish 
extraordinary  claims,  but  need  to  ensure  that  those  claims  are  backed  by  extraordinary 
evidence. She said:504

“We are not proposing that the media ignore extraordinary stories but that they treat 
them with extra caution and demand at least some strong evidence before going to 
print. This may simply mean putting these stories further inside the paper rather than

on the findings, and following up these stories with equally significant coverage if the 
claims are refuted.”

9.74  Assessing  the  evidence  as  a  whole,  it  is  clear  that  science  reporting  is  generally  accurate 
and  responsible.  However,  the  examples  of  inaccurate  reporting  identified  by  the  various 
witnesses demand attention. Given the important public interest in science journalism, and 
the  potential  harm  caused  by  overblown  or  sensational  science  reporting,  greater  care  is 
needed by parts of the press prior to publishing sensational headlines of breakthroughs or 
scares. In addition, further consideration should be given to the need to provide balanced 
reporting without giving unjustified credence to minority views.

9.75  At  the  end  of  her  evidence  I  invited  Ms  Fox  to  provide  some  draft  guidelines  for  science 
journalism which, if followed, would reduce the risk of the press printing the type of story 
that has received critical comment. Ms Fox has responded to that request and has produced 
guidelines505 which in my view are commendable for their utility as well as their succinctness. 
Any new regulator should bear them closely in mind.

9.76 

Conclusion
In their various submissions and representations to the Inquiry, the Press Core Participants 
and others with a similar interest have urged on me that factual error cannot be eliminated 
in press reporting, and that the evidence adduced to the Inquiry falls short of supporting the 
proposition that the problem is sufficiently serious or widespread to be classed as systemic, 
cultural or generic. I have paid close regard to these submissions, and I have not lost sight 
of the point that the Inquiry is inevitably taking a snap-shot of a picture which is immensely 
complex and multi-faceted. I have already made the point that the issue is not about quantity.506 
Taking all these matters on board, and assessing the evidence as a whole, I have come to the 
conclusion that there does exist a cultural strand or tendency within a section of the press 
to practice journalism which on occasion is deliberately, recklessly or negligently inaccurate. 
In other words, this is not simply a matter of accidental (or co-incidental) understandable 
human error.

9.77  The reasons for the existence of this cultural strand go further than the obvious and basic fact 
that stories are often written under pressure of approaching deadlines and it is inevitable that 
errors will occur. The pressures I am particularly concerned about are of a different nature: 
specifically, the commercial and personal pressures operating on journalists in an extremely 
competitive market to be the first to achieve the ‘scoop’, to place a novel slant on a story 
which  otherwise lacks punch,  or at worst to manufacture the facts or detail  of  a story to 
maintain the interest of the readership.

9.78  As with other similar cultural problems which I have identified in this Chapter, the requirement 
is for the creation of a regulator with more robust powers, not to censor or control the content 
of press reporting but to set out firmer and clearer ethical and professional standards whose 
adherence would directly lead to far fewer (measured both qualitatively and quantitatively) 
of the types of sub-standard reporting this chapter has identified. In that regard, the value of 
the work carried out by Full Fact is extremely important and I am pleased to recognise that 
Full Fact can claim to be one of the organisations that does seek to ‘guard the guardians’.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF10.  Financial controls and payments for stories

Controls on payments

10.1  The Operation Motorman revelations, along with the evidence of phone hacking at NoTW 
highlighted a significant problem with the control over cash payments within a number of 
newspaper titles. The evidence received by the Inquiry suggests that some improvements 
have been introduced to address the supervision of cash payments,507 but there was certainly 
some evidence to suggest that more could be done in some titles.508 Without engaging in the 
evidence relating to payments to public officials, which for reasons already described cannot 
be addressed in any detail, it is not possible to conclude in this Report that the supervision 
and control of cash payments is a practice for which the press, or parts of the press, deserve 
criticism as a whole.

10.2  However,  the  evidence  heard  by  the  Inquiry  did  raise  substantial  concerns  in  relation  to 
the  payment  of  sources  generally,  whether  by  cash  or  electronically.  The  concern  arises 
not  necessary  because  those  sources  are  or  are  likely  to  be  acting  unlawfully  (such  as 
Mr  Whittamore  or  Mr  Mulcaire),  but  because  the  very  act  of  payment  may  reduce  the 
reliability of the information, and/or encourage breaches of privacy.

F

10.3  The evidence of the ‘fake stories’ and ‘medical records’ stings in Mr Atkins’ ‘Starsuckers’ shone 
a light on this problematic issue. The evidence heard by the Inquiry is that the practice of 
paying sources for stories was widespread and continuing. Although there are undoubtedly 
circumstances in which payments for stories may be justified (see the MPs’ expenses stories) 
the evidence suggested payments for stories may incentivise exaggeration or fabrication and/
or encourage breaches of privacy. For those reasons, it is worth exploring the evidence of this 
practice in some detail.

10.4  The Inquiry has been told that virtually all tabloid newspapers accept stories from members 
of the public, and indeed, many pay for that information. Most broadsheets, including the 
Financial Times, The Independent, the Daily Telegraph, The Times and the Guardian do not 
actively seek stories from the public and prefer not to work in this way, but all except the 
Guardian  and  the  Financial  Times  would  still  pay  for  information  if  justified  by  the  public 
interest.509

Advertising for stories

10.5  Both journalists and editors have told the Inquiry that they regard tip-offs from the general 
public as an important source of legitimate information. In particular, they have made clear 
that the importance of such information to newspapers should be recognised in the form 
of payment to the individuals who supply it. In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Myler said 
that it was entirely legitimate for newspapers to make payments to sources for information 
that  was  newsworthy.510  This  view  is  shared  by  others  in  the  industry,  including  Mazher 
Mahmood, who said that he believed that it was important that members of the public were

a difference between making payment for a tip-off that is made without encouragement or 
request, and actively soliciting tip-offs through advertising for stories.

10.6  Traditionally, the tabloid press has advertised for information or stories through prominent 
advertisements in the pages of the particular newspaper and, in some cases, on the straplines 
of relevant columns,  or through  prominently sited and  easy to find  web-pages. Mr Smart 
confirmed The Sun’s approach: page 2 of the newspaper routinely carries a telephone number 
that members of the public can call directly if they have stories that they perceive to be of 
potential interest to the newspaper.512 By way of example, on Friday 30th March 2011, this 
advertisement read:

“Get cash for your stories:
We are always after good story – and we pay big money for them every day. If you’ve 
got a story about a celebrity, a scandal, a human interest story or any other great tip, 
call our newsdesk today. Don’t worry about the cost – we’ll call you straight back.”

10.7 

In addition to the telephone number The Sun also provides an email address and Twitter link 
through which members of the public might contact the paper.

10.8 

Just like The Sun, the NoTW also advertised for stories, drawing the attention of readers to the 
payments, (sometimes in cash but also by cheque or electronic means) that the newspaper 
might make for those stories. In addition to advertisements carried on both its website and 
on the pages of the newspaper itself, the NoTW also asked readers to suggest potential lines 
of Inquiry that its one time investigative journalist, Mr Mahmood, might further investigate. 
That call was carried on the byline for Mr Mahmood’s column and read:513

“Do you know a scandal that Maz should expose? If so, you can ring him any time.”

10.9 

In  addition  to  an  email  address,  a  phone  number  was  also  provided  to  facilitate  that 
communication from readers. The NoTW was unique in advertising for members of the public 
to help inform potential lines of Inquiry for the investigative journalists at the newspaper, 
and  in  fact  Mr  Mahmood  has  said  that  only  a  very  few  investigations  were  initiated  as  a 
consequence  of  information  received  from  members  of  the  public.514  Mostly,  where 
newspapers do advertise for stories, it is made clear, as is explored below, that the interest 
is in stories related to celebrities and other individuals with a public profile or, on a more 
limited basis, other human interest stories.

10.10  The Daily Mirror also advertises for stories and promises ‘big monies’ for them. Particularly, 
it  makes  mention  of  stories  relating  to  celebrities  and  other  people  with  a  public  profile. 
Like  The  Sun,  the  Daily  Mirror  advertises  for  stories  both  on  the  paper  as  well  as  on  the 
newspaper’s website through a link from the front page entitled ‘sell your story’.

695

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF10.11  The Daily Star also advertises for stories through a dedicated page on its website accessed 
through  a  drop-down  link  from  the  landing  page  of  the  newspaper’s  website.  That  page 
reads:515

“GOT A PICTURE OF CELEBS LETTING THEIR HAIR DOWN? LET US SEE THEM!
Get your camera phones working and send your photos, with details – who, where, 
when to us!
Messages cost £1 plus usual network charges, but we’ll pay a whopping £200 if your 
pics are used on the Goss pages.
LOVE CELEB GOSSIP? SO DO WE, SEND US YOUR STORY!
Know of a star behaving madly, sadly or badly?
For your chance to bag £200 – Send us your story with all the juicy details. If we use 
your story, we’ll send you the cash!* It’s as simple as that.”

10.12  In evidence to the Inquiry, representatives from the Daily Star emphasised the importance 
of showbusiness and celebrity stories to that paper. Ms Neesom, told the Inquiry that as the 
title was a relatively young newspaper it did not have the same established readership as 
some of its competitors.516 The paper therefore needed to ensure that the content it carried 
appealed to its readership. Ms Neesom said that reader interest lay substantially in stories 
about the lives of celebrities and other individuals with a public profile.517 A number of these 
stories were sourced from members of the public responding to the call for stories published 
in the Star newspaper itself.518

10.13  The  Daily  Express  also  advertises  for  stories  through  its  website.  Readers  are  encouraged 
to contact the paper through a number of media, including telephone, email and SMS text 
message.  It  is  notable  that  the  Daily  Express  website  makes  no  mention  of  payment  in 
exchange for information.

F

Levels of payment for material

10.14  Levels  of  payment  for  information  vary  from  newspaper  to  newspaper.  Peter  Wright,  the 
former editor of the Mail on Sunday, said that at the Mail Group payments of up to £50,000 
were  made  for  information  during  his  tenure.519  However,  he  was  also  clear  that  such  an 
amount would be paid in exceptional circumstances and only for a story of substantive and 
significant interest to the readers of Mail Group newspapers. Typically, such a story would take 
the form of an in-depth interview or a book serialisation.520 More typically, Mr Wright said, 
the amounts paid by the Mail Group for stories, and particularly to members of the public, 
were much smaller: in 2010, the highest amount paid was £3,500, and ‘they would most be 
a lot less than that’.521 Mr Wright said that whilst most payments were made electronically, 
the Mail Group would also make cash payments, because some of those individuals supplying 
material might not have bank accounts.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public10.15  In this respect, the operation of payment systems at the Daily Mail was similar to that at 
The Sun. There, cash payments were still made in a small number of circumstances. It was 
for individual journalists to make such requests for payments to senior staff and managing 
editors  for  authorisation.  Whilst  the  amounts  that  could  be  paid  for  information  to  third 
parties could be significant, they were dependent on the final size of the story when published 
and also the likely interest of the subject of the story to the readers. Typically, payments for 
stories made by The Sun ranged from between £600 and £10,000 depending on the size and 
nature of the story.

10.16  A similar scale of payment for information also existed at the NoTW. Mr Thurlbeck said that 
information leading to a front page splash might result in payments of up to £20,000.522 Mr 
McMullan explained that journalists working at the title, particularly those journalists working 
at the showbusiness desk, had access to substantive budgets without real oversight.523 Mr 
McMullan  has  said  that,  as  deputy  features  editor,  he  was  able  spend  amounts  of  up  to 
£10,000 on stories that resulted in a double page spread.524 In this position, he was able to 
make payments of up to £3,000 for a page lead, and sums of between £5,000 and £10,000 
for larger stories.525 Payments of more than £1,000 for any other story had to be authorised 
by the then editor.

10.17  Although  the  Inquiry  has  heard  that  payments  for  stories  supplied  by  members  of  the 
public would not normally exceed £10,000, other witnesses have suggested that in certain 
circumstances,  payments  for  certain  stories,  in  particular  “kiss  and  tell”  stories  involving 
individuals with a significant public profile, could be much higher. Mr Shear explained that 
competitive pressures could put significant upward pressure on payments made if the papers 
concerned understood the stories in question to be profitable.526 Mr Shear said that if stories 
involved a significantly high-profile celebrity, a kiss-and-tell story might cost: “something like 
10k to half a million.”527 Indeed, Mr Thurlbeck claimed that Rebecca Loos was paid a six figure 
sum for information about her relationship with the footballer, David Beckham.528

10.18  Similarly, in Mr Atkins’ discussions with a NoTW journalist in relation to his ‘medical records 
sting’,  the  journalist  set  out  the  paper’s  willingness  to  pay  amounts  substantially  greater 
than £10,000 for stories of likely interest to readers and therefore of potential value.529 Mr 
Atkins recorded the journalist as suggesting that the NoTW might be willing to pay £80,000, 
depending on the strength of the story.530

10.19  Irrespective of the final amounts that have been paid it is clear that issues around payment 
formed an important part of discussions between journalists and their interlocutors. Mr Atkins 
evidence  described  his  efforts  to  supply  and  sell  information  to  a  number  of  newspapers 
including the Sunday Mirror and the NoTW explaining that levels of payment were raised at 
the very outset of his discussions with the journalists from each newspaper.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFAccuracy and the credibility of material supplied by members of 
the public

Corroboration

10.20  The specific concerns at payments for information crystallise not principally around the type 
of  information  disclosed  by  sources  in  exchange  for  payment,  but  rather  that  the  fact  of 
payment might encourage the sources of that information to exaggerate, distort or simply 
fabricate the information that they seek to sell. The section above dealing with Mr Atkins’ 
‘fake stories’ sting suggests that the mechanisms for corroborating such information given by 
third parties may not be particularly effective.

10.21  The  Inquiry  has  received  evidence  from  a  number  of  different  newspapers  about  the 
processes followed to establish the credibility of stories and the veracity of accusations that 
may have been made by members of the public in the information they seek to sell. These 
processes were also designed to protect newspapers from potential legal actions for libel 
or defamation.531 Although not uniform, the descriptions of such processes in evidence to 
the Inquiry from journalists at The Sun, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Star, as well as at the 
NoTW, are similar.532 It is illustrative of practices across parts of the press that these processes 
were not formal and whilst a number of witnesses to the Inquiry have claimed that they were 
generally practised, they were not obligatory or uniformly enforced.

F

10.22  Mr  Smart  described  in  broad  terms  the  efforts  made  by  journalists  to  establish  both  the 
credibility  and  reliability  of  stories  that  were  provided  by  members  of  the  public.  These 
efforts might include journalists separately seeking corroboration of any allegations made 
through a number of sources.533 This might be done through contacting the subject of the 
story directly or indirectly through their agents or other representatives.534 Mr Smart said 
that the showbusiness journalists at The Sun had excellent contacts, particularly with the 
likely subject of stories submitted to the paper by members of the public; these contacts 
enable these journalists who might be pursuing such stories quickly to stand them up.535

10.23  A similar process is also followed at the Daily Mirror in response to potential stories supplied 
to the paper by members of the public. The practice there is to discuss potential stories with 
those who cold contact the paper, to make an initial assessment of the credibility as well as 
the value as a news item all during the initial telephone call. In those circumstances where 
journalists perceive stories to be credible, they might meet with the source to discuss the 
material further. Mr Owens suggested that journalists at the Mirror newspapers might also 
discuss the merits of a story with more senior colleagues on the news desk before deciding 
whether  to  pursue  it  further.  Mr  Owens  also  said  that  journalists  working  at  the  Sunday 
Mirror had access to a lawyer in the office at all times, to whom any concerns with stories 
could be addressed.536 In-house lawyers might also be involved in discussions with the news 
desk about the merits of a given story.537

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public10.24  Ms Neesom explained that it was the practice at the Daily Star to seek to corroborate all 
stories that were supplied by third parties.538 However, Ms Neesom also accepted that, in 
some cases, corroboration was not always possible, as the individuals in question were not 
always contactable.539 A failure to corroborate a story might not prevent its publication; this 
was so, particularly, if the story were unlikely to lead to the launch of legal challenge by the 
individual concerned. She also suggested that, in many cases, stories leaked to the newspaper 
by PR representatives working on behalf of particular celebrities would not be checked, given 
that they stories were essentially coming from the celebrity him or herself.540 The Inquiry 
was told that information submitted to the paper by members of the public, particularly in 
relation to so-called “kiss and tell” stories involving celebrities and other individuals with a 
public profile, was difficult to corroborate satisfactorily with the result that it was now less 
likely to be published than it once was.541

10.25  These informal mechanisms and processes for establishing the credibility of a story are also 
described and elaborated by Ms Marshall in her memoir, Tabloid Girl. Ms Marshall explained 
that when contacted by members of the public, journalists would pose a number of questions 
relating to that celebrity. According to Ms Marshall, the purpose in asking such questions 
was  intended  to  help  separate  those  members  of  the  public  who  may  possess  stories  of 
potential  interest  to  readers  from  those  who  had  contacted  the  newspaper  in  the  hope 
of securing payment for either spurious  or fabricated information. Ms Marshall explained 
that the questions asked by journalists in these circumstances were often informed by the 
specialist knowledge that they may have about the celebrities about whom they wrote.542 
This knowledge may be the result of relationships built up over a number of years with the 
celebrities in question.

Numbers

10.26  Although  representatives  of  the  press  who  have  given  evidence  to  the  Inquiry  have  not 
provided exact figures for the number of calls received from members of the public seeking 
to supply stories, they were clear that the numbers were substantial and provided the source 
material for a significant proportion of showbusiness stories each year. Mr Smart provided 
some sense of the scale of the information supplied in this way, as well as the demands on 
journalists working on showbusiness stories which accounted for the majority of telephone 
calls received.

10.27  Mr  Smart  explained  that  the  Bizarre  column  at  The  Sun  received  many  thousands  of 
telephone calls in response to advertisements in the paper calling for readers to sell their 
stories. He noted that the small team of journalists working on the Bizarre column produced 
approximately 60,000 stories each year. On average, each journalist working on that column 
was responsible for researching and writing up over 3,000 individual stories.543 He explained 
that  those  stories  provided  by  members  of  the  public  were  important  to  helping  achieve 
those targets.

10.28  Similarly, Mr Owens suggested that the volume of information received from members of the 
public at the Sunday Mirror was significant. Mr Owens said that the Sunday Mirror received 
“dozens”  of  stories  each  day  from  members  of  the  public.544  Mr  McMullan  also  reported 
that, during his time at the NoTW, he would receive up to 30 telephone calls each day from 
members of the public seeking to sell their stories.545

10.29  As a consequence, Mr Smart suggested that the volume of work required to produce sufficient 
copy as well as the very real limitations on resources available to journalists militated against 
the corroboration of all stories.546 Mr Smart said that it was the practice of the showbusiness 
desk only to seek to stand up the two lead stories or those which were most contentious.547 
Smaller stories and those which were unlikely to cause offence or reputational damage would 
not normally be fully corroborated.548 Mr Owens also admitted that, given the quantities of 
information received from the public, it was not always possible to run full checks on stories.

Judging whether a story is credible

10.30  A decision to run a story without having fully established the credibility of a source might be 
justified on a number of grounds. First, journalists might seek to establish some of the facts 
around a story but not necessarily all details, proceeding with the publication of the story 
on the basis of that partial corroboration. Second, as described in evidence by Mr Smart, 
journalists  might  judge that  a  story was  credible  given  their  knowledge of  the  individuals 
concerned or the knowledge of others individuals linked to that person.549 As an example, Mr 
Smart said that he decided to publish stories supplied to him by the documentary film-maker 
Mr Atkins, which later turned out to be fabricated, because they chimed with his knowledge 
of the people concerned. In response to questions about the likely veracity of a story supplied 
by Mr Atkins about the film maker Guy Ritchie (who it was alleged had injured himself while 
drunkenly juggling cutlery in a London restaurant), Mr Smart suggested he had known that 
Mr Ritchie had been in the restaurant in question at the time, and that he had managed to 
corroborate that Mr Ritchie was drunk at the time and was ‘misbehaving’. Mr Smart said that 
the references to juggling came only at the end of the article and were an “insignificant” part 
of a “trivial story”.550 However, Mr Smart did concede that it was unacceptable that somebody 
should be able deliberately to make up a story and that such a story should then appear in a 
newspaper.551

10.31  In relation to a story by Mr Atkins alleging that the singer Sarah Harding had a library full 
of  books  on  astro-physics,  Mr  Smart  suggested  that,  as  a  personal  acquaintance  of  Miss 
Harding, he was well placed to judge the credibility of Mr Atkins’ claim. Mr Smart told the 
Inquiry that he knew that Miss Harding had “quite an impressive library”.552 He also said that 
he contacted Miss Harding’s agent who said “it wouldn’t surprise me if she owned a book like 
that”.553 Mr Smart explained that this provided sufficient verification to decide in favour of

It is to note that, although in both of these cases the central allegation remained untrue, the 
general corroboration of some of the details of the allegations by the respective agents of 
Miss Harding and Mr Ritchie enabled Mr Smart to stand up the story sufficiently to mitigate 
the risk of legal action from either party.

Risks of payments for stories

10.32  There are two significant risks associated with the advertisement by newspapers for stories: 
first, that it may incentivise fabrication and/or exaggeration, and second that it may encourage 
breaches of privacy. The Inquiry has seen evidence of both.

Incentivising fabrication and exaggeration

10.33  In  his  evidence,  Mr  Atkins  argued  that  the  willingness  of  newspapers  to  pay  for  stories 
encouraged distortion and exaggeration on the part of sources and incentivised fabrication 
of  material,  particularly  as  the  materials  provided  may  frequently  go  unchecked  and 
unverified.554  Mr  Atkins  also  said  that,  in  his  view,  given  the  potentially  very  high  level  of 
payments involved, those members of the public seeking to sell stories to newspapers were 
often motivated more by profit than accuracy.555 Further, he suggested that the journalists 
he  spoke  with  encouraged  him  to  exaggerate  the  more  sensational  aspects  of  the  stories 
in question, in order that they might deliver more newsworthy content to their editors. Mr 
Atkins noted in his evidence that the more “outlandish” and sensational the stories he offered 
to the newspapers, the higher the level of payment that was offered in return.556

10.34  By way of example, Mr Atkins described to the Inquiry his attempt to sell a story about the 
Canadian pop singer, Avril Lavigne. Mr Atkins explained that he contacted the Daily Express 
and attempted to see if he might be able to interest the newspaper in a story about the singer 
falling asleep in the nightclub, Bungalow 8. Although the story was rejected by the journalist 
at the Express, that journalist suggested that the title would be more interested in running 
the story if Mr Atkins could come back with a story that Ms Lavigne had been found “smoking 
crack”. Mr Atkins was able to sell the original story to the Daily Mirror for £50 and the story 
was published without verification.557 Trinity Mirror has since accepted that it was wrong to 
have published the article and have published both a correction and issued an apology to 
Miss Lavigne.

10.35  Mr  Davies  explained  that  the  Guardian  had  adopted  the  approach  that,  as  a  matter  of 
principle, it would not pay for stories. He sought to explain that reasoning as one driven by 
practicalities rather than ethical, legal or financial considerations (although consideration of 
those issues had helped to inform the Guardian’s position).558 Essentially at one with Mr Leigh, 
the  position  of  Mr  Davies  was  that  the  purchase  of  information  might  lead  individuals  to 
fabricate material or exaggerate the extent and impact of material in order to increase the 
value of that information.559

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

10.36  Mr Leigh gave a specific example of a situation in which the Guardian had maintained this 
position, even where the information for sale was thought to be in the public interest. He 
spoke of a potential story about the infiltration by a major weapons manufacturer of the 
Campaign  Against  the  Arms  Trade.  The  source  of  the  information,  who  Mr  Leigh  and  his 
colleagues believed to be credible, had requested payment of approximately £20,000. Mr 
Leigh said that whilst he believed that the story was in the public interest, he could not in the 
circumstance justify the sum of money requested and also because it caused concerns that 
relevant details had been embellished or exaggerated.560 Mr Leigh also made it clear that he 
did not think that it would be possible to stand up the story without the information held by 
his source.561

10.37  The  Guardian’s  approach  is  admirable  and,  by  adopting  a  hard  line  on  payments  for 
information, the risk of fabrication and/or exaggeration is substantially limited. However, in 
saying that, I should not be interpreted as saying that the Guardian’s approach is the only 
legitimate  approach  and  should  therefore  be  adopted  by  all  titles.  As  noted  above,  the 
Daily Telegraph paid a substantial sum of money for the information which led to the MPs’ 
expenses scandal and I have made no criticism of the Telegraph’s decision to pay that money. 
The Times, The Independent and the Daily Telegraph also made clear that they would pay 
for stories, exceptionally, if they perceived there to be a clear public interest in the story in 
question. I accept that there may be many circumstances in which payments for information 
are justified in the public interest.

10.38  I also accept that payments for information may also be acceptable in the pursuit of pure 
entertainment  stories  or  diary  pages,  provided  that  the  publication  does  not  lead  to  the 
publication of fiction, and/or the breach of privacy (see below).It is essential that titles which 
choose  to  make  payments  for  stories  (whether  in  the  public  interest,  or  merely  because 
they interest the public) are fully aware of the risks involved, including the very real risks of 
providing an incentive for fabrication and/or exaggeration. It seems that at present, parts of 
the press are not sufficiently aware of those risks and do not seek to corroborate or check the 
stories published.

Providing an incentive for intrusions into private life

10.39  A further concern arising from the solicitation of stories for payment is that the practice provides 
an incentive for breaches of privacy. The “kiss and tell” is a prime example of this. While the 
evidence heard by the Inquiry suggested that traditional “kiss and tell” stories are declining, 
they are clearly not merely of historic interest and continue to appear in tabloid newspapers. 
Sometimes, these will involve breaches of privacy justified by the public interest,562 but other 
times they will not be so justified. What is clear is that the offer of payment by the individual 
titles is often a significant motivating factor for the (generally) women who sell their stories. 
The Inquiry also heard that the offer of payments to (generally) women involved in intimate 
relationship with well-known people can lead to conduct at least verging on the blackmail of 
those people: Mr Flitcroft said that one of the women with whom he was involved demanded 
£3,000 to keep quiet; a second woman demanded £5,000. One can only infer that those sums 
were close to the sums offered by the newspaper for their stories.563

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public10.40  In addition, the evidence emerging from the “medical records sting” in Chris Atkins’ Starsuckers 
(discussed above) supports the conclusion that the offer of payments for stories incentivises 
breaches of private life. Notable in that evidence was the discussion between Mr Atkins and 
a journalist from the Sunday People, in particular on how the private information could be 
used without revealing that it derived from medical records; the journalist suggested instead 
that a woman who had allegedly had a breast enlargement could be featured in a “silhouette 
spread” or a “have they, haven’t they story”. This causes some concern because it suggests 
that even information that a newspaper judges too private to publish in the form disclosed 
by the source may be used as the foundation for a different story, which is not based directly 
on the source material.

10.41  Further, as Steve Turner of the BPPA has noted, the request by some newspapers for readers 
to  send  photographs  of  people  in  the  public  eye,  in  return  for  payment,  has  led  to  the 
development of “amateur celebrity chasing paparazzi” or “stakerazzi”. As discussed above in 
Section 5 of this Chapter, this has caused significant invasions of privacy for many people in 
the public eye.

10.42  It is important to note that the payment for information about the private life of an individual 
may  not  always  be  unethical.  It  may  also  be  ethical  in  certain  circumstances  to  pay  for  a 
photographs provided by members of the public. I should make it absolutely clear that I am not 
advocating the banning of payments for information, even payments for private information. 
What concerns me is the degree to which some newspapers appear to rely on the provision 
of  private  information  to  fill  their  pages,  and  therefore  actively  encourage  the  disclosure 
of private information via eye-catching advertisements which offer monetary reward. This 
approach risks the wholesale disclosure of private information without consideration of the 
public interest in doing so. Even if the newspaper does not subsequently publish the disclosed 
information, the disclosure is itself a breach of privacy.

Conclusions

10.43  Plainly, there are circumstances where the making of payment for information for stories is 
clearly illegal as a matter of criminal law: the Bribery Act 2010 forbids the payments to public 
officials, and there is no defence based on actual or perceived public interest. The extent of 
such criminal activity is not a matter for this Inquiry given that it forms the basis of Operation 
Elveden.564

10.44  Beyond the specific confines of the Bribery Act, the paying of sources for information is not 
contrary to the criminal law (although it should be noted and underscored that the general 
principle  which  permits  the  protection  of  the  confidentiality  of  sources  does  not  justify 
paying money to a public official and then ‘protecting’ his or her identity), although it may 
often be unethical, for a number of clear and obvious reasons. First, the source may require 
payment  for  the  very  reason  that  he  or  she  has  obtained  the  information  in  question  by 
illegal, unethical or otherwise dubious means, and the payment is, as it were, the price for 
taking the risk. Second, the fact that a source apparently requires payment for supplying the 
information in question may well be an incentive for exaggeration and embellishment. Put 
another way, it is legitimate to argue that a source who provides information without seeking 
remuneration for it is more likely to be acting out of sound motives. Third, the offering of 
money for stories may well encourage members of the public to engage in intrusive methods 
in circumstances where there is no clear public interest.

564 Part E, Chapter 5

703

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFF

10.45  Overall, paying for information may be seen as increasing the risk of unethical if not illegal 
conduct  by  the  source  and,  in  consequence,  by  the  journalist  acting  on  the  information 
purchased. In order to reduce these risks to acceptable levels, if newspapers are to continue 
to offer payment for stories, at the very least what is required are clear and effective internal 
systems of accountability and reporting, together with an acute assessment of where the 
public interest lies. In large parts of the press, this does not appear to have been occurring.

11.	 Treatment	of	critics
11.1  The way in which an individual, an organisation, or an industry treats its critics can reveal 
a  lot  about  its  culture.  Openness  to  legitimate  criticism  is  the  hallmark  of  many  thriving 
organisations  and  industries.  By  contrast,  defensiveness  and  intimidation  in  response  to 
legitimate criticism tends to be a feature of closed-minded and entrenched industries. The 
phone hacking scandal as a whole revealed that large parts of the press tended to the latter: 
over the course of five years, much of the press showed a complete unwillingness to engage 
with those critics who pointed to evidence of unlawful and unethical practices within one 
newspaper, and to practices which are likely to have taken place in others too. Indeed, rather 
than  engaging  with  those  critics,  much  of  the  press  subjected  them  to  intense  scrutiny, 
occasionally amounting to intimidation.

11.2  The clearest example of this is the approach adopted by NI in response to high profile phone 
hacking  critics.  As  discussed  above,565  lawyers  bringing  claims  against  NI  were  subjected 
to  ongoing  surveillance,  commissioned  with  a  view  to  trying  to  force  them  to  remove 
themselves from the litigation. Similarly a member of the CMS Select Committee was placed 
under surveillance during its investigation of phone hacking. Mr Webb confirmed that he was 
instructed to place Tom Watson MP under surveillance for a period of a week, trying to prove 
an alleged affair (which was not in fact taking place) in order to pressure Mr Watson to step 
back from the phone hacking issue. Another member of the Select Committee Mr Bryant, 
told  the  Inquiry of  his  experience of  direct intimidation.  In  early 2011 he  was  called  by a 
friend who informed him that two people close to Rupert Murdoch had warned that it would 
be wise for Mr Bryant to desist from the phone hacking investigations, or Mr Murdoch would 
“get him, in time”. While there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that Mr Murdoch had 
in fact made any threats, there is no reason to doubt that a phone call between Mr Bryant 
and his friend took place and that something which could be construed as a threat purporting 
to be from Mr Murdoch was passed on. Mr Bryant said that further threats were passed on 
in March 2011.566

11.3  Mr Grant, who was seen as a figurehead of the Hacked Off campaign, was also the subject of 
threats. The mother of his child was called by an anonymous caller when he was on television 
discussing the phone hacking issue and told to “Tell Hugh Grant to shut the fuck up!”567

11.4  These examples of surveillance and intimidation in the context of the phone hacking scandal 
are particularly egregious. It seems clear that certain people within the NoTW, or, perhaps, 
unsought supporters, were determined to prevent many of the facts discussed at elsewhere568 
Chapter 4 from being revealed, and so resorted to deeply unethical methods to prevent that 
from happening. However, although the evidence as a whole did not suggest that the use

704

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicof direct threats and the like by the press was commonplace, the limited evidence of those 
methods in the context of the phone hacking scandal was consistent with evidence given by 
a number of the Core Participants complaining of press misconduct, who spoke to a general 
atmosphere of intimidation by parts of the press. The evidence of that atmosphere came 
in two forms: first, evidence of the press launching direct personal attacks on critics; and 
second, evidence from a wide range of witnesses of a failure to speak out or criticise, litigate, 
or seek assistance from the regulator, for fear of the personal consequences.

11.5  The Inquiry saw numerous examples of parts of the press adopting attack as the best form 
of defence against critics. When Mr Peppiatt resigned from the Daily Star and published his 
resignation letter in the Guardian, he was subjected to a campaign of harassment and threats. 
He received phone calls and text messages telling him, for instance, he was “a marked man 
until the day you die”, or “RD will get you”, which he understood to be a reference to Daily Star 
proprietor Richard Desmond: again, there is no evidence that Mr Desmond was personally 
responsible  for  any  such  communication.  An  individual  with  long  established  links  to  the 
tabloid world has apparently been warned by the police in connection with the harassment 
of Mr Peppiatt.569

11.6  A more conventional example of the attack by a newspaper of a critic is the Daily Mail’s story 
about Mr Grant and his alleged ‘mendacious smears’, which is discussed in detail above.570 
That article followed several others attacking and criticising Mr Grant, partly in relation to 
his role as spokesperson for Hacked Off. One prime example included an ad hominem attack 
par  excellence:  the  article  sought  to  undermine  Mr  Grant’s  arguments  in  favour  of  press 
regulation by attacking his character, describing him as an “oleaginous, womanising lounge-
lizard” who was a “lonely, bitter man consumed with hatred of the media who helped make 
him a star”.571 Similar articles were written to discredit Mr Coogan’s arguments in favour of 
press reform.572

11.7  The Sun’s response to Mr Brown’s allegation that the newspaper had unlawfully accessed his 

son’s medical records was a further example of attack as defence.573

11.8  Witnesses who had pursued litigation against newspaper titles gave evidence that parts of 
the  press  sought  retribution  against  those  who  brought  claims  against  a  newspaper  title. 
Mr Thomson, said that a successful action invariably led to retribution. He explained:574

“I’ve acted for Naomi Campbell, Loreena McKennitt, Sienna Miller at the time she 
was complaining she was chastised for complaining, for whingeing about her privacy. 
Max Mosley was – every possible claimant, whether it’s a footballer, they have all 
been chastised for complaining, for going to law to get remedies, and it’s a sort of 
tactic to undermine their vindication by trashing the claimant.
…  Of  course  they  can  comment  on  the  judicial  process  in  the  sense  of,  “Oh,  well, 
I  don’t  think  that  injunction  should  have  been  granted”,  but  –  this  is  my  opinion,

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFmy suspicion is: well, if they go to law, we’ll give them a good trashing and it will 
deter other people from doing the same. That’s my view about the strategy behind it 
because it happens, as I said, almost invariably. Let’s make it difficult for them, let’s 
deter others, let’s trash them and maybe other people will think long and hard about 
doing it in future.”

11.9  Mr  Shear  gave  similar  evidence  in  relation  to  one  of  his  clients  who  had  sued  for  libel  in 
respect of allegations of homosexual activity. Having succeeded in the libel action, the client 
became a target of interest for the newspaper and the victim of what Mr Shear described as 
“a revenge-fuelled fervour”, and a determination to prove something that was damaging to 
his reputation or to his private life as part of “the quid pro quo of having the temerity to take 
on the national media in those circumstances.”575

11.10  Ms Rowling gave an example of what might be thought of as small-scale retribution by the 
press.  In  2005,  she  had  complained  to  the  PCC  in  respect  of  the  Daily  Mirror  publishing 
her  address.  A  matter  of  five  days  after  the  complaint  was  made,  the  Mirror  published  a 
photograph  of  Ms  Rowling’s  daughter  as  a  baby,  despite  the  fact  it  was  well  known  that 
she was fiercely protective of her children’s privacy and objected to the publication of their 
photographs. Her view was that the Daily Mirror’s decision to publish the photograph was a 
deliberate act of spite in response to her complaint.576

F

11.11  Mr Mosley provided a considerably larger scale example when describing the course of his 
privacy litigation against the NoTW. In response to Mr Mosley’s application for an injunction 
to prevent (re)publication of the offending article and video, and while awaiting judgment, 
the NoTW splashed another front page article concerning the events in question under the 
heading “MY NAZI ORGY WITH FI BOSS”. Further, for reasons which to my mind could never 
do them credit (whatever other justification might be advanced), the NoTW sent a copy of 
the video to Formula 1 bosses, presumably in what transpired to be an unsuccessful attempt 
to get Mr Mosley dismissed from his position.577

11.12  In the light of behaviour of this sort, it is not, perhaps, surprising that a number of witnesses 
gave evidence to the effect that they avoided litigation or complaints: it seems that many 
people in the public eye would rather endure breaches of privacy or small libels than conduct 
litigation, face the repetition of the offending story and endure the aggressive press response 
that comes from it.

11.13  Mr Grant said to the Inquiry: “to speak out and criticise is to invite a terrible press storm on your 
head”.578 As a consequence, his evidence was that he had avoided litigating or complaining 
about unethical press practices, except in the most serious cases. Mr Coogan gave similar 
evidence. He said:579

“if you stick your head above the parapet or you criticise the papers or you make 
a point of taking action, then they’ll come after you, you know. Insofar as my legal 
action is concerned, I was – I was advised by my publicists that – they actually said

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicto me, “Do you –” When I was considering taking action against News International, 
my publicists said to me, “Do you really want to make enemies of these people?” By 
implication – well, the inference being that if – and when I asked them to elaborate, 
they said, “Well, in the future if they decide to run another story, we can use it as a 
bargaining chip. We can say that you could have taken legal action and you didn’t, 
therefore why don’t you drop the story?” But when they said “these people”, they 
meant that – the inference was clear, that if you make life difficult for them, they will 
use their newspapers as a weapon against you.”

11.14  Ms Church580 and Ms Gascoigne581 had, for significant periods, adopted the same approach, 
avoiding litigation and avoiding complaint except in the most serious circumstances, in order 
to avoid the aggressive and unpleasant response with which a complaint would be met. Ms 
Church’s evidence indicated that aggressive attacks have a corollary: preferential treatment 
for those who cooperate with newspapers. She recalled that when she was asked to sing at 
Rupert Murdoch’s wedding in 1999, her manager was offered the choice between $100,000, 
or no fee but favourable treatment in the NI press. Her manager advised her to accept no 
fee.582

11.15  The evidence as a whole highlighted a point I made during the course of the Inquiry. The 
press are in a unique position as they carry a very large megaphone: if people cooperate, 
that megaphone can be used to enhance careers; for those who complain or challenge titles, 
the  megaphone  can  be  used  to  destroy  them.  Whereas  complainants  or  litigants  against 
individual  titles  have  a  limited  forum  to  air  their  complaints,  the  press  have  a  ready  and 
captive  audience  of  hundreds  of  thousands  if  not  millions  of  readers  who  will  read  their 
response. As a former NoTW news editor noted in an unguarded moment, the megaphone 
can be used to “destroy people’s lives”.583

11.16  Evidence  of  aggressive  attacks  on  press  critics,  and  self-censorship  by  potential  critics, 
extended beyond the celebrity world and into the judicial and political field as well. In response 
to the Max Mosley judgment, a number of tabloid newspapers launched an aggressive and 
personal  campaign  against  the  judge  in  the  case,  Mr  Justice  Eady.584  In  his  speech  to  the 
Society of Editors, Mr Dacre described his judgments as “arrogant and amoral” and criticised 
his “subjective and highly relativist moral sense”.585 Although Mr Dacre stated that he had 
attacked the judgments and not the man,586 some might be forgiven for reading the speech 
differently, particularly when reading it alongside Daily Mail articles such as, ‘As cold as a

582 By letter received 18 October 2012, Charlotte Church’s then manager wrote to the Inquiry challenging this account 
of the facts in order to restore his own ‘unblemished professional reputation in the face of the continual aspersions 
cast upon it’. Said to have been prompted by an article on 5 October 2012, it is surprising that he did not do so after 
the evidence was first given (28 November 2011) when it may well have been appropriate to allow the matter to be 
ventilated further. As it is, Ms Church does not accept the account provided by Professor Shalit and I am not in a position 
to take the matter further. The Report consists of a review and an analysis of the evidence which was given, rather than

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFfrozen haddock, Mr Justice Eady hands down his views shorn of moral balance...’.587 The key 
point, it seems to me, is that if Mr Dacre and others had a strong objection to the development 
of  protection  of  a  right  to  privacy  in  UK  law,  they  were  perfectly  entitled  to  express  that 
objection in forceful terms. But by directing the rhetorical fire at an individual judge who 
was seeking to apply the principles set down by higher courts and whose judgments were 
capable of challenge on appeal, that objection takes on the appearance of being aggressive 
and intimidating. Furthermore, it was an attack to which, by judicial convention, Mr Justice 
Eady was unable to respond.

11.17  Similarly  intimidating  and  aggressive  attacks  have  been  directed  at  politicians  who  have 
criticised aspects of the press. Rather than engaging with the arguments made by the critics, 
parts of the press have engaged in ad hominem attacks. A prime example is the treatment of 
critics of Page 3 who have been labelled variously as “fat”, “ugly” “harridan”, “battleaxe” and 
“jealous of beautiful women”. Their arguments have been described as “potty”, “senseless” 
and “furious rants”.588

11.18  However,  the  preponderance  of  evidence  suggests  that  overt  intimidation  of  politicians 
by the press is rare. What is far more widespread is a self-restraint by politicians fearful of 
criticising the press. The evidence received from a number of politician witnesses indicated 
that fear of press attack was a significant factor in the failure of successive Governments to 
tackle the issue of press behaviour, notwithstanding a recognition that better regulation was 
required. This is discussed in greater detail elsewhere, but for the purposes of this chapter it 
worth noting Lord Mandelson’s view that the Blair and Brown Governments were ‘cowed’ by 
the power of the press and the threat of a hostile response to any attempts to address press 
regulation.589 The Rt Hon Ed Miliband agreed that fear played a significant part in the failure 
to address press regulation during the Blair and Brown years.590 When Mr Blair attempted to 
articulate his concerns about some aspects of the culture of the press in a speech delivered 
prior to his departure from office,591 the almost universally critical press response, including 
a number of personally directed attacks, appeared to confirm those fears.592 As Mr Paxman 
noted in his MacTaggart lecture in the same year:593

“…I thought the way we responded to Tony Blair’s speech was pretty pathetic. Again, 
let’s be frank. These two trades, politics and media have a great deal in common. 
Both deal in words and images, both involve a contract with the public based upon 
fairly explicit promises…
By and large, the response to Blair’s attack just pressed the F12 key. Yah booh. You’re 
a politician. We’re media yahoos. Get over it.”

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public11.19  Assessed  as  a  whole,  it  is  appropriate  to  conclude  from  the  evidence  that  a  practice  has 
existed within parts of the press, at certain times and in certain circumstances, of seeking to 
intimidate or seek retribution against complainants and critics. While that approach may not 
have been widespread, it has been sufficiently prevalent to create a generalised fear amongst 
those in the public eye of criticising or challenging the press owing to concerns about personal 
attack and vilification. I repeat that the press is entitled to hold whatever opinions it wishes 
and, subject to defamation, is equally entitled to express them: it cannot complain, however, 
if the inference is drawn that this practice is a form of special pleading and that the attack 
follows a challenge to the way in which they go about their business.

12.  Complaints handling
12.1  An issue related to the way in which the press treats critics is the manner in which it deals 
with  those  who  make  complaints  in  relation  to  specific  stories.  The  Inquiry  heard  a  great 
deal of evidence of good practice on this issue, in particular in relation to the use of readers’ 
editors  at  a  number  of  titles.  But  there  was  also  substantial  evidence  of  poor  practice, 
showing first, that the complaints process can be (sometimes, it was thought, deliberately) 
protracted, complicated and expensive; second that there is a strong reluctance in parts of 
the press to apologise even when it is not in dispute that a story was incorrect; and third, 
that apologies, retractions and corrections are frequently given substantially less prominence 
than  the offending  article and  therefore fail  to satisfy those who are aggrieved. Although 
evidence was heard on these issues from many witnesses, I focus only on three examples 
which I treat as case studies: the identity of the titles concerned is not to the point.

12.2  The  first  example  was  the  response  of  a  number  of  newspapers  to  complaints  made  by 
the  McCanns  in  light  of  defamatory  reporting  of  the  circumstances  of  their  daughter’s 
disappearance.594 Although some of the narrative has already been described,595 it bears brief 
repetition here. In September 2007, the McCanns’ solicitor Angus McBride met with all the 
editors of the national newspapers to convey the McCanns’ concerns about the defamatory 
reporting of Madeleine’s disappearance and the harmful impact this reporting was having 
on the search for her. That first meeting appeared to have no effect and, after continuing 
libellous  reporting  by  a  number  of  daily  newspapers,  further  meetings  were  arranged 
between Mr McBride, Clarence Mitchell and the editors responsible. Those further meetings 
also appeared to have no effect and the defamatory reporting continued. On 26 September 
2007, a solicitors’ letter threatening libel proceedings was sent to those newspapers which 
appeared to be the worst offenders. That letter, and a further letter sent on 10 October 2007, 
appeared to have no impact on the continuing libellous reporting.596

12.3 

In January 2008, the McCanns’ representatives sent a formal letter before action in advance 
of a libel claim to both the Daily Express and the Daily Star newspapers. Notwithstanding the 
fact that the newspapers were aware they had no clear factual basis for any of the libellous 
stories published,597 the Express Group wrote that they were not willing to publish an apology 
for the libels, but were willing to offer the McCanns a “platform” to tell their side of the story, 
and offered them an exclusive interview and photo-shoot with OK! Magazine. Unsurprisingly, 
the McCanns rejected the (astonishingly misjudged) offer. As Dr Gerry McCann wrote:598

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF“I  found  it  simply  breathtaking  that  they  would  think  it  appropriate  to  offer  us 
interviews or other coverage in their own newspapers that they would subsequently 
make  money  from,  as  an  appropriate  remedy  for  the  distress  and  hurt  they  had 
caused.”

12.4  Although  the  Express  Group  subsequently  published  what  they  described  as  an 
“unprecedented” front page apology to the McCanns, that was not matched by their apology 
to  the  friends  of  the  McCanns  who  had  also  been  falsely  accused  (on  the  front  page)  of 
covering up the truth about Madeleine’s disappearance: their apology in the Daily Express 
was found on page five.

12.5  The McCanns also brought proceedings against Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL), on the basis 
of defamatory coverage in the Evening Standard and Daily Mail. The claim was settled with 
a substantial payment to the Find Madeleine fund, and an apology in the Evening Standard. 
The Daily Mail offered the McCanns free advertising for the Find Madeleine fund, but refused 
to apologise essentially on the basis that the defamatory stories published by the title had 
been  balanced  with  a  number  of  favourable  reports  about  the  McCanns.  Unsurprisingly, 
the  McCanns  were  disappointed  by  the  newspaper’s  stance,  but  chose  not  to  continue  a 
protracted dispute.599

12.6  The  second  example  of  poor  practice  in  responding  to  complaints  is  Neil  Morrissey’s 
experience of a complaint against the Daily Mail.600 On 19 March 2011, the Daily Mail had 
published an article alleging that Mr Morrissey had been banned from a pub in France for 
drunken and rowdy behaviour. The story was untrue, the Daily Mail had been told in advance 
of publication that it was untrue, and the Daily Mail eventually accepted it was untrue and 
apologised. But the process leading to that apology was unnecessarily protracted.

F

12.7  On  23  March  2011,  immediately  after  publication,  Mr  Morrissey’s  lawyers  wrote  to  ANL 
stating that if an immediate apology and retraction were published, no claim for damages 
would  be  issued.  That  letter  and  a  subsequent  one  went  unanswered  for  a  month.  ANL 
eventually replied on 21 April 2011 refusing to publish an apology or retraction even though 
it appears that they did not claim in terms that the story was true, insisting instead that the 
story presented Mr Morrissey “in a sympathetic light”.

12.8  Mr Morrissey issued a libel claim on 21 June 2011. A further six weeks passed before, on 5 
August 2011, the Daily Mail accepted that the story was untrue and made an offer of amends. 
Although ANL claim that it was only then that it became clear that the story was untrue,601 it 
is difficult to understand why it took almost five months to reach this conclusion.

12.9  Once the Daily Mail accepted its error, the parties entered negotiations to agree the format 
and placement of an apology. The original article was published on page 19, took up a full 
page of the Daily Mail, was around 600 words long and included four large photographs. Mr 
Morrissey originally requested a 160 word apology under its own headline, but entered into 
negotiations with the Daily Mail over wording.602 After six weeks of negotiations, the Daily 
Mail published a 67 word unilateral apology on its “corrections and clarifications” column on

710

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicpage 2.603 Mr Morrissey complained that this apology did not have anything approaching the 
same prominence as the offending article.

12.10  The  Inquiry  heard  evidence  from  a  number  of  witnesses  with  regard  to  correction  and 
clarification columns and their benefits and disadvantages. Although I accept that there are 
significant benefits, a legitimate criticism that needs to be addressed is how to distinguish an 
apology for defamation or breach of privacy from simple factual corrections or clarifications. 
The apology to Mr Morrissey was published alongside a correction of the price paid by the 
NHS per loaf of gluten-free bread, and it seems reasonable in that context for Mr Morrissey 
to complain that the placement of the apology devalued it. In my view, an apology should 
at  least  be  headlined  with  “apology”  or  “sorry”  or  something  to  clearly  mark  it  out  as 
something distinct from a simple factual correction. In the absence of such a clear marker, it 
is unsurprising that some witnesses inferred that newspapers seek to bury their apologies.

12.11  The third example was provided by the organisation Carbon Brief, and evidences an inadequate 
response to complaints of inaccuracies that harm the public interest.604 Carbon Brief noted 
a series of articles in the Daily Mail which suggested that there was an average £200 “green 
tax” on household energy bills, which accounted for 20% of total household energy costs. The 
claim was inaccurate (the best accurate figure was around £80 or 8%), but was being used to 
justify a number of opinion pieces critical of the government’s green agenda. Carbon Brief 
was concerned that the error fed into the Mail’s “editorial line on the matter, which can be 
summarised as a campaigning stance against green policies to encourage renewable power 
or energy efficiency”.605

12.12  Immediately after publication, Carbon Brief wrote to the Daily Mail to identify the error, but 
received no response. A subsequent complaint to the PCC was defended by the Daily Mail 
by reference to a 2008 report by the think-tank Civitas. However, that report did not in fact 
support the Daily Mail’s £200 or 20% claim. Accordingly, the Daily Mail published a correction 
some three months after the claim had first appeared, and after it had been repeated many 
times in other titles.606

12.13  That  was  not  the  end  of  the  matter.  Less  than  two  weeks  after  the  correction  had  been 
published, the 20% claim was repeated in the Mail on Sunday. Carbon Brief wrote to the Mail 
on Sunday to identify the error but, once again, received no response. Carbon Brief therefore 
made a second complaint to the PCC. Pending the resolution of that complaint, and despite 
the fact the Mail on Sunday was aware of both the PCC complaint and the previous correction 
in the Daily Mail, it published a further article making the same claim, saying that “the country 
is overrun with wind farms and energy costs are skyrocketing, with green stealth taxes adding 
15  to  20  per  cent  to  the  average  domestic  power  bill.”  The  Mail  on  Sunday  subsequently 
published a correction, but then, two months later, once again repeated the claim.607

12.14  Carbon Brief summarised its complaint in the following bullet points:608

•  “This has been a time consuming and involved process, over a fairly straightforward 

factual inaccuracy.

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressF•  The MoS repeated a figure that had already been corrected twice while there was 

a PCC complaint about the figure with the paper.

•  Despite  two  successful  PCC  complaints  about  a  specific  statistic  and  published 
corrections  in  both  the  Mail  and  the  Mail  on  Sunday,  the  Mail  group  are  still 
repeating the figure.

•  Either the Mail group’s internal processes for noting complaints are inadequate, or 

they do not take PCC negotiated corrections seriously.”

12.15  To those bullet points might be added a fifth point, namely that complaints to the PCC would 
never have been required had the titles replied to the original letters sent by Carbon Brief 
direct  to  the  newspapers.  Accordingly,  the  example  raises  concerns  about  the  ability,  or 
willingness, of some newspaper titles to respond to complaints made direct to the newspaper 
by readers. Sensibly, most complaints should be resolved at that level without the need to 
refer a complaint to the regulatory body. But the Carbon Brief example suggests that, in some 
cases,  some  newspapers  ignore  complaints  entirely,  or  delay  in  responding  for  significant 
periods, until the regulator, or the courts, are involved.

12.16  The three examples above provide evidence of each of the three specific concerns raised by 
witnesses in relation to inadequate complaint handling by parts of the press: i) the delay and 
expense of bringing a complaint, ii) the reluctance of parts of the press to apologise or correct 
errors, and iii) the failure to give due prominence to apologies and corrections.

F

Unnecessary delay and over-complication of the complaints process

12.17  Full  Fact  provided  the  Inquiry  with  evidence  of  all  three  issues.  In  relation  to  the  delay 
occasioned  by  parts  of  the  press  when  dealing  with  complaints,  Full  Fact  suggested  that 
some newspapers deliberately complicate and draw out the complaints process as a tactic 
to avoid making apologies and corrections. They wrote that “little effort is made on the part 
of  newspapers  to  avoid  making  the  process  extremely  awkward  and  time  consuming  for 
complainants”.609 610 Will Moy spoke of their regular experience as follows:611

“Where the first offer you get is, “We’ll amend the headline online only”. Then you 
get the offer of “We’ll print a letter from Full Fact disagreeing with our article but we 
won’t change the article or admit there was anything wrong with it”. Then you get 
page 12, then you get page 6, then you get page 4, then you get page 2. All of this, 
rounds and rounds of correspondence, weeks between them, takes forever, deeply 
tiring. And all of this, of course, after the actual inaccuracy has been accepted.”

12.18  A specific example of apparently deliberate awkwardness was Full Fact’s evidence that on 
three  occasions,  after  a  long  process  of  negotiating  agreed  corrections,  and  after  having 
reached agreement, the Daily Mail had contacted the PCC to seek changes to the agreement 
on the night before publication. The organisation noted:612

609 p9, ibid
610 Mr Moy overstates the position in suggesting that this is standard practice within newspapers. The Inquiry has 
received much evidence to contrary effect: see, for example, the decision of the Court of Appeal in KC v MGN Ltd 
[2012] EWCA Civ 1382 and the earlier decision of Eady J in Bowman v NGN [2010] EWHC 858 (QB)

712

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public“This  means  unilaterally  reopening  the  complaints  process  on  an  evening  before 
publication, when complainants may not be in a position to respond immediately. 
Indeed, this means demanding a response time from the complainant that we never 
receive from newspapers themselves.
That  this  has  been  done  on  three  separate  occasions  over  four  complaints  to  our 
knowledge, all by the same newspaper and not just to Full Fact, gives such moves the 
impression of a considered tactic to disrupt the process.”

12.19  Although it is not necessary to reach a conclusion as to whether the Daily Mail’s approach 
on the three occasions cited was part of a deliberate tactic, the simple fact is that it is part 
of a general tendency within parts of the press to delay and complicate what ought to be a 
reasonably simple process of prompt correction and apology. Mr Snow gave evidence of what 
he considered was unnecessary argument with ANL over the precise format of an apology to 
be published after he had been defamed. He said:613

“The confession was that it was completely untrue and they accepted it was untrue 
and they retracted it and apologised. The apology was 1.5 inches by a column and 
then the wrestling was over whether there should be a photograph of me above it. 
They didn’t want the photograph because that would draw attention to the apology. 
Actually, in the end, we got the photograph, but I mean, this is pathetic. Wrestling 
over 1.5 inches when you have had five pages of something which the paper itself 
deems untrue? That is not the way forward…
That is the process we have at the moment. That is justice; that is the way any reader 
who – or any person offended by a paper who has something wrong gets redress.”

Reluctance to publish corrections and/or apologies, even where error is clear

12.20  In relation to a reluctance within some titles to publish apologies and/or corrections, Full 
Fact’s  ‘churnalism’  project  was  instructive.614  Along  with  Mr  Atkins,  Full  Fact  published  a 
number of fictional press releases that were adopted and published by newspapers without 
sufficient  checking.  One,  published  in  the  Metro,  told  of  a  fictional  stammerer  who  had 
decided to undergo unorthodox speech therapy to cure his stammer in time for Valentine’s 
Day. Another, published by the Daily Mail on the basis of a Facebook page, reported claims 
that the Prime Minister’s new cat was actually stolen from a council estate in South London. 
Full Fact informed the newspapers that they had published hoax stories but both refused to 
publish corrections or clarifications, despite extensive correspondence. Full Fact noted:615

“… it once again raises the question of why newspapers are so adversarial on the 
issue of acknowledging errors at all. It is extremely rare for us to submit a complaint 
about a significant factual inaccuracy that is not initially dismissed by the paper.
Even in cases where papers have been indisputably wrong (such as over a basic error 
leading to stories reporting life expectancy on a Merthyr Tydfil estate was lower than 
in Haiti) several rounds of correspondence over several weeks have been required to 
get a worthwhile correction printed.

615 p8, ibid

713

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFOne of the problems at the heart the issue is not that papers get their facts wrong or 
indeed borrow heavily from press releases, but an unwillingness to acknowledge and 
act on the problems that may arise as a consequence.
Given the time and resource pressures in the media it is inevitable that mistakes get 
made, so why not be more willing to acknowledge and correct them when they are 
pointed out?
Perhaps it would make the embarrassment from these kind of hoaxes a little easier 
to swallow.”

Lack of due prominence

12.21  The  identification  of  a  reluctance  to  publish  apologies  and/or  corrections  feeds  into  the 
third issue identified: lack of due prominence when an apology or correction is made. Full 
Fact616 and the Media Standards Trust617 gave evidence on this point. Considered together 
their evidence suggests that it is extremely difficult to find any adjudications, apologies or 
corrections that are given equal prominence as the offending article. It is of course correct 
that “equal prominence” is not what is required by the Editors’ Code, but it is also clear that 
what parts of the press consider to be “due prominence” is not the same as what victims of 
inaccuracies, defamations and breaches of privacy consider it to be.

12.22  Ms Mills,618 Ms Gascoigne,619 Ms Miller,620 Mr Coogan,621 Mr Snow622 and Ms Diamond623 all 
spoke of the insufficient prominence with which apologies were published after complaints 
of  breach  of  privacy  or  libel.  They  were  consistent  in  complaining  that  corrections  or 
apologies were nowhere near as prominent as offending articles and noted that the damage 
to  reputation  or  privacy  caused  by  a  front  page  splash,  or  full  page  article,  could  not  be 
remedied  by  the  publication  of  a  two  inch  apology  within  a  corrections  and  clarifications

12.23  Exemplifying this problem was The Sun’s editor’s evidence (supplemented by a further letter 
to the Inquiry on behalf of the Sun)624 in relation to a PCC adjudication relating to The Sun’s 
article entitled “Boy, 12, turns into girl”. The article was held by the PCC to be inaccurate 
and a breach of the girl’s privacy. The original article had appeared on the front page of the 
newspaper, with a further full page on page 5. The adjudication was published on page 6, at 
the request of The Sun and agreed by the PCC, in a narrow column on the right of the page, 
adjacent to an eye catching article headlined “£1m Baby P Bungle”. That the adjudication was 
published further back in the newspaper than the article was directly contradictory to Mr 
Mohan’s written evidence, where he had written: “Corrections are never placed further back

where the correction is published on page two”.625 Nonetheless, Mr Mohan appeared to defend 
the prominence claiming that it was one of the longest adjudications ever published.626 That 
may be so, but if Mr Mohan was claiming the publication of this particular adjudication as an 
example of due prominence, that causes significant concern.

12.24  Mr Blair’s evidence indicated the potential importance of due prominence in correcting errors 
in political reporting. He recalled the front page vehemence with which parts of the press 
had attacked Lord Mandelson’s alleged lies in relation to the Hinduja passport scandal and 
compared that vehemence to the relative lack of publicity given to the subsequent official 
report which cleared Lord Mandelson of any wrongdoing.627

12.25  Although some editors and journalists resisted the suggestion that apologies and corrections 
were “buried” within newspapers, a number accepted that there was at least a perception 
that this was the case. Rebekah Brooks noted that, in her experience, “correcting inaccuracies 
does not cost a great deal for the press, but it is given low priority and minimal projection” and 
she accepted that the NI newspapers were as much at fault for this as others.628 She said:629

“one of the biggest complaints I used to get, not necessarily about my own newspaper 
but about the press in general, was the prominence of apologies when an inaccuracy 
had taken place… The page 37, one paragraph type thing.”

12.26  In light of Mrs Brooks’ evidence, it was somewhat ironic that James Murdoch complained of 

a lack of prominence of apologies in articles concerning NI. He said:630

“Look, I think it’s – you know, I have personal opinions about this, and actually, as 
the subject of a lot of press coverage over the last year myself, to be honest, I’ve 
had cause for reflection, and I have been concerned with things like the ability to 
make a case, the ability to reply. I have been concerned with things like prominence 
of  corrections.  The  Guardian  alone  I  think  has  had  to  correct  stories  about  News 
Corporation  over 40 times in the last ten months or so, none of which seemed to 
have the same prominence as the original story, and that worries me. I think clearly 
it shows that somewhere in that code strengthening needs to occur with respect to 
accuracy and creating accountability there, but you know, I think this is going to be a 
matter for this Inquiry and for the industry.”

12.27  Former PCC Chairman Sir Christopher Meyer acknowledged that during his tenure between 
2003-2007  there  was  a  problem  ensuring  that  corrections  and  apologies  were  given  due 
prominence; his view was that the problem remained today. In large part, he accepted that 
the problem lay with the fact that the PCC had no power to direct where corrections and 
apologies should appear, and no power to direct their size and prominence.631

Chapter 6 | Criticisms of the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the PressFConclusion

12.28  Looking at the evidence in the round, it appears that parts of the press have adopted an 
adversarial approach to complaints, whereby even when clear errors have been identified, 
there has been a failure to provide swift and complete remedies to complainants. Plainly, 
there are common themes here with the section of the Report addressed to the treatment of 
critics [see section 11 above]. Parts of the press have, at times, sought to avoid corrections and 
apologies and have sought to minimise the prominence of those corrections and apologies. 
I agree with Sir Christopher Meyer that any new regulator must address this issue and must 
have  the  power  to  order  editors  where,  when,  and  how  they  should  publish  apologies, 
retractions, corrections and/or adjudications.

Introduction
The  foregoing  review  of  just  a  representative  sample  of  the  vast  quantity  of  evidence 
submitted to and considered by the Inquiry has served to identify a real problem within the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press. In setting out this evidence at some length I have 
provided my own evaluation of it, but I believe that I have done so in such a way that anyone 
reading this Report with care will be able to reach his or her own view.

I need to re-emphasise a point which I have already made more than once. There is a difference 
between saying that there is a real problem within the press (including a section of the press) 
on the one hand and saying that this problem is so widespread that it infects the majority 
of press practice on the other. I am not saying the latter. The unethical practices to which 
the evidence points afflict only a section of the press, and even then not for the majority of 
the time. Furthermore, in cases where the relevant section of the press has been identified, 
I am not to be understood as criticising all desks or departments within any individual title, 
still less the majority of journalists working there. The evidence points to a less sweeping 
conclusion, but one which is nonetheless a cause for significant concern. Although unethical 
practices have been perpetrated by or within some parts of some titles only for some of the 
time, the coverage or strength of the evidence I have read, seen and heard is more than 
sufficient to indicate the presence of a culture (or sub-culture – the precise terminology does 
not matter) which subsists and needs to be addressed.

The term ‘culture’, and the approach I should adopt, has been subjected to lengthy analysis 
and critique in some of the submissions the Inquiry has received. I have considered all of 
these submissions with great care. Whereas this Report is hardly the place for an in depth 
sociological debate into the meaning of complex terms, my approach may be simply stated. 
I have focused in particular on unethical practices: these fall four-square within my Terms 
of  Reference.  My  conclusions  as  to  an  unethical  culture,  or  sub-culture,  flowing  from  the 
identification  of  such  practices  are  necessarily  inferential.  The  evidence  has  very  often 
demonstrated  the  existence  of  identical  practices  in  more  than  one  title,  and  on  many 
occasions across several titles. The prevalence of such practices will vary as between titles, 
and the Inquiry has in any event largely avoided an attempt to carry out a quantitative as 
opposed to a qualitative evaluation. But what this Inquiry has focused on throughout is the 
presence of practices which are more than isolated, coincidental or accidental both within 
individual titles and, viewing the matter more widely, a relevant section of the press. In other 
words, evidence of a culture within a title, or a part of a title, which is common to, similar, or 
identical within another title, or part of another title, can be regarded as evidence of a culture 
within a section of a press; and, furthermore, of a problem which needs to be addressed (not 
least by the provision of an appropriate regulator) by the press as a whole.

1.4 

Another highly relevant factor is that it is not too difficult to discern common themes and 
patterns within the categories of unethical conduct described and evidenced earlier.1 These 
categories  are  already  to  some  extent  artificial,  and  they  undoubtedly  overlap.  Take  the 
example of phone hacking. True, it is illegal, and many forms of subterfuge are not; but on 
analysis it shares much in common with other forms of unethical conduct which the Inquiry 

1 Part F, Chapter 6

717

F1.5

1.6 

1.7 

has examined. Surveillance of targets in search of a story full of prurient details but devoid 
of public interest, and the blagging of information to support a similar sort of story, are in 
essence not vastly different in moral – as opposed to technological – terms from listening 
into a voicemail in pursuit of similar tittle-tattle. Furthermore, hovering above all of these 
practices are additional matters of commonality: in particular, a failure to respect the personal 
autonomy  of  individuals,  and  a  concomitant  tendency  to  treat  celebrities  in  particular  as 
objects  rather  than  as  individuals,  because  they  have  ‘sold’  any  entitlement  to  privacy;  a 
tendency to regard the public interest as a form of trump card, on the basis that the work 
newspapers do is right, because they are surrogates for their readers and are exercising the 
right to free speech; and, in more extreme cases, a propensity to regard journalism as above 
the law, because newspapers are the ultimate guardians of both free speech and the public 
interest.

On this approach, one may even more readily detect a problem, in the form of a collection of 
similar practices, which may fairly be described as cultural. Plainly, my approach is somewhat 
in contrast with the thesis that some have advanced that the real problem within the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press is, or rather was, that of phone hacking which is therefore 
sui generis or ‘special’, and peculiar to one (now defunct) title. Some go even further, and 
have sought to argue that current police investigations into phone hacking and other criminal 
conduct  have  been  unfair  and  disproportionate.  For  reasons  which,  by  now,  I  have  made 
crystal clear, I totally reject these forms of special pleading. They ignore the evidence the 
Inquiry has received and, in their most extreme form, come close to suggesting that journalists 
should not be subject to the rule of law. But in my view there is no more precious principle in 
a mature democracy.

Those reading the whole of Part F of this Report may be forgiven for thinking that the pages 
covering good practice are far outnumbered by those covering the bad. I have already made 
the point that it would be a gross error to measure my assessment of the press in terms of 
the number of words expended. It is in the nature of public inquiries to investigate areas 
of public concern and adduce detailed evidence to enable those areas to be probed. The 
preponderance of good practice within the press, including those sections of the press which 
have been the focus of criticism, has been recognised by most of the witnesses who have 
testified; it also chimes with my own experience. This statement requires more than mere 
recognition;  it deserves explanation and elaboration, and the Chapter above meets these 
pre-requisites.2

I have already exempted the regional press from the generality of my findings, but I should 
address the position of magazines. In their submissions to the Inquiry, News International 
(NI) invited me to desegregate magazines from newspapers for this purpose on the basis that 
there is no evidence that they share a common culture, practices and ethics. A number of 
publishers of magazines have addressed this issue more directly, and have pointed out that 
the  pressures  on  magazines  are  somewhat  distinct  from  those  operating  on  newspapers: 
they are published less frequently, and there is less of a call for the eye-catching headline 
or  the  sensationalised  story,  as  one  such  publisher  put  it  to  me.  Additionally,  the  Inquiry 
only heard from three magazine editors and their evidence was confined to the admittedly 
important issues of celebrity, intrusion, breaches of privacy, and harassment by paparazzi. 
Some of this evidence did not place these magazines in an altogether favourable light, and 
has been covered elsewhere. But save in these specific respects it is appropriate that I exempt 
magazines from the generality of my findings.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public1.8 

It is not the purpose of this concluding section on the culture, practices and ethics of the 
press simply to summarise that which has already been set out at length. Instead, I intend to 
apply a somewhat broader perspective.

2.  possible causes
2.1 

Turning  now  to  this  wider  perspective,  a  number  of  possible  causes  of  the  problem  have 
been raised and ventilated during the course of the Inquiry, and it is appropriate to address 
these. Some have suggested that a press which rightly prides itself on its irreverence and 
fearlessness is almost destined to manifest a tendency to go too far and overreach itself. A 
press, they say, which is fearful and overly cautious would be inclined to be supine, and fail to 
discharge its primary function which is to hold power to account.

2.2 

2.3 

Others  have  suggested  that  unethical  press  practices  are  the  result  of  one  of  two  broad 
sociological factors. First, many would argue that the modern celebrity culture cannot simply 
be an artefact of a certain section of the press; it is a reflection of the fact that many people 
appear to be endlessly curious about the personal lives of sportsmen and women, film and 
pop stars, fashion models and those who attain celebrity status without having done much 
more than create or benefit from a public persona which attracts interest. Whereas the public 
as a whole were rightly horrified by the revelations at News of the World (NoTW) because 
that title’s methods so obviously crossed a red line into illegal and unethical territory, the self 
same public might well take a different view as regards lesser degrees of intrusion. Secondly, 
many have also argued that elements of the press in this country have acquired a sense of 
impunity, of being above the law, because they have become too powerful, their economic 
and social power having become concentrated into too few hands.

I have set out these possible causes without necessarily endorsing any of them. This is so for 
two reasons. First, many of these potential causes, assuming that they have been correctly 
identified, are beyond the scope of this Inquiry to the extent that it is difficult if not impossible 
to devise an antidote or a solution. If, for example, the problem lies within society as a whole, 
there could be little or nothing I could say or recommend to encourage (let alone force) the 
tectonic plates to move into an altogether different place. Secondly, and in any event, the 
Inquiry has not investigated many of these alleged causal factors to the extent necessary to 
reach clear conclusions on these complex issues, and I doubt whether it would have had the 
expertise to do so in all instances.

2.4 

That said, there are three aspects of the wider problem which merit further attention: first, 
the impact of commercial pressures in a shrinking newspaper market; secondly, the range of 
issues surrounding the modern employment context and the pressures exerted on journalists, 
and finally, issues of internal governance and leadership. These issues have been explored in 
the evidence and in submissions, and the Inquiry is in a position to examine them.

Commercial pressures

2.5  Many have pointed to the impact of commercial pressures in a dwindling marketplace. These 
pressures encourage excessive risk taking by titles that are in an incessant circulation war 
with one another; there are also pressures which operate on journalists at the metaphorical 
‘coal-face’, some of which may require them to meet unrealistic targets and deadlines, and to 
cut corners as regards the exigencies of fact checking and adherence to the letter and spirit 
of the Editors’ Code.

719

Chapter 7 | ConclusionFF

2.6 

2.7 

The Inquiry has been told by a large number of witnesses that the economic environment in 
which newspapers operate is challenging; indeed, this is a hard fact which cannot seriously 
be  disputed.  Certainly,  newspaper  publishers  in  the  UK  operate  in  a  highly  competitive 
market where margins are tight and the competition for stories is intense: these factors exert 
considerable pressure both on editors trying to fill newssheet and journalists seeking copy.

Although some newspapers are highly profitable, the overall market is in decline and has 
been for many years, this is increasingly characterised by shrinking revenue streams and low 
profitability. Market share has been steadily eroded over the last eighty years or so: first by 
radio, and then the advent and growth of television, from one channel in the early days, to 
the explosion of channels made possible by the introduction of satellite television services 
and the rollout of digital television. This loss of market share has been further exacerbated 
over the last 20 years by the growth of the internet and the close to exponential increase in 
the availability of mixed media services through that medium.

2.8  Whilst some newspapers have been able to halt the decline in sales, most newspapers have 
lost sales at a rate that threatens the future economic viability of many titles. This is a trend 
that is more acute at, but not restricted to, the local and regional level than at national level.

2.9 

The ability of newspapers to grow their own sales in the context of this overall decline is 
also constrained by the tribal loyalties of readers. Clare Enders of Enders Analysis has told 
the Inquiry that overall only 2% of the market is contestable. It is unsurprising therefore that 
the commercial need to sell stories believed to be of interest to the public is an increasingly 
potent consideration.

2.10  The impact of these pressures is not uniform. The evidence has also indicated that a difference 
in commercial imperatives exists between the broadsheets and tabloids. The journalist Nick 
Davies has suggested that the ownership and financial management of the Guardian by the 
Scott  Trust  has  enabled  the  paper  to  distance  itself  from  any  commercial  expectation  to 
maximise profit.

2.11  By contrast, Mr Davies has suggested that tabloid newspapers are likely to place a greater 
emphasis  on  circulation  numbers  than  the  broadsheets.  In  part,  this  view  has  been 
substantiated by the evidence to the Inquiry presented by both tabloid and middle market 
newspaper editors, as well as by evidence presented to the Inquiry by the former tabloid 
journalists  Richard  Peppiatt,  Mathew  Driscoll  and  Paul  McMullan.  On  the  other  hand,  Mr 
Richard Desmond, the owner of the Northern and Shell Group and publisher of the Daily 
Express and Daily Star newspapers, said in evidence that he did not believe that there was 
a direct correlation between stories and sales. Other witnesses from his titles (and indeed 
elsewhere) expressed the same view, drawing on circulation data relating to the period when 
the story of the abduction of Madeline McCann featured heavily on the front page of the 
Daily Express.

2.12  The Inquiry need not resolve this issue, but I make the following broad observation. It may 
well be that the examination of any one individual case, such as the McCann example, will fail 
to demonstrate a ‘spike’ in sales over a relatively short period of time. However, it is a different 
question,  and  one  less  verifiable  by  empirical  evidence,  as  to  whether  the  publication  of 
particular types of story over many months and years is responsible, at least in part, for long 
term trends and patterns in newspaper circulations.

720

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publicemployment issues

2.13  The  demand  for  circulation  appears  to  create,  at  least  within  some  newspaper  titles,  a 
significant  pressure  on  journalists  to  perform.  Some  of  the  journalists  who  have  given 
evidence  to  the  Inquiry  make  clear  that  the  pressures  to  secure  copy  are  extreme,  and 
that their jobs and livelihoods are at stake on an almost daily basis, particularly for those 
on temporary or informal contracts. The challenges operating in the print market are most 
obviously manifest in the reduction in journalist headcount across the national and regional 
press. The consequences for those journalists who remain are broadly uniform; they must 
produce more stories of interest to readers on reduced resource.

2.14 

In evidence to the Inquiry, a number of journalists have explained that they were required 
to produce a particular number of bylines in a given time frame. In many cases there were 
sanctions if these targets were not met; for those on short term contracts this might mean 
the termination of that contract. The former NoTW journalist, Paul McMullan has told the 
Inquiry that he kept his own cuttings in order to keep a record of the minimum of 12 bylines 
per year he was required to produce at the NoTW. The Guardian journalist David Leigh has 
suggested that, as a consequence of this pressure to generate a tangible product, at some 
newspapers there existed a real culture of fear among journalists if targets were not met.

2.15 

James Hipwell, the former city correspondent for the Daily Mirror, described similar pressure 
at that title and recalled occasions where staff would receive emails from the then editor, 
Piers Morgan, berating them for not delivering enough exclusive stories for the paper.

2.16  The challenging economic circumstances in which many newspapers operate and the continual 
pressure  on  the  bottom  line  of  most  newspaper  businesses  has  led  many  newspapers  to 
introduce  new  ways  of  working,  often  built  around  short  term  contracts,  a  growth  in 
the  use  of  freelancers  and  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  permanent  staff  posts.  Michelle 
Stanistreet, General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), has suggested that 
this increased casualisation of journalists’ employment across the newspaper industry has 
created an environment of great uncertainty for many newspaper employees. Ms Stanistreet 
claimed that journalists employed on a casual or short-term basis were forced to work under 
even greater pressures than permanent members of staff. She articulated the concerns that 
had been raised with the NUJ by freelance journalists. These included employment without 
job  security  and  a  failure  to  provide  journalists  with  the  basic  resources  they  needed  to 
undertake their work; such as the failure to provide a laptop, mobile phone and the ability 
of claiming expenses. Ms Stanistreet also said that casual and freelance journalists worked 
with permanent staff in the same pressurised newsroom environment, but invested greater 
resources  and  faced  higher  potential  losses  should  they  fail  to  deliver  stories  or  other 
achievements.

2.17  This characterisation of short term and temporary contract work presented by Ms Stanistreet 
was echoed in the evidence of Steve Turner, General Secretary of the British Association of 
Journalists. He highlighted the apparent injustice of journalists being forced to work on short-
term contracts for many years, and the fact that reporters were put under impossible pressure 
to produce stories without being given the resources to do so. This was also reflected in the 
evidence of the journalists Richard Peppiatt and Sharon Marshall.

2.18  The Inquiry has heard from journalists working at both tabloid and broadsheet titles who have 
spoken about the prevalence of bullying in some newsrooms and, in particular, the bullying 
of relatively junior and sometimes vulnerable staff by senior management teams, including 

721

Chapter 7 | ConclusionF2.19 

2.20 

editors, and the impact that such behaviour has on the working practice of journalists. In 
Part F, Chapter 4, I found that bullying had taken place at the NoTW.

It must be noted, however, that the majority of the journalists who testified before the Inquiry 
denied that there was a culture of bullying in the newspapers in which they worked. They 
freely acknowledged that the environment was competitive and pressurised, but it might be 
said that the same descriptors could be applied to many work places in different walks of life.

I am not suggesting for one moment that any witness deliberately misled the Inquiry when 
giving evidence along these lines. But had there been, for example, a culture of bullying or 
of  turning  a  blind-eye  to  ethical  standards  at  any  title,  I  doubt  whether  many  journalists 
would have been prepared to tell me that in terms. Furthermore, whether a work-place is 
‘competitive and pressured’ is to some extent a subjective impression, as is the subsidiary 
issue of whether pressure is a force for the good or the bad.

2.21  Apart from the anonymous evidence adduced through Ms Stanistreet, and the evidence from 
Steve Turner, General Secretary of the British Association of Journalists, a limited number 
of former journalists did speak to the existence of a bullying and less than ethical culture in 
the papers in which they worked. The qualitative deficiencies of the anonymous evidence 
must be recognised, and in respect of each of the former journalists there are reasons for 
treating their evidence with caution. I have examined their evidence in previous sections of 
the Report, but here I set out two pieces of evidence which struck a particular chord with me: 
this is because of the way in which the evidence was given, its inherent plausibility, and its 
consistency with other evidence.

2.22  Matthew Driscoll, formerly of NoTW, told the Inquiry in an extended sequence of answers:

F

“Q.  You  tell  us  in  your  witness  statement  at  paragraphs  7  to  that  you  spoke  to 
colleagues  about  this  blagging  technique  and  they  told  you  that  the  practice  had 
gone on for some time and also that the obtaining of medical records was common 
practice. Do you recollect that?
A.  It was certainly something that wasn’t a rarity, no.
Q.  Did you ever raise your concerns with your sports editor or with anyone else at 
the time?
A.  No. I mean – well, I certainly raised my surprise that anything like that could be 
done. That was all new to me, having come from the Daily Star. But, you know, as 
I’ve  thought  about  it  long  and  hard,  it  would  be  a  very  brave  journalist,  certainly 
in the early years of his career on the paper, to suddenly say, “I’m not happy with 
these techniques that are being used.” You’d be basically making a decision over your 
career there. Anyone on that floor who complained too much would find themselves 
pushed out, certainly.
Q.  Can you assist us with why you think this type of practice was going on? What was 
the purpose? Why did they have to resort to this?
A.  The main reason is to make sure a story’s true. You know, this is kind of the irony, 
really. Tabloid newspapers are very fearful of getting a story badly wrong, and the 
lawyers are just as – the in-house lawyers are just as scared of that because it costs 
a lot of money if you do get it wrong. Not only do you have the humiliation of putting 
an apology in the paper or it being followed up and being disproved by other papers, 
it can then cost you a lot of money in out-of-court settlements, and money is the be 
all and end all of tabloid newspapers, really, and the pressure was on to make sure 

722

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Publica story was correct and that you wouldn’t get any comeback legally. So there was a 
pressure to use, as it now turns out, almost any means necessary to make sure that 
a story was 100 per cent true.
Q.  Are there any other blagging incidents that you’d like to draw to our attention?
A.  Only ones I heard of. The examples I’ve given you are the ones I’d directly worked 
on, yeah.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I’m sorry, I just have to follow up the last answer. So everything 
that was done was done to avoid libel?
A.  That’s my opinion, yeah, certainly.
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Any consideration given to concepts of propriety or privacy
A.  I’m sure there would have been sometimes, but I think the biggest priority was to 
make sure that that story was true, to make sure there would be no litigation further 
down the road. I think that’s where the onus lied.”

2.23 

I recount this evidence without making any judgment about the managerial approach at the 
NoTW (beyond that expressed in Chapter 4 of this Part of the Report) but it is important as 
providing an insight into press culture for a number of reasons. For present purposes, the 
focus is on what Mr Driscoll had to say about an environment which effectively precluded 
whistleblowing or speaking out.

2.24 

James Hipwell, the former Daily Mirror journalist, emphasised the commercial and competitive 
pressures on journalists:3

“It was quite common to be threatened with the sack. Frankly, if a journalist doesn’t 
bring in enough exclusives or enough stories, then what use is he to a newspaper? 
This is a highly competitive industry. You can easily be replaced. It takes you years and 
years to get to – you know, to get onto a national newspaper, very often, and, you 
know, you don’t want to blow it by not pulling your weight, and the fact is if you don’t 
bring in great copy, great exclusives, you’re not going to last in the job.”

2.25 

I  appreciate  that  both  Mr  Driscoll  and  Mr  Hipwell  have  been  challenged  on  the  basis  of 
bias, the former because of his complaints directed at the NoTW and the latter following his 
treatment (and his conviction) while working at the Daily Mirror. The entirety of the evidence 
received by the Inquiry, however, points strongly to the conclusion that journalists were and 
are reluctant, if not afraid, to speak out about whatever unethical or illegal activities they 
came across, however frequently or infrequently that might have been. Equally, it is difficult 
to avoid the conclusion that the failure to provide protection to whistleblowers contributed 
to this reluctance.

2.26  Piers Morgan, former editor of the NoTW and the Daily Mirror, did not express concern that, 
to his knowledge, there were no “whistleblower” policies in place at NoTW or the Daily Mirror 
during his period as editor at these papers.4

2.27  Richard Peppiatt, a former journalist at the Daily Star, vividly described a culture in which 

whistleblowing was deterred:5

Chapter 7 | ConclusionFF

“It seemed to me that reporters’ employment contracts were structured specifically 
to limit the possibility of any ethical protest. Many, including myself, were on casual 
contracts, which is to say they can be terminated at anytime. The spectre of being 
’let go’ at any moment is a powerful deterrent against sticking your head above the 
trench if you disagree with something that is occurring. Even if someone was bold 
enough to complain, no channel existed for employees to raise concerns about ethical 
or  journalistic  practices.  My  feeling  was  certainly  that  the  further  up  the  chain  of 
command you went the less, not more, concern over newsroom behaviour existed.”

2.28  Whistleblowing is usually protected under the provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996 
to the extent that employers are not empowered to act to the detriment of employees in 
relation to public interest disclosures. However, there is a strong argument for recommending 
greater protection in this regard, and in my view the case advanced by the NUJ to the effect 
that ‘conscience clauses’ should be routinely introduced into the contracts of employment of 
journalists is more than justified.

2.29  The NUJ goes yet further, and has argued through its General Secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, 

that:6

“... there is a connection between the anti-trade union culture at News International 
and the moral vacuum that’s been allowed to proliferate.
The culture stems from the top of the organisation yet it is ordinary working journalists 
who are being sacrificed and whose livelihoods have been destroyed whilst those at 
the top of News International enjoy impunity.”

2.30  Although  I  can  see  the  clear  possibility  of  a  causal  connection  between  a  culture  where 
journalists are reluctant to speak out and the presence and in particular the perpetuation of 
unethical practices, Ms Stanistreet’s point about a similar anti-trade union culture and such 
practices is a more controversial proposition. She may be right, but I am not in a position to 
express a concluded view about this on the limited evidence I have heard.

2.31  Taken  together,  these  different  pressures  (a  competitive  market,  growth  of  new  media, 
declining circulation, reduction of journalist headcount, reduced budgets, a casualisation of 
workforce, a lack of support to whistleblowers, and a sometimes bullying culture) risk the 
prioritisation of the pursuit of a story over all other, ethical, considerations. It is of interest 
that in her evidence to the Inquiry, Ms Marshall has said that in her experience there were 
no ethical conversations in journalism. Her evidence echoed the view of Northern and Shell 
proprietor, Richard Desmond, when he told the Inquiry that: “We do not talk about ethics or 
morals because it’s a very fine line, and everybody’s ethics are different.”7 While that appeared 
to be a minority view across the industry as a whole, it nonetheless reflects the culture of a 
section of the press.

2.32 

It should be emphasised that what is here being identified is the enhancement or magnification 
of risk. Just as poor systems of governance may increase the risk of unethical practice, so 
does  the  existence  of  the  sort  of  commercial  factors  identified  here.  But  these  risks  may 
or not mature in the real world and separate consideration needs to be given to that. For 
example, an unpromising commercial environment might nonetheless engender exemplary 
newsroom practices in any given case: this would be the consequence of there being editors 
and journalists of sufficient calibre to withstand the pressures and temptations operating on

existence of an environment whose attributes might well be described as unfavourable to 
good practice will have a tendency to generate bad practice.

2.33 

Leadership and governance
I have mentioned commercial pressures on titles and personal pressures on journalists, but 
many would say that the emphasis should be more specific. To the extent that the Inquiry has 
identified a real problem within the culture, practices and ethics of the press, many would 
argue that the proximate cause of that problem should be visualised as being one of a failure 
of  leadership  and  internal  governance.  The  culture  and  tone  of  an  organisation  is  set  by 
and from the top: in terms of leading by example, insisting on adherence to standards, and 
implementing systems of governance which serve to identify and eliminate both legal and 
ethical risk at all levels of the organisation.

2.34  The Inquiry does not propose to comment in depth on the quality of leadership at NoTW 
(or higher up the corporate ladder into NI or News Corp) in any greater detail than set out 
earlier, since to do so might prejudice the criminal trials of at least two (if not many more) 
individuals. By extension, I will need to take care in examining the position in relation to other 
titles in case my reasoning and conclusions are transposed back onto NoTW or run the risk of 
offending what I have described in the Introduction as the self denying ordinance. I repeat, 
not for the first time, that this part of the Inquiry has been focused on aspects of the practices 
of the press at a higher level than the specifics ‘who did what to whom, who authorised it and 
who knew about it’; its purpose is to address issues of regulation. Within these obvious and 
ever-present constraints, it is both possible and appropriate to set out some concerns, even 
if these fall short of amounting to clear-cut and transparent conclusions.

2.35  A review of the evidence adduced before the Inquiry and already analysed has given rise to 
concern in at least two respects. First, it is suggestive of leadership and internal governance 
failures in relation to the use of private investigators and the making of cash payments: on 
any view, these were high risk areas which warranted a firmer hand on the tiller. Second there 
are concerns in relation to the use of ‘sources’.

2.36 

It has already been pointed out that a number of editors and lawyers confessed to having no 
knowledge that private investigators and search agencies were used at their titles. By way 
of example only, the editor of the Daily Star, Dawn Neesom, stated that she was not aware 
that search agencies were being used until their existence was brought to her attention by 
her legal team.8 This was also the case for Hugh Whittow, editor of the Daily Express and 
his predecessor in that role, Peter Hill. Hugh Whittow stated that he “had no knowledge of 
[the use of private investigators] at all until it started appearing in the newspapers and on 
television”9 and had only recently discovered that some reporters at the Daily Express had 
used the services of search agencies.10 More surprisingly, neither he nor Mr Hill could recall 
being made aware of the Information Commissioner’s 2006 report ‘What Price Privacy Now’,

Chapter 7 | ConclusionFeven though it identified seven journalists at the Daily Express as being involved in enlisting 
the services of private investigator Mr Whittamore.11

2.37  Elsewhere, executives, editors and lawyers who were aware of the use of private investigators 
and  search  agencies,  conceded  that  they  had  no  knowledge  of  the  methods  deployed  to 
obtain  information.  Few  expressed  concern  about  this  lack  of  knowledge,  even  with  the 
benefit of hindsight. This lack of concern was evident in the evidence of Nicole Patterson, 
head of legal at the Express and Star titles. Ms Patterson expressed the view that newspapers 
were entitled to expect search agencies and private investigators would operate within the 
law to obtain information:12

“Longmere  Consultants,  Searchline,  SystemsSearches  and  Express  Locate  are  all 
names of search agencies that I know that are used by law firms to find and serve 
people with papers, and totally legitimate as far as I was aware, and I’m not sure that 
when you employ anybody that you ask in great detail whether they – how they go 
about doing what they do. You employ a company to do something for you and you 
expect that they would do it within the law. You expect that. Not that you don’t care. 
You expect it.”

2.38  Other editors shared Ms Patterson’s expectation that search agencies would operate within 

the confines of the law.13

F

2.39  Ms Patterson also expressed the view that, as head of legal, the question of what methods 
were used were not within her remit; such considerations were editorial matters.14 However, 
as has already been noted, Ms Neesom, Mr Whittow and Mr Hill, each editors at titles owned 
by  the  Northern  &  Shell  during  Ms  Patterson’s  time  as  head  of  legal,  gave  evidence  that 
they were unaware of the use of search agencies and private investigators. At its lowest, this 
revealed a degree of confusion within management as to the allocation of responsibility for 
overseeing the use of external providers of information.

2.40 

It was also revealing that most lawyers who gave evidence to the Inquiry had backgrounds in 
corporate law or media law.15 None described having expertise in criminal law and a number 
confessed to having no knowledge of criminal law or the legality of information gathering 
techniques.16

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.41 

John Witherow, editor of The Sunday Times, was clear in his evidence that the editor bore 
responsibility  for  the  conduct  of  any  third  party  used  to  obtain  information.17  However, 
when questioned about the extent to which it was possible to police external providers of 
information, Mr Witherow conceded that it was down to individual journalists to ensure that 
private investigators “behave in what we regard as a proper way”.18 Mr Witherow was not 
alone in delegating responsibility for the supervision of private investigators to journalists. 
The former editor of the Daily Mirror, Richard Wallace, stated:19

“During my time as Editor of the Daily Mirror we have used, on occasion, the services 
of private investigators. I have not directly commissioned or had direct contact with 
them. They would, of course, have been paid for their services, but I would not be 
involved in their instructions have knowledge of what they were doing or be involved 
in the nuts and bolts of their payment.”

2.42  Against this backdrop, it is of some concern that the evidence to the Inquiry from most editors 
was that there was no procedure or protocol in place in relation to when private investigators 
or third party sources could be used, how they were identified, or the methods they were 
permitted to employ.20

2.43 

In place of protocols or procedures, emphasis was placed on the expectation that third parties 
would operate within the law.21

2.44  The Sunday Times was the only title to give evidence that they have adopted a more formal 
approach to the use of external providers of information since the phone hacking scandal. As 
Mr Witherow explained:22

“[I]n the light of the phone hacking scandal we have naturally checked to make sure 
we operate within the PCC Code and the law. As one precaution we are drawing up 
formal understandings with freelancers to make sure they abide by the law and the 
PCC Code, although most are already accredited to reputable organisations which 
require  such  behaviour.  We  have  also  introduced  a  more  formal  approach  when 
considering subterfuge. This involves the reporter making his case in writing and this

Chapter 7 | ConclusionFF

being discussed by the heads of news, the newspaper’s lawyers and the Editor and 
Managing Editor, with a formal minute made of the decision.”

2.45 

It appears that, at the majority of titles, there is no formal system in place to govern when 
journalists may engage external providers of information, and on what basis. Without the 
adoption of such a system, editors and lawyers will continue to have difficulties in controlling 
third party sources and holding accountable those responsible for unethical conduct. If the 
conditions which enabled the use of private investigators to go unchecked for so long are to be 
avoided, significant improvements must be made to systems for monitoring and supervision.

2.46  A related issue is the adequacy, or lack of it, of systems for recording payments made for 
information.  It  appears  that  until  recently  such  expenditure  was  dealt  with  as  ordinary 
expenses claims, with the result that there was little oversight at editorial level.23 A number 
of editors gave evidence that the amounts paid to external sources were small and did not 
attract attention so that there was never any cause to question the expenditure.24

2.47  Some  titles  have  acknowledged  the  need  to  improve  the  financial  accounting  system 
and  have  introduced  new  systems  to  monitor  expenditure.  For  example,  at  NI  there  was 
acknowledgement that the payments control system was inadequate and it was replaced in 
September 2011.25 Before then it was left up to the discretion of the managing editor whether 
or not to question individual payments. Under the new system the policy makes clear that 
journalists  should  use  non  cash  methods  of  payment  for  information,  and  only  when  the 
source insists on a cash payment is it acceptable to pay in cash. The journalist requesting 
the cash must obtain agreement from his or her departmental head that payment be made, 
and that authorisation must be countersigned by the editor or a deputy editor, as well as the 
managing editor. It is notable, however, that the new system does not necessarily require the 
identification of the recipient of cash payments and there is no limit to cash payments.26

2.48  Other  titles  have  failed  to  acknowledge  the  difficulties  presented  by  informal  accounting 
systems. Mr Desmond gave evidence that “the company operates stringent costs management, 
which I believe helps us to ensure that the company’s money is not used for any unlawful 
purpose”.27 But tight purse strings are not a surrogate for proper accounting systems, and 
Paul Ashford, Northern & Shell group editorial director, conceded that there are flaws in the 
company’s financial accounting system.28

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.49  A related leadership or governance issue concerns the use of sources. It is of course appreciated 
that a balance has to be struck between on the one hand micro-managing each and every 
story to the extent that sources are identified and checked for accuracy and reliability, and 
on the other hand trusting the journalist’s say-so that source X is reliable. The former would 
be unworkable in practice, not least given the pressure of deadlines and the fact that many 
stories by their nature do not need this degree of close attention. The latter is unacceptably 
laissez-faire. Overall, there is considerable room for improvement in this regard, and more 
should be done at management level, by editors and lawyers in particular, to interrogate and 
verify the sources of information prior to authorising publication of a story.

2.50  Most of the editors who gave evidence to the Inquiry acknowledged that responsibility for 
deciding whether to publish a story rests with them. However, most also stated that they 
would frequently authorise publication of a story without knowing the identity of a source.29

2.51  Editors expressed the common view that primary responsibility for checking sources lies with 
the  journalist.  This  in  itself  is  an  appropriate  delegation  of  responsibility.  However,  it  has 
become clear that there are inadequate systems in place to verify sources. The gravamen 
of the evidence received by the Inquiry was along the lines that only if something about the 
story caught an editor’s attention would the reliability of sources be questioned.30 A number 
of journalists stated that they were rarely asked to verify the facts of a story.31 The approach 
was  justified,  in  part,  by  the  need  to  protect  source  anonymity.32  More  generally,  editors 
emphasised the importance of trust in the reliability and integrity of individual journalists as 
being fundamental to the operation of the newsroom.33 Mr Wallace’s view epitomised that 
expressed by most editors:34

“To the best of my knowledge and belief, my journalists (like me) do comply with the 
law and the Code and I must trust them to do so. In the absence of any reason to call 
this relationship of trust into question, I do not believe that I should necessarily (or in 
some cases, properly) be aware of my journalists’ sources and methods.”

Chapter 7 | ConclusionF2.52  Although a degree of trust in subordinates is required in the operation of any organisation, 
there  is  concern  as  to  the  extent  of  unchecked  discretion  afforded  to  journalists  across 
the  newspaper  industry,  and  it  is  certainly  arguable  that  this  sort  of  laissez-faire  attitude 
engendered a climate in which more serious ethical and legal breaches could be permitted 
to occur. Furthermore, this lack of supervision and excessive degree of trust may well have 
fostered a culture in which journalists feel able to publish stories on the basis of a single, 
unverified source.

2.53  The complacency evidenced in the presumption that individual journalists would act lawfully 
and ethically is all the more concerning when viewed in the context of the failure within the 
press to develop effective systems to govern standards of conduct. In an industry which relies 
so heavily on the delegation of responsibility to journalists, it is essential that stringent codes 
of  conduct  and  systems  of  accountability  are  developed  and  implemented.  However,  the 
available evidence suggests that there was a failure across significant sections of the industry 
to develop and implement appropriate systems to govern conduct and ethics. The Editors’ 
Code of Practice provided a reasonable benchmark for adequate practice, but the evidence 
examined  in  Chapter  6  above  suggests  that  not  enough  was  done  to  ensure  compliance, 
and that such systems as were in place were and are informal in nature and defined by the 
personalities of the individuals in positions of leadership.

2.54  Mr Peppiatt provided the following account of the treatment of the PCC Code during his time 

as a journalist at the Daily Star:35

F

“I  would  describe  corporate  governance  at  the  Daily  Star  as  laissez-faire  at  best. 
There  was  little  or  nothing  in  the  way  of  documents  or  official  policies  governing 
conduct. I was never asked or offered the opportunity to sign a code of conduct, nor 
did there exist to my knowledge an ’employee handbook’ type resource to reference. 
The  PCC  Code  was  not  something  that  I  ever  heard  referenced  in  relation  to  how 
a  story  should  be  handled,  although  certain  limitations  such  as  not  trespassing  in 
hospitals were implicitly acknowledged. I have admitted that some stories I wrote at 
the Daily Star were wholly inaccurate, often written under pressure from superiors to 
distort the facts at hand. For me to have referenced the PCC Code to protest against 
this I would have been laughed out the door.”

2.55  Asked to describe how the Editors’ Code of Practice was enforced at the Daily Star, Ms Neesom 

gave the following evidence:36

“It’s just expected of the staff and it’s enforced by people not being very happy with 
them if they mess up … The journalist concerned will probably be warned by the news 
desk that they have done something wrong … I personally probably wouldn’t talk to 
the journalist concerned, but the news desk or my deputy editor would.”

2.56  Systems of supervision at other titles were similarly informal. Colin Myler, former editor of the 
NoTW, in somewhat vague terms described relying on “a culture of individual and collective 
responsibility for ensuring compliance with the PCC Code and the law” during his editorship.37

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicMr Wallace explained that one of the checks on conduct at the Daily Mirror is to position 
senior reporters alongside more junior reporters.38

2.57  Dominic Mohan, editor of The Sun emphasised how he sought “to foster a culture of honesty, 
integrity and high ethical standards at the Sun”39. However, when asked how he had tried to 
foster those qualities, his answer revealed that ethical controls at The Sun are similarly ad 
hoc, relying on the judgment of individual journalists and the initiatives and attentions of 
individual managers rather than being systematic:40

“I think just on – an editor can – their contact on a day-to-day basis with their staff, so 
whether that be in morning news conference, during my features conferences, during 
my lunchtime plot meetings or my presence on the back bench in the newsroom on a 
daily basis, I think people know what I expect of them and know what standards and 
ethics that I stand by.”

2.58 

In the absence of formal systems of enforcement, even instances of clear and serious breaches 
of the Codes did not result in significant disciplinary action. The Inquiry has already examined 
in depth the response of senior management at the NoTW to Mr Justice Eady’s strictures in 
relation to the thinly-veiled threats to two of the women involved in the Max Mosley privacy 
claim, and has touched on that of senior management at Trinity Mirror in relation to the 
Starsuckers investigation. These are indicative of a cultural tendency metaphorically to circle 
the wagons, defend that which has been criticised (even judicially) and attacking those who 
utter the criticism and, in some cases, garnering support from others in the industry. Free 
speech is, of course, of critical importance; judges (among others) are not infallible and are 
well used to being criticised without having the ability to respond. Similar criticism can be 
advanced about appellate decisions. What is missing, however, is internal reflection about 
(and action in respect of) breaches of the Code which are worthy of censure.

2.59  Putting to one side that fact that an editor is ultimately responsible for what is published, 
questions naturally arise as to whether the real problem within the culture, practices and 
ethics  of  the  press  which  this  Inquiry  has  identified  should  be  regarded  as  a  failure  of 
leadership. For reasons which have already been fully explained, it is unnecessary to venture 
into the territory of whether an editor at any particular title must have been aware of specific 
malpractice merely by virtue of his or her position. I have in fact already made clear that a 
number of editors were unaware, for example, of the extensive use of private investigators 
within their organisations, and if this evidence is to be accepted (and there is nothing directly 
to contradict it) it does tend to suggest that the editorial role does not automatically carry 
with it knowledge and understanding of every journalistic practice which is in play in the title 
for which the editor is responsible.

2.60  Approaching the issue at a far higher level of generality, however, it is possible to express 
a number of tentative views. The point has already been made that the culture or tone of 
an organisation is set by or at the top. If ethical failings have been highlighted, it would be 
counter-intuitive to regard these as largely attributable to the isolated frailties of individual 
‘rogue’ journalists. As in other walks of life (evident, for example, in relation to the police),

Chapter 7 | ConclusionFjournalists take their lead from the example set by the leaders and managers within their 
organisations, and are guided and influenced by the culture within the industry as a whole. 
Although it would be equally counter-intuitive to regard journalists as purely the ‘victims’ of 
such a culture, or of an ethical vacuum created by inaction at the highest levels within the 
organisation, the significance of this factor does need to be acknowledged.

2.61 

Insight into issues of this sort was provided by Richard Desmond’s candid evidence to the 
Inquiry, betraying a reluctance on his part to engage with what might be thought to be a basic 
questions that all those in journalism should be prepared to focus on. He said: “Ethical – I 
don’t know what the word means, perhaps you would explain what the word means,” before 
adding, as noted above: “We do not talk about ethics or morals because it’s a very fine line 
and everybody is different”.41

2.62  Even when those in a leadership role acknowledged errors of judgment, they were unwilling 
to confront the ethical component of that failure. Many editors expressed regret at the way in 
which the Christopher Jefferies story was reported; yet none sought to explore what ethical 
standards had been transgressed in this episode. For example, Mr Wallace viewed the failings 
which led to the publication of the Jefferies story as a “black mark” on his career, stating 
that “I think Mr Jefferies’ name will be imprinted on my brain forever more. It will change 
very much the way I deal with any story of this nature in the future”.42 However, he did not 
consider that any practical changes could be made to reduce the risk of recurrence, stating:43

F

“Ultimately it’s down to the judgments of editors and, you know, as I found in this 
regard  and  other  mistakes  have  been  highlighted,  we  all  make  mistakes.  I’m  not 
seeking to downplay those mistakes or dismiss them; I’m just saying you can have as 
many safeguards and checks and balances in place you would like but these errors 
are going to happen. It’s about creating a climate, I believe, which makes all editors 
think perhaps a little bit longer than they have previously.”

2.63 

In the absence of clear leadership on ethical standards, it is at least arguable that journalists 
latched on to alternative barometers of what amounted to acceptable conduct.

2.64  Another  trend  emerging  from  the  evidence  considered  above  is  that  the  press  tend  to 
subsume  ethical  considerations  within  an  assessment  of  legal  risk.  This  type  of  reasoning 
process  was  encapsulated  in  the  explanation  provided  by  Mr  Desmond  which  follows  his 
answer about ethics and identifies the approach taken at his titles:44

“I think that we are in a business to give readers/viewers what they want to read and 
watch and as long as it is legal that is what we aim to do. We do not talk about ethics 
or morals because it is a very fine line and everybody’s ethics are different. However, 
we do of course care about the title’s reputation and so we would not run a story if 
we thought it would damage that or seriously affect someone’s life.”

732

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public2.65  One of the consequences of this approach was that legality, or in some cases, the risk of being 
sued, became the touchstone of acceptable conduct. A number of editors and executives 
gave evidence that they would be more likely to engage in conduct which might amount to a 
civil wrong if they knew that the subject of a story or photograph was not likely to bring a civil 
action. This was to some extent evident in the evidence provided by Mail on Sunday editor, 
Peter Wright, who said:45

“Sometimes [duty lawyers] are overcautious, and in particularly on celebrity stories, 
you  have  to  take  a  view  to  –  we’re  talking  about  libel  here  –  there  are  certain 
individuals who are very likely to sue and other individuals who, for whatever reason, 
are very unlikely to sue, and because I’ve been doing this job for a very long time, I 
may have a better knowledge of that than the duty lawyer. The duty lawyer will point 
out to me, “Look, this could be – there could be a risk here”, and it’s their job to point 
out the risk. It’s my job to take the decision.”

2.66  The prioritisation of the management of legal liability over ethical risk was present in the 
legal departments of some newspapers. Senior lawyers who gave evidence to the Inquiry 
narrowly defined the scope of their responsibilities to exclude any comment on ethical risk 
as opposed to legal risk and liability. This was particularly evident in the legal department at 
NI. Lawyers would not advise about the legality of methods used to obtain information,46 nor 
would they advise on the PCC Code which was an editorial matter.47 Their remit focused on all 
aspects of libel law and the legal risks attendant on defamation; dealing with post publication 
complaints; and copyright complaints.48 The position was the same at Express Newspapers.49

2.67  The  consequences  of  the  focus  on  legality  over  ethics  were  eloquently  captured  in  the 
evidence  of  Mr  Peppiatt.  He  commented  on  the  distinction  between  a  legal  and  a  moral 
sense of truth:50

“The legal sense of truth is sort of: what can we get away with saying? That’s sort 
of  the  legal  sense.  The  moral  sense  would  be  more: what  would  be  a  fair  way  to 
represent  this?  What  would  be  an  accurate  way  to  represent  this?  Now,  tabloid 
newspapers have no interest in the moral sense. All they want to do is think: what 
can we get away with saying? How far with we push the boundaries and get away 
with it? As you see when you have these monsterings of people, it’s sort of: how far 
with we push it? If one newspaper pushes the line, everyone rushes to fill the void 
behind them. It’s just a matter of: what can we get away with saying? There’s no 
consideration of: what are the ethics? What are the moral considerations?”

Chapter 7 | ConclusionF2.68 

It appears that sometimes the fact that conduct was legally permissible became an excuse 
not to probe whether conduct was also morally acceptable. This is particularly so in relation 
to libel (can we prove it is true?) as distinct from privacy (does it transgress Article 8 rights?) 
although the latter is increasing in prominence as the law has had to deal with an increasing 
number of complaints in this area.

2.69  Another damaging tendency was, and is, for editors to measure the rectitude of their reporting 
against the conduct of their competitors. A number of editors and journalists, when asked to 
justify some of the more egregious examples of misconduct discussed in this Report, relied 
heavily on the fact that other titles were printing the stories.

2.70  For example, Mr Desmond would not accept that Mr Hill behaved unethically in relation to his 
stewardship of the coverage of the McCann story. When asked whether he agreed that it was 
up to the editor not to behave in such a way, he replied “No, not at all. Every paper – I didn’t 
bring every paper with me, but I’m sure we can justify my statement – every paper every day 
for that period of time was talking about the McCanns. It was the hot story – it was the story.”51

2.71  Mr Hill was likewise unrepentant about the coverage of the McCann case. He justified it as 

follows:52

F

“My decision was made because I believed that the stories were true and that the 
readers of The Daily Express had an interest in them. The Daily Express was not the 
only medium that published offending stories. They appeared widely in the press and 
on every TV station. I have never made up a story or asked anyone else so to do. Of 
course, if there is a big story, there is also pressure to get the best lines because it is a 
highly competitive industry. However, that does not mean that journalists will invent 
stories and that newspapers will print made up stories.”

2.72 

It is notable that his justification again relied heavily on the fact that other titles were printing 
the stories, as if that in itself provided a basis for vindicating the accuracy of the story. Editor-
in-Chief of Associated Newspapers, Paul Dacre, whilst accepting that errors had been made 
in the reporting of Mr Jefferies’ case, emphasised that coverage by the Daily Mail was less 
offensive  than  at  many  other  titles.53  In  this  respect,  he  agreed  with  the  suggestion  that 
there is a snowball effect that impacts on the way in which other newspapers report the same 
story, observing: “I think the way the boundaries are pushed by the press collectively almost 
encourages some papers, not all papers, to push the limits too far”.54

2.73  An element of relativism was again evident in Mr Dacre’s appraisal of Daily Mail’s coverage 

of the McCann story:

“I think looking back there was obviously the odd article that we regretted. I think – 
but I think, on a balanced view of the Daily Mail’s performance on that story over the 
years, I think we were at the more responsible end.” 55

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the PublicMr Dacre described the pressure within the newsroom to carry the same stories as other 
papers.

“[T]his  was  the  most  extraordinary  story.  There  have  only  been  two  or  three  in 
my  lifetime.  You  could  actually  see,  when  you  got  the  circulation  reports  of  other 
newspapers  that  week,  people  putting  the  McCanns  on  the  front  pages,  their 
circulations went up. I remember the rows and recrimination in our offices that we 
weren’t  carrying  these  stories.  Well,  in  retrospect,  I’m  glad  we  didn’t  carry  those 
stories.”56

2.74  The Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, characterised the combined effect of some of these factors 
as amounting to or creating a ‘race to the bottom in standards’.57 No doubt he was deploying 
all  his  rhetorical  skills  to  make  his  point,  but  putting  the  same  point  another  way  and 
certainly  somewhat  less  aggressively,  it  must  be  accepted  that  there  is  not  a  race  to  the 
top.  The  combined  effect  of  the  predominance  of  commercial  considerations,  the  lack  of 
clear ethical direction from the top, the subordination of ethical considerations to legal risk, 
and the element of moral relativism involved in seeking to justify one’s own conduct with 
reference to what others were doing at the same time, gives rise to the strong suspicion that 
ethical practice was not always given the central position it deserved within the culture of a 
significant section of the press.

2.75  Aside from the issue of leadership, that of internal governance also falls to be addressed. 
The point has already been made that governance within newspapers has a tendency to be 
informal and personality based. Given the nature of this type of business, much will always 
depend on the personal qualities of those at the top of the organisation, and it is understood 
that proprietors in search of profit in a declining market will naturally enough be tending 
to focus on the commercial and charismatic qualities of their editors, in particular on their 
ability  to  enhance  the  saleability  of  their  product.  That  said,  it  is  clear  from  some  of  the 
evidence received by the Inquiry from those in senior editorial and management positions 
that a high value is placed on the maintenance of ethical standards in certain sections of the 
press, and on that basis there is no reason why this level of practice should not be capable of 
being replicated across the board.

2.76  Proper  internal  governance  also  involves  the  creation  and  implementation  of  systems  of 
standards, training, supervision, audit and review. In most titles the evidence pointed to the 
existence of systems which may fairly be described as informal and cursory. Many editors 
have  informed  the  Inquiry  that  in  a  fast-moving  news  and  current  affairs  environment  it 
would be quite unrealistic to expect anything more formal, still less the imposition of systems 
which would entail undue bureaucracy and sclerotic decision making. I am not proposing this 
sort of regime because I too understand the practical realities as well as the obvious risk that 
going too far would be counter-productive. Nonetheless, it is clear to me that more could 
and should be done to ensure that potentially problematic cases are addressed in a more 
structured manner with key decisions recorded, with short reasons given, in order both to 
improve the decision making process and enhance accountability.

2.77 

I have already made the point that much of the content of newspapers is uncontroversial in 
the sense that it does not create significant legal and ethical risks. I also fully understand and

Chapter 7 | ConclusionFF

appreciate that the majority of celebrity reporting is based on information provided directly 
by the individuals themselves, or by their agents. However, experienced editors, sub-editors 
and lawyers must develop an accurate sense of which stories are likely to test the boundaries 
of legal and ethical reporting, and, in any event, systems should be in place to assess risk in 
these respects. For example, the ‘big’ stories which attracted a significant proportion of the 
time and attention of this Inquiry quite obviously fell in that category even before they ever 
saw the light of day; and the same applies, albeit to a lesser extent, to many of the smaller 
stories which the Inquiry has examined.

2.78  Equally, and in this regard it is appropriate to speak very generally, stories which appear to 
have been obtained by surreptitious means are likely to attract greater risk. I believe that had 
more time been taken in these instances for discussion about both the legal and ethical risks, 
and the quality and reliability of the sources, with that discussion noted contemporaneously 
for review and audit after the event, it is probable that far fewer of these objectionable stories 
would ever have been published. Furthermore, the implementation of systems which require 
a greater element of formality and accountability is likely to lead in the longer-term to the 
fostering of a culture which is both more risk averse and more respectful of the legitimate 
private rights of individuals.

2.79  Finally, I would also like to add a word on journalism training. I have not sought to look at 
the  adequacy  of  the  training  available  to,  or  provided  to,  journalists.  However,  a  number 
of professors of journalism have given evidence to the Inquiry and it is apparent from their 
evidence that the schools of journalism are committed to offering high quality training in 
which ethical journalism plays a full part. Largely as a result of the financial pressures on 
parts of the press, journalism training is increasingly moving away from newsrooms and into 
the universities. There is also an important role for ongoing in house training, including in 
relation to new laws and ethical or compliance issues that are highlighted by particular cases. 
A number of titles have told the Inquiry that they work with the PCC to deliver training on 
specific issues as appropriate. It is clearly important that the industry generally, and employers 
in particular, should place a high priority on training to ensure, inter alia, that all journalists 
understand the legal and ethical context within which they work.

3.  the relevance of the internet
3.1  Many editors and commentators have argued that the burgeoning of the internet is likely to 
render irrelevant much of the work of the Inquiry even assuming that it has not already done 
so. If, for example, celebrity X’s privacy is violated online, then the metaphorical cat is well 
out of the bag, and there is no reason why open season should not exist in the printed media. 
A clear exemplification of that argument is the justification used by The Sun in relation to the 
Prince Harry photographs, discussed in Chapter 5.

3.2 

In my view, this argument is flawed for two reasons. Putting to one side publications such as 
the Mail Online which bind themselves voluntarily to the Editors’ Code of Practice (and which 
is legitimately proud of the world-wide on line readership that it has built up), the internet 
does not claim to operate by any particular ethical standards, still less high ones. Some have 
called it a ‘wild west’ but I would prefer to use the term ‘ethical vacuum’. This is not to say 
for one moment that everything on the internet is therefore unethical. That would be a gross 
mischaracterisation of the work of very many bloggers and websites which should rightly and 
fairly be characterised as valuable and professional. The point I am making is a more modest 
one, namely that the internet does not claim to operate by express ethical standards, so that 
bloggers and others may, if they choose, act with impunity.

PART F | The Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public3.3 

3.4 

3.5 

The press, on the other hand, does claim to operate by and adhere to an ethical code of 
conduct. Publishers of newspapers will be (or, at least, are far more likely to be) far more 
heavily resourced than most, if not all, bloggers and websites that report news (as opposed 
to search engines that direct those on line to different sites). Newspapers, through whichever 
medium  they  are  delivered,  purport  to  offer  a  quality  product  in  all  senses  of  that  term. 
Although in the light of the events leading to the setting up of this Inquiry and the evidence 
I  have  heard,  the  public  is  entitled  to  be  sceptical  about  the  true  quality  of  parts  of  that 
product in certain sections of the press, the premise on which newspapers operate remains 
constant: that the Code will be adhered to, that within the bounds of natural human error 
printed facts whether in newsprint or online will be accurate, and that individual rights will 
be respected. In contrast, the internet does not function on this basis at all. People will not 
assume that what they read on the internet is trustworthy or that it carries any particular 
assurance  or  accuracy;  it  need  be  no  more  than  one  person’s  view.  There  is  none  of  the 
notional  imprimatur  or  kitemark  which  comes  from  being  the  publisher  of  a  respected 
broadsheet or, in its different style, an equally respected mass circulation tabloid.

The  second  reason  largely  flows  from  the  first.  There  is  a  qualitative  difference  between 
photographs being available online and being displayed, or blazoned, on the front page of a 
newspaper such as The Sun. The fact of publication in a mass circulation newspaper multiplies 
and magnifies the intrusion, not simply because more people will be viewing the images, but 
also because more people will be talking about them. Thus, the fact of publication inflates the 
apparent newsworthiness of the photographs by placing them more firmly within the public 
domain and at the top of the news agenda. As Professor Baroness Onora O’Neill made clear58, 
it is important:

“to recognise the extent to which exposure to media content is unchosen – particularly 
by  children,  those  in  institutional  settings,  and  those  in  public  places.  Regulation 
should have regard to the realities of media penetration rather than assuming that it 
always reflects consumer choices.”

Ultimately,  this  is  most  decidedly  not  a  debate  about  free  speech.  A  newspaper’s  right 
to  publish  what  it  chooses  within  the  general  law  (whether  or  not  it  complies  with  the 
Editors’ Code) is not in question, although within a more robust regulatory framework the 
consequences of a breach of the Code, publication having occurred, might well be such as to 
have a deterrent effect. To turn this into a debate about free speech both misses the point 
and is in danger of creating the sort of moral relativism which has already been remarked on. 
This is, or at least should be, a debate about freedom with responsibility, and about an ethical 
press not doing something which it is technically quite able to do but decides not to do. This 
freedom (and where the editors choose to draw the line whether rightly or otherwise) was 
neatly encapsulated by the decisions taken in relation to Prince Harry and the Duchess of 
Cambridge.

4.  the press response to this inquiry
4.1 

Our free press has been and is entitled to comment as it chooses on the work of this Inquiry, 
and although I am equally entitled to exercise my own right of free speech, I am firmly of the 
view that it is not for me to reflect any commentary back onto the press. However, it is right 
that I make an observation on one matter.

Chapter 7 | ConclusionF4.2 

The publicist, Max Clifford was asked to comment on the effect, if any, that the Inquiry and 
the general public mood were having on the current work of the press. He said this:59

“Q.  Do you have any feel for what’s going on at the moment? Has the scandal which 
broke last summer had a chilling effect on the types of methods which are being used 
now to obtain stories?
A.  I mean hopefully yes, I mean, it’s frightened people and made them stop those 
kind of things, which is what I believe and sincerely hope, but also the effect of this 
Inquiry, I think, has frightened editors, so, you know, for example, in recent months 
there’s  several  major  stories  which  would  have  dominated  the  headlines  that  I’m 
aware of which haven’t come out.
Q.  I don’t want you on that topic to say anything which would invade any individual’s 
privacy, but can you give us some idea of what exactly it is which is holding editors 
back from publishing the sort of story you have just mentioned?
A.  Well,  I  think  it’s  a  backlash.  It’s  a  public  backlash.  I mean, what  really  got  the 
British public angry was Milly Dowler and the McCanns, wasn’t it? People like that. 
You know, stars having their phones tapped, people like myself that are successful, 
wealthy,  have  done  very,  very  well  out  of  the  media  or  films,  television,  so  what, 
those people don’t care, they have far more important things to worry about. But 
when they read and heard about Milly Dowler, when they read and press. It’s the 
best chance anybody’s got, otherwise we’re like Chinese and Russians and just slaves 
to the system. But are they savage? Can they be savage? Absolutely right. Of course 
some  of  the  most  successful  papers  are  the  most  savage  because  an  awful  lot  of 
people would much rather read nasty things about other people than nice things.”

I  have  no  hesitation  in  accepting  the  way  in  which  Mr  Clifford  characterises  the  present 
position.  He  gave  his  evidence  in  a  forthright  manner  and  had  no  reason  or  motive  to 
mislead the Inquiry. I do not interpret his evidence as suggesting that press conduct has been 
exemplary since July 2011, and that in any event would not accord with my own experience: 
indeed, three of the case studies as discussed earlier,60 post date the commencement of this 
Inquiry, and, whatever view might be taken of these stories, indicate that the chilling effect of 
the Inquiry (if it exists at all) is limited.

If, as appears likely, the press, or certain sections of the press, have exercised a substantial 
measure of self-restraint for the reasons explained by Mr Clifford or otherwise, I do have to 
ask myself what will happen after this Report has been published and memories begin to 
fade. I have little hesitation in concluding that, unless something is done about it, the press 
would fairly speedily revert to type: in other words, it would start printing the sort of stories 
to which Max Clifford has alluded. It is not difficult to come to such a conclusion given the 
history of self-regulation of the press, and the lessons to be derived from that. Part D Chapter 
1 of the Report recalled the cyclical nature of press self-regulation. In the aftermath of the 
three Royal Commissions, the Younger Report, Sir David Calcutt QC’s two reports, and the 
death of Princess Diana, the press has shown signs of reform and signs of self-improvement 
only to regress in the years that follow, prompting the need for a further Royal Commission, 
public inquiry or similar. The fact is that many of the root causes of the problems in the culture 
practices and ethics of the press (in particular, commercial pressures in a declining market-

place) endure, and, to be blunt, a fairly basic understanding of human nature suggests that 
the problems identified are unlikely to be eliminated by self-control.

This is not to be interpreted as an altogether pessimistic message. There are many who argue 
that it would be a mistake to swim against the tide of human nature. That viewpoint may 
or may not be correct in other contexts, but in my view it does not apply in the present. A 
laissez faire approach would carry with it a pessimistic message, but that is both negative and 
unrealistic. The real problem which I believe exists within the culture, practices and ethics 
of the press justifies, if not demands, a more robust system of independent press regulation 
which is capable of addressing that problem head on.

Not merely would such a system have the obvious benefit of meeting the immediate needs of 
those who have suffered at the hands of the press, it would also bring about, incrementally 
and over the course of time, lasting change within the culture, practices and ethics of the 
press  to  a  point  when  it  would  no  longer  be  appropriate  to  speak  of  practices  which  are 
cultural. Instead, we would have arrived at a state of affairs in which any failings or lapses 
would indeed be isolated and straightforward examples of frank human error or, as one press 
core participant has put it, ‘unadorned errors of judgment’ which would not be evidence of a 
sub standard culture or practices.

Putting to one side the current investigations, the clearest message which comes out of the 
entirety of this lengthy part of the Report addressing the culture, practices and ethics of the 
press overall is that, time and time again, there have been serious and uncorrected failures 
within parts of the national press that may have stretched from the criminal to the indefensibly 
unethical, from passing off fiction as fact to paying lip service to accuracy. In doing so, far 
from holding power to account, in these regards the press is exercising unaccountable power 
which nobody holds to account. In my view, the maintenance of the status quo is simply not 
an option; the need for change in internal but most importantly in external regulation has 
been powerfully identified.

There is a corollary point which I also wish to emphasise. Lord Black told the Inquiry that in 
his view the phone hacking scandal by itself was ‘[i]n terms of the architecture of the system...
the most obvious example of why urgent reform of the system is needed’.61 Lord Black did not 
provide any further examples justifying the need for urgent reform, but the lengthy pages 
of this Part of the Report most certainly do. It has not been my purpose or endeavour to 
apportion blame but it has been necessary to set out the substantial, if not overwhelming, 
weight of evidence which not merely justifies but requires regulatory form in a manner which 
meets public expectations and the public interest. In my view the case for such reform has 
been proven many times over.

Having made this fundamental point strongly as I am able, I return to what I said at the very 
start of Part F of the Report. I recognise the constitutional important of free speech within the 
context of a responsible press, and I also recognise that most of what the press does is good 
journalism free from the sort of vices I have had to address at length. No one reading this 
Report in full should come away with the impression that the press as an industry is shot to 
pieces. It is not; but at the same time as acknowledging that, I also state and repeat that what 
has come out of the investigation that this Chapter of the Report summarises demonstrates 
that it is essential that the need for a fresh start in press regulation is fully embraced, and a 
new regime thereafter implemented.

Introduction
The  issues  addressed  in  this  Part  of  the  Report,  driven  largely  by  understandable  public 
concern, were expressed succinctly by Robert Jay QC in opening Module Two of the Inquiry:1 

1.2 

1.3 

1.4 

“Public concern hereabouts may be expressed in just one sentence: the relationship 
between the police and the media, and News International in particular, was, at best, 
inappropriately close and if not actually corrupt, very close to it. Furthermore, the 
nature of this relationship may explain why the police did not properly investigate 
phone hacking in 2006 and subsequently in 2009 and 2010, preferring to finesse the 
issue on these later occasions by less than frank public statements.”

In  seeking  to  address  these  key  questions,  the  Inquiry’s  Terms  of  Reference  require  an 
examination of the relationship between the press and the police, a review of the extent to 
which the current policy, practices and regulatory framework has failed, and a consideration 
of any recommendations as to the future conduct of relations between the police and the 
press.

Although this requires the Inquiry to consider the conduct of the police, that scrutiny only 
applies to the extent that that conduct meshes with the relationship between the police and 
the press, rather than more generally. The primary focus of the gathering of evidence has 
been directed towards possible recommendations for the future; inevitably, that has involved 
a reflective and analytical investigation of the past which identifies areas of practice which 
can be subject to critical appraisal. 

During Module Two, the Inquiry heard oral evidence from 93 witnesses. 36 of these were 
serving or former police officers, including the current Commissioner of the Metropolitan 
Police Service (MPS) and 11 Chief Constables. Evidence was also taken from 25 journalists. 
Much of the evidence has testified and paid tribute to the high standards maintained and 
hard work carried out by the Police Service, often in very challenging circumstances. There 
has been real support for the positive aspects of the relationship between the police and 
the press and the way in which they can work together (for example in relation to appeals 
for witnesses). However, the Inquiry has also heard evidence which leads me to conclude 
that the relationship is in need of recalibration. Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Commissioner of 
the MPS, conceded on arriving to the role in September 2011 that “…it is right to observe 
that those relations [that is to say, the relationship between the MPS and the media] were in 
neither a normal nor an entirely healthy state…”.2 Furthermore, the Commissioner went on:3

“I  recognise  that  there  is  a  need  to  review  and  improve  our  relationship  with  the 
media.  It  seems  clear  from  recent  events  relating  to  phone  hacking…that  the

Gboundaries  between  the  MPS  and  the  media  need  to  be  reconsidered  and  reset. 
However, I would not wish to return to a police service which is perceived as secretive 
and unaccountable by the public and considered unprofessional by the media.”

1.5 

The stark suggestion that the original police phone hacking investigation in 2006, Operation 
Caryatid, was curtailed because of pressure from News International is covered in detail in 
Part E, Chapter 4 of this Report. In reaching conclusions and considering recommendations for 
the future in this part of the Inquiry, I have considered and examined the different potential 
manifestations of the arguably over-cosy relationship between the police and the press, both 
through the detailed example of Operation Caryatid and the experiences of the day-to-day 
relationships that we have heard about from both the press and the police; it is only through 
this process that the exact nature of the underlying problem might be ascertained. Mr Jay 
provided a summary of these manifestations, in no particular order, in his opening submission 
to Module Two:4

“First, the acceptance and conferring of inappropriate hospitality. The risks here are 
self-evident.
Secondly, the giving and receiving of ‘off the record’ briefings. Again, the risks here 
are pretty much self-explanatory, but apart from the obvious lack of transparency the 
person doing the briefing will often have an agenda and each party will be hoping for, 
if not expecting, future favours.
Thirdly, the kindred problem of ‘leaks’, putting to one side genuine whistle-blowing.
Fourthly,  the  equally  associated  problem  of  the  attribution  by  the  Press  of  ‘police 
sources’ to stories. This is a term which is redolent of impropriety, or at the very least 
carries with it the possibility of inappropriate behaviour, either because the police 
officer has indulged in gossip or leaks, or because the term is in truth a cipher or fig-
leaf for an invented story because the source does not in fact exist. It should also be 
recognised…that the so-called ‘police source’ may not be a police officer but someone 
associated with the Police but from outside the MPS.
Fifthly, the Press turning up at incidents, or at newsworthy occasions, because they 
have  been  tipped  off  by  a  Police  officer.  Again,  this  is  indicative  of  an  unhealthy 
relationship existing between individual police officers and individual members of the 
press…” 

1.6 

These five potential features or manifestations of what may be an underlying problem in the 
relationship between the police and the press are not intended to be an exhaustive list of the 
issues that are considered in this part of the Report. It is also important to emphasise that 
some of these issues have also been dealt with or touched on in the recent reports of Sir Denis 
O’Connor (then HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary)5 and Mrs Elizabeth Filkin (reviewing the 
position at the MPS).6 I have been much assisted by their work, which is covered in more 
detail in Chapter Three below.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.	 The	purpose	of	the	relationship	and	public	confidence
The relationship between the press and the police, and between the press and the public, is 
2.1 
a keystone in the foundation of a democracy and an effective criminal justice system.

2.2 

The approach to policing in this country can be explained as ‘policing by consent’. Commissioner 
Hogan-Howe described this concept as meaning policing with, and on behalf of, the public. It 
is axiomatic therefore that public confidence in the police is a key element in sustaining this 
model. Commissioner Hogan-Howe stressed in his evidence to the Inquiry that the public 
have been, and must continue to be, partners in preventing and solving crime, and that this 
is most effectively achieved through the conduit of the media which enables witnesses to 
come forward and provide evidence. It can also be said that an effective and professional 
relationship with the media can often prevent an operation being jeopardised. Agreements 
can be reached between the media and police officers that the former will not run a particular 
story until such time as it is operationally safe to do so; it is argued, with real force, that this is 
a vital part of the relationship. Similarly, victims can be protected in cases such as kidnapping 
and murder, where the running of news stories prematurely could either prevent the release 
of the victim or the apprehension of the suspect.7

2.3 

Cressida Dick, Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations in the MPS, expanded on this 
point:8

“…It’s very important that the public understand policing as much as they can, and 
also that they hold us to account, and they can only do that by knowing about policing. 
We need the public to help us in a variety of ways. Obviously we need information 
about crimes that have happened, but also we need people to have confidence in 
the police and in the whole system, so that they will give us intelligence or give us 
evidence, be witnesses, provide observation posts…” 

2.4 

2.5 

In his evidence, Sir Denis O’Connor described the importance of public opinion “…it’s another 
anchor point…in police legitimacy…with a measure of public sentiment, anything is possible. 
Without it, progress is very difficult…” 9 Further, the HMIC report, ‘Without Fear or Favour: A 
review of police relationships’, argues that the police are part of the community they serve 
and therefore need relationships with it, including with the media, to carry out their role 
effectively.10 

Given that the police operate with the consent of the public, the media also play a key role in 
holding the police to account by providing transparency and challenge. HMIC suggests that 
the police use the media for a variety of reasons, including to reassure the community they 
serve, to reduce the fear of crime, and to enhance public confidence in the Police Service. 
Furthermore,  HMIC  contends  that  the  overarching  principle  of  police  relationships  with 
the media is that the Police Service should not seek to constrain the media but allow them 
accurately to report news from which the principal beneficiary is the public.

GChapter 1 | Policing with Consent: The role of the press2.6 

Appropriate and transparent contact and communication between the police and the press 
is, therefore, crucial to ensure that this accountability is maintained. It might be said that, 
where relations are poor and there is insufficient engagement, public confidence will suffer. 
That was certainly the view of Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, the former Director of Public 
Prosecutions (DPP), in his evidence to the Inquiry. He explained, in relation to another key 
part of the criminal justice system, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), that when he took up 
the post of DPP “…there had been a long legacy of mutual distrust. I believe the CPS was seen 
by the media (and by the public) as opaque, remote and unaccountable…”.11 Lord Macdonald 
took the view that this was extremely damaging to the CPS and to public confidence in the 
criminal justice system more generally. As a result, he initiated a policy of closer engagement 
between the CPS and the media and argued that this impacted positively on the way that the 
CPS was portrayed by the media, not because journalists were somehow lulled into reporting 
on the organisation more favourably, but because it was able to speak to journalists more 
openly about the positives. More importantly, Lord Macdonald stressed that this openness 
emphasised the accountability of the CPS as a public service.12

2.7 

There  is,  therefore,  a  clear  and  overwhelming  public  interest  requirement  for  the  police 
to communicate with the public. The police, acting corporately, currently reach the public 
primarily  through  the  filter  of  the  media.13  For  this  reason  the  relationship  between  the 
press and the public is also vitally important: this serves to emphasise the significance of 
the concerns outlined in Part F of the Report. Peter Clarke, formerly Assistant Commissioner 
Specialist Operations in the MPS, sought to describe this interrelationship:14

“…there’s an extent to which the police interest and the public interest overlap, but 
overwhelmingly, the police exist to serve the public interest, so the public interest is 
obviously paramount.”

2.8 

A  close  and  transparent  working  relationship  between  the  police  and  the  media  is  also 
essential  to  guaranteeing  fair  reporting  and  effective  policing.  As  the  MPS  argued  in  its 
opening statement to the Inquiry:15

“Properly structured, such a relationship improves the scope, depth and accuracy of 
press reporting and enables the police better to perform their duty of protecting the 
public. It is through healthy and open contact with the police that the media are able 
properly to report on the criminal justice system. It is through contact with an honest 
and intelligent press that the police are able to engage and inform the public – not 
just with a view to solving crime but also as a means of warning and protecting the 
public where necessary.”

2.9 

Commissioner  Hogan-Howe  identified  five  areas  in  which  keeping  the  media  properly 
informed  about  policing  and  criminal  matters  was  critical  to  the  functioning  of  the  MPS 
(and, presumably, to the functioning of the Police Service more generally). First, through the 
media, the organisation is able to communicate its key messages regarding the prevention 
and detection of crime. Second, a healthy relationship with the media can serve to increase 
the public’s understanding of how the MPS goes about its work of policing London. Third,

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGthe relationship provides an important means by which the MPS can seek the assistance of 
the public in that work. Fourth, contact with the media, properly handled, serves to increase 
public confidence in the police and to promote a greater understanding of MPS policies and 
initiatives. Fifth, it provides the means by which the public can scrutinise police actions and 
policies. It also allows the police to test the persuasiveness of their strategies, policies and 
tactics. It is suggested that a plan that can withstand a searching press conference is usually 
at least credible.16

2.10  The importance of the relationship was echoed in the evidence throughout this part of the 
Inquiry by police and press alike. By way of example, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan 
Police Lord Condon told the Inquiry how strong relations with the media were “…essential 
and  in  the  public  interest.” 17  They  enabled  him  to  give  confidential  briefings  to  the  press 
on sensitive issues such as terrorism, preventing potential leaks that would have damaged 
police  investigations.18  Similarly,  Assistant  Commissioner  Dick  described  the  relationship 
as: “…crucial and important…”.19 In addition, many crimes were solved as a direct result of 
assistance from the media who communicate with the public at large.20 

2.11  As a counterpoint to this relationship, Sandra Laville, crime correspondent for the Guardian, 
argued,  I  have  no  doubt  correctly,  that  journalism  had  a  legitimate  and  proper  role  in  a 
democratic society to interrogate, challenge and question in the public interest or, in other 
words, to be the peoples’ eyes and ears.21 Mrs Filkin, in her evidence to the Inquiry, agreed 
with this contention and reiterated the importance of the police maintaining a strong working 
relationship with the media given the coercive powers afforded to policing.22 Mrs Filkin argued 
therefore that the police should actively protect proper scrutiny of their work:23

“…the police have very, very extensive powers, and those powers, for the rest of us, 
need to be under constant scrutiny, to make sure they haven’t overstepped their mark 
in the powers that they have and they’ve operated those powers properly.
Obviously, they have to do that themselves as well, but we need outside agencies 
who constantly also scrutinise what these very powerful organisations do, and the 
media  is  important  for  doing  that.  And  I  would  hope  that  as  an  important  public 
institution, the police would also see that they had a role in protecting that scrutiny, 
that that scrutiny was valuable to them in helping them do their job properly…” 

2.12 

It is clear that the MPS faces its own challenges in  ensuring that the public  are informed 
about the work of its officers and staff and the organisation as a whole. Mr Tim Godwin, 
formerly Deputy Commissioner of the MPS, observed that from 2000/2001 the media focus 
appeared to shift towards individuals, predominately to senior police officers.24 This, he said, 
replicated the rise of the “celebrity police chief” in the USA where individuals were credited 
with significant crime reduction in particular cities. Mr Godwin said of this media approach:25

GChapter 1 | Policing with Consent: The role of the press“…I thought that that actually undermined the efforts of lots and lots of people who 
were doing great things and that generally an individual wasn’t in themselves able to 
bring about things like crime reduction in a city like London.”

3.	 Tensions	in	the	relationship	between	the	media	and	

3.1 

the	police	
Dr Rob Mawby, lecturer in criminology at the University of Leicester, suggested that tension 
was endemic to the police-media relationship. Dr Mawby argued that this was understandable 
given that the media and the police occupied roles in public life that periodically brought 
them into conflict.26 As to the root of this tension, Dr Mawby offered this view:27

“The root of the tension is the different roles and objectives of the police and the 
media. The police are in place to detect crime, to maintain order. The media are there 
to maximise their audiences, to run successful businesses, and also to hold the police 
to account. So although they have things in common, there’s always going to be a bit 
of tension in that relationship, which will ebb and flow.” 

3.2 

On this point, Ed Stearns, Chief Press Officer in the Directorate of Public Affairs within the 
MPS, observed:28

“…the media will want to know everything, and there are reasons why the police, 
operationally or for personal – in terms of victims, well, I can’t give them everything. 
So there is a tension and I think it’s something that has probably been around for 
many years.”

3.3 

3.4 

Dr Mawby went on to suggest that this inbuilt tension in the relationship between the press 
and the police may actually be in the public interest, “…as long as that tension operates within 
a healthy framework, where the police are trying to be open and accountable and the media 
are trying to hold them to account and where there’s clear channels to pass information.” 29

This inherent tension sometimes leads to discontent on the part of the media that they are 
not receiving all the information they want, and concerns on the part of the police that the 
activities of the media may interfere with operational policing. In relation to the first point, 
for  example,  Adrian  Faber,  Editor  of  the  Wolverhampton  Express  &  Star,  complained  that 
there were often delays in the release of the names of people killed in road accidents or 
other incidents. Mr Faber fully accepted the need for the police to inform relatives before 
the details were released, but suggested that the release of the names of the deceased could 
take several days, by which time the information became journalistically worthless as it had 
already appeared in the social media as well as being known in the general community.30 

3.5 

In relation to the second point, the evidence the Inquiry has heard indicates that, particularly 
when high profile incidents catch the attention of the public and the media alike, the level of 
press interest can be enormous and, furthermore, that this can impact on police investigations.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG3.6 

3.7 

3.8 

Tensions in the relationship can also be caused by the individual needs of the different sections 
of the media. Lucy Panton, former crime editor of the News of the World, for example, said 
that as the ‘Sunday’ representative for the Crime Reporters Association (CRA) she had spent 
“years trying to better the police’s understanding on what Sunday newspapers needed from 
them. It has always been the case that police briefings are directed at meeting the needs of 
daily papers. I used these meetings to try and inform and change the way police used the 
Sunday papers.” 31

Jerry  Kirkby,  Assistant  Chief  Constable  of  Surrey  Police,  explained  that  following  the 
disappearance of Milly Dowler, Surrey Police media relations officers described the media 
demands made upon them as “alien”, “a steep learning curve”, “just immense”, “relentless” 
and “overwhelming”.32 Senior police officers involved in the case described elements of the 
press as “extremely demanding, and in some respects mischievous”, and the level of interest 
as  “unprecedented  and  immense”.33  The  unprecedented  demands  also  meant  that  some 
parts of the media felt that they were not being given the information that they required, 
and this led to some tensions.34

This tension in the relationship between the press and the police can also have unwanted 
consequences for those caught in the middle of a major investigation. Christopher Jeffries, 
who  was  arrested  in  connection  with  the  murder  of  Joanna  Yeates,  described  the  media 
interest in him as “enormous”. He said that he was effectively under house arrest moving 
between  friends’  houses  like  “a  recusant  priest.” 35  From  the  police  perspective, Detective 
Chief Inspector Philip Jones described it as “an unrelenting media interest from the point that 
Joanna was reported missing”.36 

3.9 

Dr Gerry McCann said of the media interest following the disappearance of their daughter 
Madeleine:  “Nothing  could  have  prepared  us  for  the  unprecedented  media  coverage, 
particularly  in  Portugal  and  the  UK  which  followed”  and  spoke  of  “the  intensity  of  media 
focus”.37

3.10 

In December 2006, following the discovery of the bodies of five young women in Ipswich over 
a ten day period, there was an explosion of press coverage. The Senior Investigation Officer, 
then Detective Chief Superintendent Stewart Gull, said that:38 

“the level of interest shown by not only the local and regional media but also national 
and international media was unprecedented”.

GChapter 1 | Policing with Consent: The role of the pressHe went on:39

“There  were  at  times  somewhat  I  considered  to  be  unhelpful,  unjustified  and 
unbalanced  media  reporting  which  at  best  was  misleading  and  at  worst  caused 
further anxiety and worry within the local community.”

3.11  For the duration of the investigation of the Ipswich murders, known as Operation Sumac, 
Suffolk  Constabulary  implemented  a  dedicated  media  strategy.40  One  of  the  key  lessons 
learned  from  this  was  that  maintaining  positive  media  relations  took  up  a  vast  amount 
of  time  for  the  officer  nominated  as  spokesman,  and  that  needed  to  be  accounted  for  in 
the investigative structure so that operational policing could continue effectively.41 Suffolk 
Constabulary took the conscious decision that all comment would be on the record and there 
was a constant drip feed of information provided to the media.42 Their handling of the media 
during this particular investigation was widely praised.43 

3.12 

In describing some of the consequences of this sometimes tense relationship, it is perhaps 
worthy of note that these sorts of events are rare for county police forces, but are certainly 
more  commonplace  for  the  Metropolitan  forces,  such  as  the  MPS,  Greater  Manchester 
Police, West Yorkshire Police and West Midlands Police. This is a theme to which I will return 
in subsequent sections of this Report.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGChapter 2 
the history of the relationship: 
Different approaChes

1.  Metropolitan police service: the Commissioners
1.1 

It might be said that the approach of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to the press has 
reflected, at least in part, the differing attitude of different Commissioners and the different 
treatment that holders of that post have received at the hands of the press. The Inquiry heard 
evidence from a number of recent Commissioners about these variations, and considered 
their views on the success or otherwise of each approach.

1.2 

1.3 

1.4 

Sir Robert Mark
The post of Commissioner of the Metropolis is unique given that the post holder is not only 
responsible for the policing of London but is also seen as the senior figure in British policing. 
The Commissioner is also personally responsible for the safety of Her Majesty The Queen and 
senior members of the Royal Family, wherever they are in the world.1

Sir Robert Mark, who was Commissioner between 1972 and 1977, likened the relationship 
between the police and the press to an ‘“enduring, if not ecstatically happy marriage”. He 
sought to establish a new approach to police-media relations in the capital.2 

On becoming Commissioner in 1972, Sir Robert was concerned that the senior ranks within 
the MPS had developed too many ‘fiefdoms’; this concern extended to the way in which the 
supervisory ranks dealt with the media. Sir Robert, who was one of the first Chief Officers to 
recognise and acknowledge that police corruption was widespread in several forms, decided 
relentlessly to drive down on it. He had a novel approach to tackling what he thought were 
unhealthy relationships between some of his senior officers and the press. The result was 
that, rather than restricting the amount of contact between his officers and journalists, he 
encouraged and allowed more. Sir Robert issued a new edict allowing all officers of the rank 
of inspector and above to talk to the media; that privilege had previously only extended to 
the superintending ranks. Sir Robert’s guidelines were simple: officers were allowed to talk 
about their own work but not about the work of others; he asked his officers to use their 
common sense in what was disclosed to the press.3  

1.5 

Lord Condon, another former Commissioner of the MPS, argued that since Sir Robert Mark’s 
tenure, the post had become irreversibly a very public post and that the Commissioner had 
become, and was expected to be, a “public figure”.4

1.9 

Lord Condon
Lord Condon was Commissioner from 1993 to 2000. He explained that the Commissioner was 
the public face of policing in the United Kingdom and therefore the post holder had to deal 
with the media at an entirely different level of intensity to any Chief Constable; he was able 
to use, as a point of comparison, the fact that he had previously been the Chief Constable of 
Kent. He said that there were times while he was Commissioner when his relationship with 
the media was completely dominating.5 

Lord Condon described how he sought to engage with the media in three ways: event-driven 
press  conferences,  planned  campaign-driven  media  events,  and  relationship-building.6  He 
used Operation Bumblebee, the operation directed at domestic burglary, as a good example 
of  the  second  type  of  engagement.  He  championed  these  campaigns  through  personal 
briefings with the media and interviews.7

Lord Condon also explained how he tried to meet with all print, television and radio editors 
at New Scotland Yard, their own offices or occasionally over a meal to discuss and promote 
his reform agenda and views on policing issues.8 As to whether he took the view that it was 
important  to  offer  greater  access  to  particular  parts  of  the  media,  Lord  Condon  told  the 
Inquiry,“…the Commissioner of the day, Chief Constable of the day, must be totally apolitical 
and must be totally without any favourites in the media, and so there has to be a “without 
fear or favour” approach to the media.” 9 

Despite these efforts at engagement, journalists perceived the culture of relations between 
the MPS and the media during Lord Condon’s period in office as being very restrictive and 
subject to tight controls.10 Lord Condon himself seemed to recognise this: he described how 
the Crime Reporters Association (CRA) meetings, for example, “petered out” during his tenure 
as Commissioner because he suspected that some of the crime reporters found them “a bit 
boring”.11

1.10  Lord Condon also accepted that his personal style of media relations, compared with other 
recent Commissioners, was to keep journalists at a professional distance. Nonetheless, he did 
not consider it,“…intrinsically wrong or morally or ethically wrong to be friendly or to have a 
social relationship…” with the press.12

Lord Stevens

1.11  When Lord Stevens took over as Commissioner in January 2000, it was widely acknowledged 
that the MPS was in crisis as a result of the Macpherson Report13. As a result, Lord Stevens

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGtook  the  decision  that  a  wholesale  change  in  culture  was  needed  and  he  embarked  on  a 
major strategy of engagement with the public.14 A key feature of this engagement strategy 
was developing a closer relationship with the media.15

1.12  This new approach was evident from Special Notice 19/00, A new policy for relations with 
the media, which I consider in greater detail later on in this Chapter.16 A major theme was 
to encourage police officers of all ranks to engage with the press, provided that they were 
qualified to do so.17 Lord Stevens also explained how he worked hard as Commissioner to 
foster good relations with the media by having lunches with the editors of all the national 
newspapers and the Evening Standard, and by making himself personally available to speak 
to journalists.18

1.13  Lord Stevens attempted to follow a policy of being open and transparent with the media, 
giving answers to legitimate questions without going into confidential areas. He felt that it 
was important to promote what the MPS was doing well but also to have frank conversations 
about what they were doing badly.19 The change in style between that of Lord Condon and 
that of Lord Stevens was described by Jacqueline Hames, a former Detective Constable with 
the MPS, in this way:20

“This all changed when Sir John Stevens became Commissioner in 2000 and introduced 
the current “open door” policy by which officers are positively encouraged, sometimes 
even ordered, to allow the media access to operations and to explain all aspects of 
their work.”

1.14  The  approach  to  media  relations  taken  by  Lord  Stevens  appears  to  have  been  generally 
appreciated by the press.21 Michael Sullivan, crime editor of The Sun, for example, said that:22

“When he was commissioner, Lord Stevens described crime reporters as part of the 
extended police family. This should not be taken out of context because he also applied 
the same description to members of independent advisory groups who worked closely 
with  the  Met  and  helped  move  themon  from  the  problems  around  the  murder  of 
Stephen Lawrence.” 

1.15 

Lord Blair
In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Blair explained that when he took over as Commissioner 
in January 2005 he thought that the MPS should spend less time on press matters; he felt 
in particular that discussion of media positions and opinions had become too consuming of 
senior officers’ time, although he did not consider Lord Stevens’ approach towards the media

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGto have been in any way improper.23 As a result, although he was keen to be open with the 
media, continuing to have working lunches with members of the press and meetings with the 
CRA on a monthly basis, Lord Blair had fewer social interactions, and no dinners, with editors 
and journalists.24 

1.16  Lord Blair had a much less positive experience of relations with the media during his time 
as  Commissioner.25  This  appears  to  have  been,  at  least  to  a  degree,  a  result  of  infighting 
and disagreements between senior officers, some of whom Lord Blair suspected of leaking 
information to the press about disputes within the MPS Management Board.26 

1.17  The sometimes fraught nature of the relationship between the MPS and the media at this time 
was recognised by journalists and police officers alike. For example, Mr Sullivan, contrasted 
the approach under Lord Stevens when “things ran pretty smoothly”, with that under Lord 
Blair, when there were “difficulties”.27 Lynne Owens, formerly an Assistant Commissioner in 
the MPS and currently the Chief Constable of Surrey Police, commented,“…I think we saw, 
during Lord Blair’s Commissionership, some commentary on his leadership in the media and I 
think that did impact on the relationship the MPS formed with the media.” 28 

1.18  The  Daily  Mail,  in  particular,  was  highly  critical  of  Lord  Blair  both  before  and  during  his 
Commissionership, although Stephen Wright, former Crime Editor and currently Associated 
News Editor for the Daily Mail, denied that the newspaper had “an agenda against him.”29

Sir Paul Stephenson

1.19  Sir  Paul  Stephenson  described  how,  upon  becoming  Commissioner  in  January  2009,  he 
was  concerned  about  the  largely  negative  commentary  in  the  press  during  Lord  Blair’s 
Commissionership;  he  believed  this  reflected  poorly  and  unfairly  on  the  MPS  and  was 
distracting for senior officers.30 Whilst he was Deputy Commissioner, Sir Paul had sought to 
ensure that there was a representative from the Directorate of Public Affairs (DPA) present 
during engagements with the media in an attempt to bring some structure to the relationship.31

1.20  Once Sir Paul became Commissioner he tried an approach of more openness and engagement 
with the press. Dick Fedorcio, formerly the Director of Public Affairs for the MPS, described Sir

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGPaul’s style as being “probably nearer to John Stevens in his style, in terms of his approach”.32 
Sir Paul emphasised the importance and relevance of the seven Nolan principles of public 
life,“…honesty, openness, leadership, accountability, selflessness, integrity and objectivity”.33 
He  also  attempted  to  improve  internal  communications  and  to  turn  all  50,000  or  so  MPS 
employees into effective media communicators.34 

1.21  More specifically, Sir Paul explained that he felt that some of the contact between the media, 
particularly the written press, and a small number of senior colleagues was closer than it 
needed to be.35 Sir Paul did not wish to identify the particular individuals, but clarified that he 
was concerned about leaks and gossip about disagreements within the Management Board 
of the MPS. This was damaging because it hindered efforts to have a full and frank discussion 
in relation to the issues of the day at management board level.36

1.22  Sir  Paul’s  approach  to  media  relations  was  successful  to  some  degree;  there  were  fewer 
leaks and, in his own words, fewer “newspaper stories about disfunctionality in the Met and 
disfunctionality at senior level” during his tenure.37 Kit Malthouse, the former Chair of the 
Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), now the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPC), 
described Sir Paul’s approach at the time as “ambassadorial” and explained that he was “very 
prominent at civic engagements and…he thought it was an important part of his role to get 
out and promote the good work of the Metropolitan Police to anybody who would listen.” 38 
However, it  would  be accurate to  say that MPS relations  with  the media  during  Sir  Paul’s 
Commissionership were overtaken by events in mid-2011, which I will address in more detail 
later on in this Chapter. These eventually culminated in his resignation.39 

Commissioner Hogan-Howe

1.23  The current Commissioner took up his post in September 2011. He has seen it as his role to 
return the relationship between the MPS and the media to what he describes as “a more 
considered and functional state”, following the furore caused by the phone hacking affair and 
the resultant instability and distortion in relations.40 Although Commissioner Hogan-Howe 
considered the media relations policy established by Lord Stevens to be in the right spirit, 
he was concerned that the approach had evolved over the years so that on occasions, in

relationship was too close.41

1.24 

I will deal with the current and future approach of the MPS to media relations in later sections 
of this Chapter.

2.  other police forces
2.1 

The Inquiry heard evidence about the approach to media relations taken by several police 
forces other than the MPS. Three important themes have emerged. First, it appeared to be 
universally accepted that the MPS faced unique challenges in terms of media relations in 
comparison to other regional forces. Lord Condon argued that “the Commissioner of the day 
is the public face of policing for their country, whether he or she likes it or not, and that brings 
with it certain demands”, and as a consequence he described the role of Commissioner in 
relation to the media as being “fundamentally different and totally more demanding than any 
Chief Constable’s role.” 42 Lord Blair reinforced this point, highlighting the MPS’s responsibilities 
nationally for counter-terrorism and the protection of the Royal Family, and its long history 
of policing both public disorder and political demonstrations.43 Chris Sims, Chief Constable of 
West Midlands Police, suggested that “I think there is a very different context in the Met to 
the context in which we operate outside…”.44 

2.2 

It  is  important  to  note  that  most  journalists  employed  by  national  newspapers,  including 
specialist crime reporters, are based in London. John Twomey, crime reporter for the Daily 
Express,  described  national  newspaper  crime  reporters  as  tending  to  be  “very  London-
centric”.45 It is part of a journalist’s job to build appropriate relationships with police contacts, 
and they do so principally with their local force, in this case the MPS. A number of journalists 
working  for  national  titles  gave  evidence  that  their  relationships  with  other  police  forces 
were  less  well  established.46  Timothy  Gordon,  editor  of  the  South  Wales  Echo,  suggested 
that “…I’d like it to be…clear that there is a huge difference between the regional press and 
what appears to be happening in the nationals…The regional press is a very, very different 
arena…”.47 

2.3 

The second theme to emerge from the evidence was the very different approach to news 
gathering between national tabloid titles and local media. The third theme to emerge was 
that different forces had tried different approaches to media relations over the years with 
differing results.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.4 

Media relations – the MPS and County Constabularies
The former Chief Constable of Cumbria Constabulary, Craig Mackey (now Deputy Commissioner 
of the MPS), expressed the view that although the MPS still dealt with local journalists in 
relation to borough-level issues there was:48

“…then the national dynamic that makes things very different around London, and 
that’s the national media effectively responding as a local media for London, and that 
does bring a different dynamic in terms of the demands and particularly the level of 
detail that’s required to service that.”

2.5 

The difference between London and other parts of the country was again echoed by Anne 
Campbell,  Head  of  Corporate  Communications  at  Suffolk  Constabulary.  She  said  this  in 
relation to the MPS:49

“…It has a unique place in not just the investigations but the issues it covers, because 
of course it carries out investigations on behalf of a number of the other forces as 
well, and I’m thinking about some of the international investigations where…there’s 
been cause to send people abroad to investigate. That tends to be the remit of the 
Met. So the Met’s local media, if you like, are the national media, whereas for most 
other forces it’s very much a local and regional media. So the Met is very different for 
a number of reasons.”

2.6 

The Chair of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Communications Advisory Group 
and  Chief Constable of the British Transport  Police (BTP), Andrew Trotter (who  previously 
served as a Deputy Assistant Commissioner within the MPS) pointed to the contrast between 
the  challenges  faced  by  the  MPS  with  regard  to  media  relations  and  that  of  a  regional 
constabulary. He said:50

“…the MPS is under intense media scrutiny almost daily, there is frequent contact 
between Directorate of Public Affairs and national journalists…As DAC I was often 
used  as  the  MPS  spokesperson.  As  a  result  of  this  experience  I  lecture  on  police 
training courses, and to foreign police audiences…When I arrived at BTP the contrast 
with  the  MPS  could  not  have  been  starker…There  was  one  press  officer  and  little 
contact with the media other than reactive responses in office hours when the one 
member of staff was available.” 

2.7 

A similar point was made by Sir Hugh Orde, President of ACPO. He said:51

“The  culture  within  the  MPS  will  inevitably  be  different  to  that  within  most  other 
police forces. This reflects the unique position of the MPS in managing some national 
policing  responsibilities  and  dealing  with  a  high  level  of  scrutiny  and  the  national 
media on a daily basis.”

2.8 

Sir Hugh went on to explain that the culture within the MPS towards the media was a “very 
different relationship” than that experienced by other constabularies because of “…the sheer

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGintensity and pressure and interest in what’s going on in London is fundamentally different 
even to the Police Service in Northern Ireland which is pretty busy...”.52 

2.9 

The differing attitude of the local and national press towards 
the police
An  important  factor  in  the  relationship  between  the  police  and  the  media  at  a  local  and 
national level is that local provincial forces have an existing working relationship with their 
local  and  regional  reporters  (including  regional  correspondents  for  national  titles).  They 
do not necessarily know or trust the national media who descend occasionally when a big 
story  breaks  and  have  little  or  no  regard  to  the  importance  of  establishing,  preserving  or 
maintaining any sort of relationship as long as they can deliver the immediate story.

2.10  Anne Campbell also spoke about the different attitude of local and national press towards the 
police. She felt that the national media were much more difficult to deal with than the local 
media. She described in particular how local journalists tended to provide a balanced and a 
“rounded view”, whereas the national media were “not so worried about putting our side of 
the story; in other words, that balanced view…” 53 

2.11  Liz Young, Head of Corporate Communications of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), 
noted  that  the  national  media  were  not  as  interested  as  the  local  media  in  developing  a 
future relationship. As a result, she argued that they were more likely to act unprofessionally 
by being over demanding or less sensitive to security issues.54 

2.12  Gillian Shearer from the Cumbria Constabulary said that the national media, in her experience, 
were  significantly  more  aggressive  than  the  local  media,  and  less  willing  to  adhere  to 
instructions  about  what  could  and  could  not  be  published.55  She  also  confirmed  that  the 
misleading  use  of  the  term  ‘police  source’  had  disappeared  from  the  lexicon  of  the  local 
media (this issue is considered in more detail in later in the Report).56,57

2.13  Amanda  Hirst,  Head  of  Corporate  Communications  at  Avon  and  Somerset  Constabulary, 
agreed that the media pressure in high-profile cases could sometimes be “intolerable” for 
senior  investigating  officers,  and  described  how  at  one  point  in  the  investigation  of  the 
murder of Joanna Yeates, she had advised Detective Chief Inspector Philip Jones not to watch 
the news or read the newspapers, such was the coverage that the case was receiving.58

2.14  An  element  in  this  sometimes  difficult  relationship  is  that  the  MPS  press  bureau  is  much 
better resourced than many local forces. The journalists who gave evidence to the Inquiry 
were  generally  positive  about  their  experiences  of  dealing  with  the  Directorate  of  Public 
Affairs (DPA), as a well-resourced operation working around the clock with a sufficient number

forces as providing a more limited service, for example with a lack of media trained staff on 
duty at the weekend.59

The different approaches to media relations

2.15  Chief Constable Chris Sims and Chief Inspector Sally Seeley, Head of Corporate Communications, 
from West Midlands Police, explained that their force had had a “very traditional relationship 
with the media”, that is to say a relationship that was reactive, “transactional” and very much 
driven by events.60 Despite West Midlands Police being a large force of 13,000 officers and 
staff, there were only 30 members of staff in the Corporate Communications department, 
which dealt with all types of communications, not just media relations.61 

2.16  Both  Chief  Constable  Sims  and  Chief  Inspector  Seeley  were  clear  that  they  could  find  no 
evidence  of  “informal  contact”  with  the  media  by  their  officers,  in  the  sense  of  social 
relationships with journalists; working contact was overwhelmingly captured and recorded 
by the press office.62 However, Chief Constable Sims conceded that there were still problems 
with leaks from time to time, although it was not considered to be a significant issue; he 
believed  that  these  occasionally  arose  as  a  result  of  disgruntlement  on  the  part  of  some 
officers or staff due to budget reductions or other difficult decisions.63

2.17  Chief  Constable  Peter  Vaughan  and  Catherine  Llewellyn,  Temporary  Assistant  Director  of 
Corporate Communications, gave evidence in relation to South Wales Police. Chief Constable 
Vaughan explained that the policy developed by that force required all ACPO rank officers 
and senior police staff to be accompanied to meetings and interviews with the media by a 
member of the media department, and for all contact to be recorded for the purposes of 
transparency. As a matter of practice, it was expected that this policy would be followed by 
more junior officers as well.64 

2.18  Chief  Constable  Stephen  House  of  Strathclyde  Police  explained  that  his  predecessor,  Sir 
Willie Rae, had kept a very low profile and took an approach of non-engagement with the 
media. This had led to some criticism.65 As a consequence, Chief Constable House decided to 
encourage a more open, proactive approach towards the media and had meetings with all

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGthe major newspapers and broadcasters at the beginning of his tenure as Chief Constable.66 
However, he also explained that he then gradually stepped back this level of engagement, 
principally to ensure that the force’s key messages were not diluted by a sense of media and 
public weariness.67 Chief Constable House told the Inquiry that he encouraged a similar policy 
to that of the South Wales Police, namely of having someone from the media department 
present  to  record  any  meeting  with  the  media.68  He  commented  that  Strathclyde  Police 
actively recruited journalists for their media department and would not be concerned if staff 
left to go back into the media; indeed, he thought that this would be a sign that they were 
good at what they did.69

2.19  Chief Constable Simon Ash of the Suffolk Constabulary described Suffolk officers and staff as 
being “very cautious in their dealings with the media”, leaving press relations to the Corporate 
Communications department.70 Chief Constable Ash said that he had almost no contact with 
the national media, but an excellent working relationship with the local media, particularly 
BBC Radio Suffolk.71

2.20  Chief Constable Ash described the Spotlight media information management system used 
by Suffolk and Norfolk Police; this was the same system used by the MPS.72 This system kept 
records  of  all  contacts  (whether  formal  or  informal)  with  journalists  and  politicians.73  In 
response to the concern raised by various journalists that such a system of record-keeping 
would cause communication by police officers to ‘dry up’, he argued that although, at that 
time, the Spotlight system had only been in place for four months, he had not detected any 
reluctance on the part of his officers to have contact with the press as a result. Indeed, he 
said:74

“…my bigger concern is ensuring police officers continue to notify the contacts. That’s 
where I think the weakest link in this process is, not so much the content…”

2.21  On the other hand, however, Terry Hunt, Editor of the East Anglian Press, was less convinced 
with this argument and thought that it would be a “step backwards” in terms of openness with 
the press.75 Colin Adwent, the East Anglian Press crime reporter, agreed that this approach 
“may well inhibit officers from talking to the press in certain cases” and thought that it would 
not be in the public interest.76

2.22  The former Chief Constable of Cumbria Constabulary, Craig Mackey, and Gillian Shearer, Head 
of  Marketing  and  Communications  for  Cumbria  Police,  explained  the  approach  to  media

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGrelations in that force. Cumbria encouraged senior officers to engage with the media; they 
were not currently required to record every contact, although this was something that was 
being considered by the force.77

2.23  Assistant Chief Constable Jerry Kirkby of Surrey Police discussed in some detail the experiences 
that  Surrey  had  with  the  media  during  the  Milly  Dowler  investigation  and  the  changes 
subsequently  made  to  the  press  office  as  a  result.78  In  particular,  Chief  Constable  Kirkby 
explained  that,  in  dealing  with  the  media  after  the  disappearance  of  Milly  Dowler,  Surrey 
realised that they needed to develop a better relationship with the national press. From 2002, 
therefore, Surrey Police fostered closer relations with the CRA; this subsequently developed 
into both more frequent formal briefings and several informal meetings in a social environment 
with CRA journalists which would take place in a restaurant.79 It was said that the purpose of 
the informal contacts with journalists was so that:80

“…senior  officers  and  press  officers  could  meet  with  journalists  from  the  Crime 
Reporters Association, understand their expectations and their needs and develop an 
understanding of working practices on that basis.”

2.24  Chief Constable Kirkby said that initially he found these informal meetings useful but, in late 
2010 following a Chief Officer group review, it was decided that the purpose of developing a 
good relationship and a better understanding of working practices had been achieved, and 
that “the context, public perception around austerity and socialising had changed”. The result 
was that they were discontinued.81

2.25  Chief Constable Colin Port of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary explained that when he 
had taken over as Chief Constable the force had been under attack by the media following a 
police standards review of the force; he therefore made “strong efforts to have a good, open, 
transparent relationship”.82 Chief Constable Port said that he considered Avon and Somerset’s 
policies and procedures on media relations (and gifts and hospitality) to be adequate, but 
did acknowledge that changes were made following the phone hacking revelations and the 
negative experience of Christopher Jefferies.83 

2.26  Chief  Constable  Jon  Stoddart  and  Barbara  Brewis,  Media  and  Marketing  Manager  from 
Durham Constabulary, said that the force had a “workable and trusting relationship” with 
their local media and that contact took place on a daily basis across all ranks, from the force’s 
police community support officers through to the more senior ranks.84 Ms Brewis described 
the force’s general approach to media relations as having “a good professional relationship 
with the media but they’re not your friends.” 85 Chief Constable Stoddart explained that the 
force  had  developed  a  high  level  of  trust  with  the  local  media,  in  particular,  without  any

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGculture of socialising, although he conceded that this was perhaps a function of the small size 
of the organisation and the location itself.

2.27  Ms Young explained that there was a practice in the Police Service of Northern Ireland of 
officers phoning the communications department after any contact with the media to inform 
them that it had taken place; a note would then be made to that effect.86 Expanding on this 
point, Ms Young explained that when the press office facilitated an interview with the media, 
the focus was on who was the most appropriate person to deal with the relevant inquiry; 
there was no restriction on the rank of officer or member of staff engaging with the media.

2.28  These  varying  accounts  from  regional  forces  illustrate  that  while  all  forces  placed  an 
importance  on  a  necessity  to  have  a  good  professional  relationship  with  the  media  there 
were varying degrees of engagement and openness. These differences are not due simply to 
the different media demands placed on those forces in comparison to the MPS, but also to 
fundamentally different attitudes. 

2.29  This, perhaps inevitably, leads to the question of national standards. Mr Fedorcio expressed 
the  view  that  some  national  standards  in  this  area  were  important  so  that  “there’s  no 
difference between one police force and another in how they go about in their relations with 
the press.” 87 Oliver Cattermole, Director of Communications for ACPO, agreed that the public 
would expect a consistency of approach in the form of national standards but cautioned:88

“…The  difficulty  or  the  tension,  if  you  like…in  terms  of  the  emphasis  on  devolving 
decision-making  to  a  local  level,  which  is  a  quite  prominent  theme  in  policing  at 
present, and therefore…getting the balance right between local interpretation and 
local policies and national framework is sometimes difficult.”

2.30  The need for some form of local variation was expanded upon by Chief Constable Trotter:89

“…There will be some local variation, and perhaps for a particular reason. An example 
might be the Metropolitan Police will allow inspectors and above to talk to the media 
without reference to the press office. In my force, the British Transport Police will allow 
any member of staff who has legitimate reason to talk to the press to do so. Much 
of that is to do with our geography and the fact that we won’t have an inspector on 
every location from Inverness to Truro perhaps in the middle of the night, so a lot will 
depend on local circumstance.” 

Chief Constable Trotter agreed that a commonality of approach between forces on important 
issues was sensible and, in respect of areas such as firearms policy, public order and force 
inter-operability,  essential.  However,  he  explained  that  whilst  national  guidance  could  be 
given to chief officers, it is they who were still in command of their forces, and there may be 
some legitimate reason for variation.90

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.31  Given the very real variation in force sizes and the varying demands placed on forces by the 
media, Chief Constable Stoddart agreed that a sensible approach would be to introduce a 
national set of high level principles which were then worked out on the ground and inspected 
against both internally and externally through Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary 
(HMIC). He said:91

“…the  solution…could  come  locally,  because  certainly,  you  know,  2,500  people 
in  Durham  Constabulary  and  45,000  in  the  Metropolitan  Police  –  the  scale  is  just 
ridiculous. So I don’t think that one size fits all is going to work. I do think national 
standards should be made clear. I think that somehow or other we have to enable there 
to be a local solution to come to that which is agreeable to those national standards.”

3.  press departments
3.1  When  analysing  the  development  of  police  press  offices,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  first 
attempt to formalise police-media relations followed the decision of Sir Nevil Macready, then 
Metropolitan Police Commissioner, to establish a ‘press room’ at Scotland Yard in October 
1919. The catalyst for the establishment of the Press Bureau was a number of police scandals 
arising from leaked information that originated from detectives within the MPS who were 
selling information to journalists in public houses. Sir Nevil sought to counter these informal 
communication channels with a more formal alternative. Dr Mawby, a lecturer of criminology 
at the University of Leicester, explained that it was not until the late 1960s that other forces 
followed the example set by the MPS and themselves established press offices.92 

3.2 

In the period that followed, these press departments developed to the extent that Dr Mawby 
described the label ‘press office’ as something of a misnomer. He suggested that what used 
to be headquarters-based press offices typically managed and partly staffed by police officers 
with a responsibility for reactive media liaison, had developed into departments responsible 
for internal communications, operational support, media liaison and public relations. They 
were now often called ‘Corporate Communications’ departments.93 Amanda Hirst, Head of 
the Corporate Communications Department for the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, agreed 
and explained that the term ‘press office’ was no longer adequate to describe the breadth of 
communications undertaken by the Police Service. She said that the Corporate Communications 
department was responsible for all aspects of internal and external communications of the 
Avon  and  Somerset  force,  including  proactive  and  reactive  interactions  with  the  media, 
campaigns, events, web and social media and internal communications.94 For the purposes 
of this Report, however, and particularly as many of the witnesses continued to use the term, 
“press office” will be used as a generic term for Police Service communications  teams.  

3.3 

The benefits
Chief  Constable  Trotter  argued  that  in  an  age  of  24-hour  and  seven  days  a  week  media 
coverage (that included social media), it was necessary for police forces to have a press office.

3.5 

He suggested that the day-to-day interaction between police forces and the media was of 
such obvious importance that forces could not adequately manage this relationship without 
dedicated personnel who had the appropriate experience, qualifications or training. Chief 
Constable Trotter explained that the media had a crucial role to play in appeals for information 
and also the dissemination of accurate information about incidents, investigations and police 
operations,  as  well  as  about  the  Police  Service  itself.  He  pointed  out  that  during  a  major 
incident or serious crime investigation there could be literally thousands of press enquiries 
to deal with, press conferences to arrange, public appeals to be broadcast, and websites and 
new media to be managed. All of these, he argued, were best dealt with by police media 
professionals rather than police officers. Chief Constable Trotter argued that the public and 
the media received a far better service from a force press office than by trying to track down 
busy front line police officers for information.95  

Chief  Superintendent  Derek  Barnett,  President  of  the  Police  Superintendents  Association  of 
England and Wales, agreed with this viewpoint and suggested that the presence of a press 
office had become a vital component for modern policing.96 Anne Campbell, in her capacity as 
Chair of the Association of Police Communicators (APCOM), suggested that the professional 
management of the media was a vital function for the Police Service as it directly impacted on 
the public’s perception of the Service as a whole and was indirectly related, in her view, to levels 
of public trust and confidence in the Service.97 Similarly, Sir Hugh Orde explained that within 
the context of the day-to-day activity of any police force, a press office performed an integral 
and specialist function. He suggested that the press office could be viewed as another specialist 
section within the police organisation, supporting the primary objective of keeping people safe. 
Just as modern police forces had access to, for example, experts in forensics, investigations, 
road  traffic  and  public  order,  he  suggested  that  in  a  similar  vein  Chief  Constables  required 
professional advice from a specialist media department so that they were able to make fully 
informed decisions in relation to that discipline.98 

Chief Constable Trotter explained that a key function of a police press office was to act as 
a conduit between the media and its officers. He suggested that by using press officers to 
organise interviews between police officers and journalists, a force could ensure that there 
was a proper reason for the interview, that there was a record of the interview (which was 
potentially subject to disclosure in criminal, civil or disciplinary proceedings), that the press 
strategy for the operation or crime investigation was being followed, that the police officer 
was  properly  prepared  for  the  interview,  and  that  all  proper  arrangements  were  put  into 
place.99  Joanne  Bird,  Head  of  Media  and  Marketing  for  the  British  Transport  Police  (BTP), 
expanded on this point and explained that every press office was there to help and support 
police officers in doing their jobs. She suggested that press officers were more efficient and 
effective at putting together press statements and appeals to the public than their operational 
counterparts  and,  furthermore,  that  this  fact  was  recognised  by  front-line  officers.  Ms 
Bird argued that the immediacy of the media’s need for news meant that the media could

inadvertently be an additional pressure on an operational response with the result that the 
press office provided an important support function.100 

Although  the  enthusiasm  for  police  press  departments  varied  between  witnesses,  the 
consensus view was that they were now a necessary component of a modern police force. 
Amanda Hirst suggested that “I think it is fair to say that the media suffer the existence of 
Corporate Communications Departments /press offices.” 101 Adrian Faber, editor of the Express 
& Star, Wolverhampton, shared this view, saying “Press officers can have a role to play as a 
central point of contact for a large force spread over a large geographical area. I suspect many 
journalists see them as a ‘necessary evil’.” 102 Others were more unequivocal in their views on 
this issue. Sandra Laville, crime correspondent for the Guardian, said “I would rather deal 
with officers directly but I can see with the vast amount of media requests police forces get, 
that press offices are essential.” 103 Jonathan Ungoed-Thomas, chief reporter at The Sunday 
Times, agreed and said “It is crucial for police forces to have a press office. The key role is to 
ensure a steady flow of information to reporters without unnecessarily hampering operational 
officers with inquiries and to ensure journalists working on an in-depth story speak to the most 
appropriate officer at the most appropriate time.” 104  Jerry Lawton, chief crime correspondent 
of the Daily Star, argued that press offices were necessary and explained that: 105

“Press  officers  are  (usually)  available  whereas  police  officers  are  frequently  too 
bogged down with all their other duties to talk. When a query emerges on a daily 
newspaper, speed of response is critical. Good press officers, who understand how 
newspapers work and journalists’ requirements, concerns and pressures, can actually 
help explain to reluctant officers on your behalf why it may be mutually beneficial to 
release certain pieces of information.”

3.7 

Disadvantages
Notwithstanding the fact that press departments are now considered to be a necessary and 
vital component of modern policing, the Police Service itself recognises that the media can 
sometimes  become  frustrated  by  this  additional  ‘layer’  or  conduit  to  direct  contact  with 
police  officers.  Chief  Constable  Sims  (from  the  West  Midlands),  whose  force  policy  was 
for individual officers to engage with the press office if approached directly by the media, 
acknowledged  this  point  in  his  evidence.106  Similarly,  Gillian  Shearer  (Head  of  Marketing 
and  Communications  in  Cumbria)  explained  that,  although  generally  speaking  the  media 
were comfortable going through the press office, sometimes they became frustrated if they

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGcould not get hold of all of the information that they required; often, therefore, they tried to 
approach officers directly.107 

3.8 

This sense of frustration was expressed by a number of witnesses.  Mr Faber suggested that 
the biggest culture change over the past few years in the relationship between the media and 
the police had been the introduction of press officers and argued that the referral of press 
enquiries to a press office had created a tier of bureaucracy between journalists and police 
officers.108 He expanded on this point and said:109

“…there is increasingly limited access to the actual police officers on the ground, and 
it tends to be that the press office is there to provide standard information and if we 
want to go further than that and find out more, we will try to go to the individual 
officers, but sometimes we are referred back to the press office.”

3.9  Ms Laville shared this viewpoint and suggested that adding another layer between a journalist 
and a police officer who had information to convey could lead to delays, some inaccuracies, 
and often to a lack of depth in the information provided. She argued that this was partly 
the reason why Lord Stevens had introduced the policy within the MPS of allowing middle 
ranking officers and above to talk openly to journalists in the interests of accuracy, context 
and a wider understanding of the issues.110 

3.10  There was also recognition amongst some of the regional police forces that the media would 
like to see increased access to force press offices. Chief Constable Baggott, speaking about 
the Press Office of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, for example, said “We do know that 
the media would like the press office opening hours to be extended to 24/7 however given 
budget constraints this is not possible.” 111 The Guardian reporter, Nick Davies, expanded on 
this point, describing from his point of view the difference in the service provided by a press 
office in a big city force and that provided by a smaller provincial force. He said:112

“That was something I came across talking to provincial reporters…some of them 
complained that the press office of the local police force was so understaffed that the 
routine was that they would call the press office and get a recorded message saying, 
“Here’s the story we’ve selected for you today”, and they would just be expected to 
copy that down and put it into the paper. They couldn’t even pursue it. Close to that 
also is press officers posting stories on websites, their own websites, for journalists 
to put into the paper, and there’s a big reporting problem with that, because you’re 
allowing the police force to make all of the editorial decisions about what should be 
reported and with angle and language and quotes…it’s not being done for malicious 
motives. It’s about shortage of resources cuts, not enough press officers, whereas a 
big city force like the Met, I don’t come across that. You can get a human being on 
the end of the phone.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG3.11  Mr Davies also suggested that, with rare exceptions, press officers saw it as their legitimate role 
to protect the interests of the organisation or individual for whom they worked. He argued that 
whilst it was unusual for a press officer purposely to mislead a journalist (given that it would 
undermine their future credibility), when under pressure, some press officers did occasionally 
lie to reporters in order to protect their organisation. Mr Davies went on, however, to say 
that, more commonly, police press officers would hold back information that might embarrass 
their employer, or promote information which tended to enhance the reputation of the force 
concerned.113 

3.12  Mr  Lawton  supported  this  viewpoint  and  said  “I  think  a  large  part  of  their  role  [a  force 
press office] is to ensure the force is portrayed in as good a light as possible. That is only 
natural  particularly  in  tough  financial  times  and  amid  rumours  of  force  mergers.” 114  Mr 
Faber suggested that although his journalists tended to get the information that they were 
seeking from the press office, he was sometimes frustrated in having to deal with the police 
agendas of ‘reassurance of the public’ and ‘risk assessments’. He argued that this manifested 
itself in the police view that the public had an exaggerated perception of crime which was 
fuelled by media coverage; as a result, the police took the view that unless it was helpful in 
an investigation, they would not automatically release the information.115 

3.13  Commissioner Hogan-Howe argued that what might be described as reputation management 
was an important consideration. He made it clear, however, that “I wouldn’t use the words 
‘reputation management’, but I do think public information is vital to make sure the public 
are informed about what their Police Service is trying to do on their behalf”.116  In dealing 
with this issue, Chief Constable Vaughan suggested that all press officers, certainly within 
South Wales police, were aware of their responsibility to be open, honest and transparent 
and would always try to give as much information as they could. He argued that press officers 
would never withhold information from the media because, internally, it was perceived to be 
negative or unpalatable. Chief Constable Vaughan explained that if information could not be 
released or queries could not be confirmed or placed in context, then press officers would 
use their professional judgment to respond accordingly, seeking legal advice if necessary. He 
suggested that, on the occasions where the police were unable to service the needs of the 
media as comprehensively as they would like, this could sometimes lead to a perception that 
press officers were being unhelpful or obstructive.117 

Respect for exclusives

3.14  A large number of the witnesses that gave evidence emphasised the importance of trust in 
the relationship between the police and the media so as to allow it to function effectively and 
in the public interest, particularly in the context of confidential briefing.118 It was argued that 
police respect for media exclusives was an important facet of that relationship of trust.

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesG3.15 

In  relation  to  this  issue,  Barbara  Brewis,  Media  and  Marketing  Manager  for  Durham 
Constabulary,  said  that  “No  media  outlet  is  given  preferential  treatment,  although  if  an 
individual reporter becomes aware of a story or issue exclusively it would be unprofessional 
not to take this into consideration when planning how we distribute information.”119 In this 
context, Ms Brewis provided the specific example of a recent major fraud investigation. She 
explained that the BBC and one of the force’s local newspapers had become aware of the 
police’s activities and “as police enquiries were at a very early stage, we asked both reporters 
concerned if they would hold back from running stories in case the main suspect was alerted 
and went ‘to ground’. Once he had been arrested we told the reporters and provided enough 
information for them to run stories, ahead of any other media outlets.”120 She explained: 121

“…If a reporter comes and asks a question about a story they are running and nobody 
else has it, I think it’s only professional to honour that exclusive. I would not put it 
then out on general release. I may put it out on general release once it appeared in 
that outlet, but I wouldn’t do it in advance of that.”

3.16 

Jon Ungoed-Thomas, Chief Reporter for The Sunday Times, argued that police respect for 
exclusives were particularly important for Sunday newspapers. He suggested that he would 
seek  one-to-one  briefings  for  this  reason  –  he  explained:  “…what’s  absolutely  vital  for  a 
Sunday newspaper is you’re not sitting there with seven other journalists, because you’ll pick 
it up in the newspaper the next day and you’ll read it, so you want to be on your own and you 
want to have one-to-one briefings.”122

I am satisfied that the interim ACPO guidance for relationships with the media adequately 
deals with this issue for both sides. It stipulates: 123

“Media organisations should be treated in a fair and equal manner. This means that 
once in the public domain, information released by the police should be available to all. 
Where a media organisation generates an ‘exclusive’, their right to share information 
in confidence with the police should be respected. It may be appropriate for the police 
to work with a particular media organisation on an issue (such as with a local paper 
campaigning against a local crime issue), where it serves a policing purpose to do 
so [my emphasis]. All media organisations have the right to consideration for such 
opportunities.
On some occasions it may be necessary to briefly delay the release of information 
to the media to ensure that resources are in place to respond to public feed back, 
for  example  an  appeal  for  witnesses  or  information,  where  officers  need  to  be 
immediately available to respond to arrest named suspects.”

The Directorate of Media and Communication

3.18  The relationship between the MPS and the media is now managed by the Directorate of Media 
and Communication (DMC). The DMC came into being on 1 April 2012, having previously

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGbeen known as the Directorate of Public Affairs (the DPA); the overwhelming majority of the 
witnesses that appeared before the Inquiry therefore referred to the body by its old name.124 

3.19  The DMC is a large department with significant demands placed on its time and resources. 
For 2011-12, it had an allocated budget for 69 members of staff with a total expenditure 
of £6.7 million.125 This can be compared, for example, with the equivalent departments in 
the West Midlands Police (a staff of 30), Strathclyde Police (a staff of 25), and South Wales 
Police (a staff of about 20).126 The majority of DMC staff, some 45 out of 69, are press officers 
attached to the News Branch and are tasked with providing media support as the principal 
contact point between the MPS and the media. The remaining members of staff deal with 
internal  communications,  e-communication,  marketing  and  publicity.127  The  DMC  News 
Branch consists of a 24-hour, seven days a week press bureau, which is often the first point 
of  contact  for  the  media.  There  are  five  specialist  desks  dedicated  to  supporting  the  four 
main functional commands within the MPS: Specialist Operations, Specialist Crime, Central 
Operations and Territorial Policing and the corporate desk.128  

3.20  Ed Stearns, chief press officer at the DMC, made it clear that the directorate was far more than 
a call centre.129 He explained that the DMC engaged in a much wider breadth of work. Each 
call required a considered response and, in some cases, it was necessary to prepare press 
lines and to liaise with police officers or police staff.130 Responding to media inquiries was 
only one of the DMC’s main functions. Mr Stearns explained that it was also responsible for 
marketing, advertising, social media, co-ordinating the corporate stakeholder engagement of 
the MPS and much of the internal communication for the entire organisation.131 

3.21  Notwithstanding the role of the DMC, it has consistently been the policy of the MPS to devolve 
media contact to operational officers, and to permit officers of a suitable rank to speak to the 
media about their own areas of responsibility. The current Media Relations Standard Operating 
Procedure (SOP) for the MPS states that officers below the rank of Inspector can speak to the 
media with the authority of their line manager, and officers of the rank of Inspector and above 
are authorised to speak to the media about their own areas of responsibility (unless there 
is  a  specific  media  strategy  in  place  or  a  dedicated  spokesperson  identified).132  There  are, 
therefore, over 2,000 officers of Inspector rank and above who are authorised and encouraged 
to speak to the media.133

3.22  The scale of press contact is considerable. The MPS services some nine national newspapers, 
eight Sunday newspapers, five national television channels, plus two 24-hour media channels, 
a wide variety of digital channels with their associated documentary content, two national

and a wide range of minority, specialist, online and international organisations. The DMC also 
has the names of over 1,000 journalists and organisations on its media database, all of whom 
have asked the MPS proactively to provide them with information. In addition, at any one 
time, there is at least one documentary for national television being undertaken. This is in 
addition to the reactive work of responding to media press inquiries.134

3.23  As set out above, the Inquiry has heard a significant amount of evidence that the position 
of the MPS is very different to that of regional forces. Its major local daily newspaper is the 
Evening Standard;135 but this feeds into the national newspapers for the following day and 
it  therefore  has  significance  beyond  most  local  papers.136  As  the  Commissioner  observed, 
anything  that  happens  in  London  as  the  capital  city  may  not  just  be  nationally  significant 
but may also have international ramifications, “A murder here with a foreign link can often 
have  an  impact  beyond  anything  that  we  can  sometimes  anticipate.” 137  In  contrasting  his 
experience as Chief Constable of Merseyside with that in the MPS, Commissioner Hogan-
Howe suggested that:138

“…for  many  reasons,  the  dynamic  with  the  press  here  is  quite  different,  and  then 
finally [there is] the impact of the 24-hour reporting through the mass media. The 
pressure of that here…it’s pretty voracious…So I think that impact in London – I can’t 
say by what factor, but it’s hugely amplified to my experience which I saw in South 
Yorkshire and in Merseyside…”

3.24  The DMC handles some 120,000 media calls a year with over half of them going to the press 
bureau at Scotland Yard. In an average week, the DMC gets between 200 and 300 calls a 
day. By way of illustration, at the peak of the public disorder on 9 August 2011, the number 
of daily calls rose to over 1,700 and remained at approximately 1,200 on the 10th and 11th 
August 2011. Mr Fedorcio argued that it was essential, both for the police and the media, 
that the DMC handled these calls, the alternative being that they would go directly to police 
officers who would then be prevented from attending to policing duties.139 In 2011, the DMC 
News Branch issued 1,008 news releases, arranged 447 media facilities including interviews, 
press conferences, briefings, visits and attendance on police raids, made reference to 396 
successful court cases, supported 100 murder investigations and attended 316 Gold Groups 
(a Gold Group is a senior strategic decision-making body made up of experienced and senior 
or specialist staff) meetings.140

3.25  Media management information within the MPS is held in a database called Solcara (now 
known  as  Spotlight).141  Mr  Fedorcio  explained  how  Solcara  worked  in  practice.  A  record 
was kept in relation to individual cases and incidents. That record would initially contain a 
description of: (i) the information that the DMC had been given, (ii) who had provided that 
information, and (iii) the time that the information had been given. A discussion then took 
place between the relevant personnel within the MPS, and decisions were made as to the

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGapproach to be taken in relation to the release, or alternatively non-release, of information 
to the media. A record was then made of: (i) what information the MPS was able to offer to 
the media (‘for offer’), (ii) what information the MPS may provide if it was asked to do so (‘if 
asked’), (iii) information that third parties had released, which was known by the MPS and 
which may be released by the MPS, making it clear when it was released that its source was 
a third party, and not the MPS (‘non attributable’), (iv) information in possession of the MPS, 
such as information on reporting restrictions, or the date and time of a briefing by an MPS 
officer, which may be released to the media but was not for publication by them (‘not for 
publication’), and (v) information that was not for distribution to the media (this may include 
confidential or sensitive details of a victim or of a person arrested and was referred to as 
‘Bureau information’).142 The Spotlight system is now being adopted by a number of other 
forces too.143

3.26  Despite the important function performed by the DMC, there has been some criticism of 
its  behaviour  and  practices.  Elizabeth  Filkin,  in  her  report  The  Ethical  Issues  Arising  From 
The Relationship Between Police And Media, recorded the excellent work that was done by 
the DMC (then the DPA), but nevertheless highlighted her serious concerns about what she 
had been told about the reluctance of some police officers to provide information to the 
DPA because of two perceptions. First, there was the perception that in some instances the 
DPA had been unwilling to provide information to the public. Second, that, again sometimes 
only, information was misused. Mrs Filkin suggested that the impact of those perceptions, 
regardless  of  the  facts,  was  damaging  because  they  fuelled  surreptitious  briefing  and 
hampered  an  effective  and  transparent  corporate  response  in  providing  information  to 
the public.144 Kit Malthouse, formerly the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime in London, 
suggested that the DMC was dominated by its relationship with the news media and said:145

“…it’s a common trap that communications departments fall into, which is that they 
migrate,  because  of  the  nature  of  the  news  media,  its  immediate  demands,  the 
reactive nature of it, they migrate to thinking that news and using the news media 
is the only way to communicate with the public, whereas of course there are many 
other forms of communication, and I raised this with the Commissioner and with the 
head of the DPA, that I felt it would be beneficial for the Met to move away from 
merely a concentration on news towards other forms of communication…”

3.27  Michael Sullivan, crime editor of The Sun, said that he believed that the MPS compiled “charts” 
on individual reporters and a system of “grading” or marking to illustrate whether they were 
deemed to be favourable to the MPS or not.146 The MPS strongly denied this claim and Mr 
Stearns  asserted  that  the  DMC  did  not  keep  charts  on  individual  reporters.  He  explained 
that the DMC, as part of its public relations function, did carry out media monitoring, but

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGsuggested that this operated at a very general level with no focus on particular reporters.147 It 
is sufficient for me to conclude that I have seen no evidence of a grading system and neither 
has  any  evidence  been  produced  that  has  analysed  the  extent  to  which  those  who  have 
provided favourable coverage to the MPS have been rewarded with consequential favourable 
access or other benefits as a result.

3.28  Sean O’Neill, crime correspondent for The Times, said that he found the DMC “less than frank” 
and that they “quite often give a partial picture”.148 Mr O’Neill provided a specific example 
where  he  suggested  that  the  MPS  had  been  obstructive  over  the  release  of  footage  in  a 
major court case (however, he did concede that this example was based on his understanding 
from colleagues rather than it being a first hand experience).149 From the other perspective, 
the MPS, through Mr Stearns, argued that in that particular case the DMC had in fact taken 
positive steps to secure the release of the footage to the press.150 In summarising his position, 
Mr O’Neill said that although the relationship between the media and the MPS waxed and 
waned, he found the MPS to be defensive and protective of its image and reputation.151 

3.29  A number of journalists suggested that the MPS, and the Police Service more generally, had 
withdrawn from the media since the Inquiry had been convened and because of the general 
publicity surrounding phone hacking. Mr O’Neill, for example, said of the MPS that, “there is 
a different relationship between the police and the press, and I suppose that’s an inevitable 
consequence  of  what  happened  last  summer”.152  In  relation  to  the  Police  Service  more 
generally, Mr Gordon, editor of the South Wales Echo, suggested, for example, that the police 
seemed to be more hesitant about making contact with the press than previously.153 Indeed, 
Chief Constable Trotter confirmed from his conversations with journalists that there was a 
sense that some police forces had closed down slightly in their dealings with the media.154 
However, Mr Stearns argued that the suggestion that the MPS had withdrawn from disclosing 
information to the media was not the result of any policy of the DMC. Rather, he suggested, it 
was more likely that journalists had formed this impression because individual police officers, 
who  had  become  personal  contacts  of  journalists,  no  longer  wanted  to  engage  with  the 
media to the same extent because of the current climate of resignations and arrests.155 This 
viewpoint was supported by some journalists who agreed that it was informal contact with 
police officers that had become more difficult.156

3.30 

It is also clear that recent events have had an effect on the way in which some journalists 
interact with police officers. This point was illustrated by Commissioner Hogan-Howe who

described his attendance at a social event. It transpired that he was seated at the same table 
as an editor that he had not previously met. The editor made a conscious effort not to look at 
him for 20 minutes and after about an hour had elapsed said “I wasn’t going to speak because 
I wasn’t sure that we could.” 157 

It  is  perhaps  unsurprising  if  recent  events,  including  the  establishment  of  this  Inquiry, 
have affected the personal behaviour of individual police officers in relation to the media. 
Commissioner Hogan-Howe was prepared to accept the potential criticism that the pendulum 
in the relationship between the police and the media may possibly have swung a little too 
far in the other direction, but said “I prefer, I think, to be criticised for setting the boundary 
too high than I would by…having set it again too low”.158 Notwithstanding this point, the MPS 
argued that the DMC were fully conversant of the tensions between operational policing and 
the media appetite for information and were keen that police officers continued to engage 
with the media.159 

3.32  Overall, in quantifying the extent to which there is a need for a recalibration of the relationship 
between the media and the MPS it is important to note that the balance of the evidence 
has demonstrated that the general relationship between the press and the MPS is good and 
healthy. Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick’s view was that almost all of the culture within 
the MPS in relation to its dealings with the press was “very healthy and professional”.160 

Head of communications

3.33  The West Midlands Police have a long standing policy that the head of their communications 
team  was  a  serving  police  officer  rather  than  a  communications  specialist.161  This  role  is 
currently performed by Chief Inspector Sally Seeley.162 Her responsibility, as Head of Corporate 
Communications, is to lead that team and to have strategic oversight of the department as a 
whole.163 The appointment to this post is for a limited period – approximately two years.164 In 
Chief Inspector Seeley’s view, the advantages of this system, as a police officer with 20 years’ 
service, were that she possessed a degree of objectivity beyond that shown by professional 
communicators and, additionally, she was able to add real context and an understanding of 
policing to the work undertaken by the communications department. She believed that this 
provided support to the team. She also considered that the relatively short period of the 
appointment meant that the relationships formed remained professional and objective.165

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesG3.34  There were mixed views as to whether this policy was a good idea but, insofar as it is possible 
to discern a consensus, it was broadly against the arrangement. Chief Constable House of 
Strathclyde Police was firmly against it, and said:166

“…I’m aware that there’s been some discussion about would it be a good idea to have 
a senior police officer running the media set-up of a police force. In my view, that would 
be a retrograde step. I think most police forces have been there. It’s not somewhere I 
would choose to go, personally, because there is a professionalism within media and 
communications which is not the natural strong suit of police officers…”

That being said, Chief Constable House did accept that there might be some value in having a 
senior police officer focused on communications within a force area for a time limited period. 
However, he believed that the alternative model, as in Strathclyde, was preferable. This saw 
an expert head of communications sit on the management board, where they were subject to 
the scrutiny and questioning of the Chief Constable, his Deputy, his Assistant Chief Constables, 
the Director of Finance and Resources, and to the “cut and thrust of the management of 
the organisation on a daily basis”.167 Rob Shorthouse, Head of Corporate Communications 
for Strathclyde Police, agreed, arguing that the role of head of communications was “a post 
better held by somebody that has the necessary skills, experience and qualifications”.168 

In relation to the presence of the head of the DMC on the MPS management board, Lord 
Blair suggested that it was appropriate not least because the role also encompassed internal 
communications. He understandably suggested that the Commissioner and the management 
board would want to communicate directly with their officers and staff. His view was that 
the  Evening  Standard  and  other  papers  were  “a  very  important  aspect  of  communicating 
to the 53,000 people who worked in the Met.” 169 Lord Blair suggested that this method of 
communicating  with  the  organisation’s  staff  was  an  important  way  of  contextualising  and 
triangulating information outside of the MPS’s own internal publications.170 

I can see value in both approaches to this issue. There is certainly some force in the notion 
that  a  police  officer  brings  objectivity,  an  increased  understanding  of  operational  policing 
and context to the role. It might also be argued that a time limited appointment, such as 
is in place for Chief Inspector Seeley, necessarily ensures that relationships do not become 
too close with particular editors or media outlets; this is certainly a risk if the Director of the 
Communications Operation is in post for many years. On the other hand, a suitably qualified 
senior officer, with the necessary skills, would have to be found and taken off operational 
policing duties. I also accept that, provided suitable and robust oversight and line management 
arrangements are in place, there is real value in a professional lead providing police forces 
with the expertise necessary for both internal and external communication services. 

3.35 

3.36 

3.37 

In the circumstances, I consider that this decision is ultimately one for Chief Constables to 
make based on their own experience of their force, the local media and the issues in the 
area that they police. If, as I accept is the case, Chief Inspector Seeley and the West Midlands 
Police, for example, find their system works for their area, it would not be appropriate or right 
for me to recommend (let alone suggest the imposition of) a different approach. Similarly,

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGgiven  the  different  experience  of  the  MPS  (and  in  Strathclyde),  provided  measures  are  in 
place to prevent the development of a relationship of overfamiliarity or friendship which I do 
not believe is in the public interest and which may come from exceptionally lengthy periods 
in post, nor would it be sensible or appropriate for me to recommend that the arrangements 
adopted by such forces should be changed.
Crime Reporters Association

3.38  One of the themes to emerge from the evidence was the relationship between the Crime 
Reporters Association (CRA) and the MPS, along with the probity and potentially extensive 
contact that this is said to have provided between crime reporters who are members of this 
‘club’ and police officers.

3.39  The CRA is a long established forum for national newspaper and broadcast journalists working 
in the field of crime, law enforcement and home affairs. It has existed in its current form 
since  shortly  after  the  Second  World  War.171  Jeff  Edwards,  the  Chairman  of  the  CRA  from 
1993 to 2009 and currently its President, said that its raison d’etre was to promote better 
understanding, cooperation and good working practice between those journalists within its 
membership  and  the  police  and  other  branches  of  law  enforcement.172  The  CRA’s  current 
Chairman is John Twomey.173 

3.40  Mr  Edwards  and  Mr  Twomey  both  provided  an  overview  of  the  CRA  in  their  evidence  to 
the Inquiry. Mr Edwards explained that the CRA currently had 45 members,174 and that the 
criteria  for  inclusion  within  the  Association  were  that  members  must  be  employed  by  a 
news  organisation  that  operated  nationally  or  was  staffed  to  “national  news  organisation 
standards”.175 The CRA had members from the main broadcast news media outlets (BBC, ITN, 
Sky), all national daily and Sunday newspaper titles (with the exception of The Sunday Times, 
although its reporters had been invited to join),176 and, additionally, the Press Association. 
The  Evening  Standard  crime  correspondents  were  also  members  because,  although  the 
Evening Standard only circulated in London and the Home Counties, it was staffed to national 
news  organisation  standards.177  Mr  Edwards  explained  that  the  CRA  was  funded  by  its 
members with an annual membership of £30 although members were also asked to make 
a contribution towards the annual Christmas party (£40 in 2011).178 The police provided no 
input into membership which was entirely controlled by the CRA itself.179

3.41  Although theoretically the CRA covers all of the UK police territory, in reality it is primarily 
focussed  on  London  and  the  South  East180  and,  therefore,  crime  reporters  on  regional 
newspapers outside this area do not benefit from membership. As to whether this is an issue, 
it  is, in any event, true to  say that many local  newspapers  do  not  have a specialist crime

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGreporter at all. Indeed, Colin Adwent, senior crime reporter for the East Anglian Daily Times 
and  Evening  Star,  Ipswich,  said  that  he  had  never  felt  limited  or  inhibited  by  not  being  a 
member of the CRA or an equivalent body.181  

3.42  Looking at the specific relationship between the Metropolitan Police and the CRA, Mr Stearns 
explained that historically the MPS had hosted a formal monthly briefing with the CRA. The 
briefing  was  normally  led  by  the  Commissioner  and  was  an  opportunity  to  address  any 
topical issues, allow the Commissioner to answer questions and to provide an opportunity 
for officers with a specialist knowledge on a variety of issues to brief those present on a range 
of operational or policy work. CRA briefings still occurred but were now rotated with different 
members of the management board of the Metropolitan Police, including the Commissioner, 
leading them.182 Furthermore, Mr Stearns explained that in around 2005, Mr Fedorcio and 
Peter Clarke, formerly Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations, had agreed 
that there was a need for the media to be better informed about terrorist related issues and 
the threat to the United Kingdom. It was therefore decided that a regular but informal lunch 
meeting would be held with rotating members of the CRA to allow for a general discussion 
between  police  officers  and  reporters  who  were  experts  in  their  field.183  The  CRA  lunch 
briefings were organised through the DPA press office and a press officer always attended; 
it was understood that the subject for discussion was always non-reportable.184 Mr Twomey 
explained that since the resignations of Sir Paul Stephenson and John Yates in the summer of 
2011, the CRA lunch briefings with senior officers had ceased.185 

3.43  The CRA and the DMC also both hold a number of what are described as ‘informal networking 
opportunities’ each year, attended by both senior officers and the media. Mr Stearns said that 
the purpose of the functions (normally an evening over the Christmas period, and sometimes 
also an evening in the summer) was to develop working relationships, understanding and 
confidence.186 In relation to other forces, Mr Edwards explained that in recent years Surrey, 
Thames Valley, Kent, Hampshire, Sussex, the City of London and one or two other forces had 
held what he described as modest, get to know you social evenings for CRA members, either 
at the force headquarters or a hired venue.187 There were also occasional briefings or press 
conferences about specific events, some of which were described as off-the-record.188 CRA 
members also met with and contacted police officers and staff individually.189  

3.44  Mr  Edwards  described  the  CRA  as  operating  in  a  similar  way  to  that  of  the  lobby  system 
amongst Parliamentary correspondents and suggested that it afforded members of the CRA 
some additional access to some police forces, including the MPS, especially at times of crisis

Gor major events.190 Mr Edwards conceded that the status of the CRA may, to a certain extent, 
provide members with privileged access to the police.191 However, he emphasised that all 
major news organisations were represented by the CRA.192 Mr Edwards also explained the 
value of the CRA, suggesting that it provided a more detailed and nuanced level of engagement 
with police forces for specialist reporters who covered crime and policing issues,193 as well 
as offering what he described as a “talking shop” in which misunderstandings between the 
police and the media, along with difficult issues, could be debated, explained and resolved.194 

3.45  This  view  was  echoed  by  Paul  Peachey,  crime  correspondent  for  The  Independent.  He 
described the CRA as “useful as a conduit between the police [and press]…there are briefings 
that are organised perhaps to make it less unwieldy, just purely for the crime reporters.”195 
He also explained that whilst the membership criteria for the CRA “used to be fairly strict” 
the criteria were now less strict, so that some freelance journalists were members making 
it a “fairly broad church”.196 Michael Sullivan, a committee member of the CRA, agreed and 
noted that membership had been expanded to include home affairs correspondents as well 
as crime reporters, partly as a result of suggestions from the police that it should be more 
representative of the national and London regional news outlets.197 Mr Sullivan also explained 
how CRA members were trusted with more information than less specialist journalists:198

“…The  purpose  of  the  CRA  is  really  a  group  of  journalists  who  specialise  in  crime 
reporting.  Through  the  group,  as  it  were,  we  would  hope  to  be  trusted  with 
information  perhaps  brought  in  on  –  not  sensitive  information,  but  could  be  told 
things in confidence which might put context to a story, might not necessarily be for 
publication,  but  would  influence  what…we’re  writing  in  the  newspaper,  or  indeed 
broadcasting through radio or television.”

3.46 

Justin Penrose, crime correspondent at the Sunday Mirror, reiterated the relationship of trust 
between the CRA and the police and described the relationship between the CRA and the 
MPS. He suggested that the relationship had built up over the years to the point where police 
officers trusted the integrity of the CRA’s members. As a result, he explained that officers 
were able to give members some context in relation to stories and, while informing them of 
the facts, felt able to tell them if a story they were planning to run could affect future police 
operations or prevent arrests from taking place. Therefore he suggested that the relationship 
had worked to a mutual benefit.199 Mr Stearns described CRA members as having a greater 
understanding of policing issues than, perhaps, might be the case for a general reporter; this 
could also include a greater awareness of issues such as the impact of a story on operations 
and how such problems could be avoided. This meant that the police could proceed with

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGa briefing on that basis and meant that an explanation about the basics of tactics or case 
history was not needed at the start of each briefing.200

3.47  This theme was expanded on by Stephen Wright, associate news editor of the Daily Mail, 
who suggested that the CRA could operate in the public interest. He said that the confidential 
briefings  by  the  MPS  to  CRA  members  in  July  2005,  at  a  time  of  unprecedented  national 
security concerns, were “an excellent example of teamwork between the press and the police. 
And the CRA was at the heart of that.” 201 Mr Stearns also suggested that from a public scrutiny 
perspective, the CRA was valuable because members’ specialist knowledge normally allowed 
them to ask the right questions so as to ensure that the MPS was held to account where that 
was required.202 
Jacqueline Hames gave her views on the power wielded by the CRA. She said:203

3.48 

…it’s sort of a cultural thing, almost, within the police service, and certainly within 
a  high  level  of  investigators,  you  know,  who  are  at  the  top  of  the  major  criminal 
investigation  sections  –  you  know,  specialist  crime  directorate  and  anti-terrorist 
function  and  things  like  that  –  who  have  spent  many  years  developing  their  skills 
and contacts as police officers and establish relationships with journalists over many, 
many years, sometimes even close friendships, and if a new person coming into that 
– it’s not an easy place for them to get established because it becomes, by human 
nature, a gentleman’s drinking club and that’s what it was for many years. I don’t 
know if that’s the case now, because I’m detached from it, but certainly for many, 
many  years,  it  was  known  as…a  very  close-knit  group  of  people  who  would  have 
access to information that some police officers don’t have.”

3.49  Ms Hames suggested that a recommendation should be made to institute a review of the 
role of the CRA to ensure transparency in terms of its access to information.204 Mr Edwards 
acknowledged that there was a need for more transparency from both sides (i.e. the police 
and CRA),205 but he was anxious to avoid a “draconian approach”;206 in the main, he considered 
that the relationship between the CRA and the police had been successful and beneficial to 
all parties, albeit that it required constant maintenance and adjustment.207 

3.50  Despite  the  acknowledged  need  for  some  additional  transparency  and  proportionate 
adjustments to the relationship, Ms Hames was the only witness to express real misgivings 
about the CRA. Other journalists did not see any real problems with it; that applied both to 
those who were currently members208 and to those who were not.209 Mr Stearns did not think

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGthat the CRA was a ‘clique’ but rather he considered them more to be experts in their field.210 
Lucy Panton, formerly the crime editor of the NoTW, described how there was a competitive 
rivalry amongst CRA members,211 which may seem to suggest that the CRA was not an overly 
cosy club. Jonathan Ungoed-Thomas proffered the view that he missed nothing important by 
not being a member of the CRA and therefore being absent from the CRA briefings. He said:212

“…I’ve never covered a major crime story, for instance in London, we’re talking here 
about the Metropolitan Police, where it’s been raised as an issue that we have missed 
a significant part of the story because we didn’t attend a briefing and whether we 
should now consider becoming a member of that association. It’s never been raised 
with me as an issue, and I’ve never, in terms of Sunday newspapers and the coverage 
that we cover, ever seen anything where we’ve significantly missed something which 
I later found out as a result of those briefings.”

3.51  Lord Condon reinforced this point of view and said of the CRA:213

“…I wouldn’t have briefed them if I felt it was a desperately exclusive sort of small 
trade body that gave special access. To me, it seemed that every major crime reporter 
around in London was part of that, as were those involved with the electronic media, 
and I guess it was a handy way, once every month – or certainly, latterly, it was every 
few months – them having the opportunity to discuss things which were of interest 
to them…” 

3.52  The CRA forms an important part of the picture of relations between the press as a whole 
and the MPS. The police themselves view the CRA as a useful group whose membership is 
not exclusive in any problematic sense. I can see the benefit to both sides of having specialist 
crime  reporters  and  a  forum  for  them  to  get  together  to  share  expertise  and  provide 
appropriate liaison with the police. However, it is clear to me that there is a need for both the 
MPS and the CRA to take positive steps to ensure that the relationship is a transparent one, 
and that its membership remains as wide and as open as is consistent with its function. I see 
no reason why a journalist who has the necessary specialist knowledge should be excluded 
either because of the title at which he or she works or the location of that title: it would be 
a matter for the journalist whether he or she wishes to attend briefings in London (which is 
obviously where they would be held). 

3.53 

I do not consider that it is necessary for me to be dogmatic about how these aims can be 
achieved: rather, it is best left to be worked out by the MPS (doubtless with the advice of the 
newly formed DMC) and the CRA. I have no doubt that transparency of purpose, membership 
and meetings along with appropriate publication of membership and minutes will serve to 
ensure that any suggestion that the CRA is a restricted club can be dispelled. It would also 
be important that anyone who wishes to join the CRA knows how to go about it and fully 
appreciates the extent of knowledge or involvement in crime reporting required.

Chapter 2 | The History of the Relationship: Different ApproachesGCHAPTER 3: 
THE PRESS AND THE POLICE: THE HARM AND 
THE RESPONSE

1.	
1.1 

Introduction
This  Chapter  of  the  Report  will  examine  the  generic  evidence  called  during  the  course  of 
Module  2:  in  other  words,  the  broad  sweep  of  the  evidence  bearing  on  the  relationship 
between the press and the police, and the conduct of each. The essential question is this: did 
that relationship become too close? But in order to answer that question it is necessary to 
examine a range of specific issues in which different facets of that essential question fall to 
be addressed and answered. At the heart of this matter are serious issues of police integrity 
and public perception which will need to be examined in this Chapter of the Report at length 
and with care.

2.	 The	use	and	abuse	of	information

2.1 

2.2 

Forewarning of the press
In opening this Module of the Inquiry, Robert Jay QC identified the issue of the press attending 
incidents or newsworthy occasions because, it had been suggested, they have been tipped 
off  by  the  police  (or,  at  least,  certain  police  officers)  and  the  media  (or,  at  least,  certain 
journalists). This section considers and investigates this issue.

Hugh Grant gave evidence to the Inquiry on this topic. It is representative of the testimony 
the  Inquiry  received  in  that  it  does  not  amount  to  unequivocal  evidence.  It  is  compelling 
nonetheless:1

‘This came at the zenith of the sort of press storm around that arrest in Los Angeles. I 
was now back in London, holed up in my flat, and I’d managed to get out for the day, 
or the night – I can’t remember. Anyway, when I came back, this flat had been broken 
into. The front door had been basically just shoved off its hinges. As I say, nothing was 
stolen, which was weird, and the police nevertheless came around the next day to 
talk about it, and the day after that a detailed account of what the interior of my flat 
looked like appeared in one of the British tabloid papers. I can’t remember which one 
at the moment, but it was definitely there, and I remember thinking: who told them 
that? Was that the burglar or was that the police? And when I told this story to Tom 
Watson recently, the MP who was writing a book about this kind of thing, he nodded 
knowingly, saying, “Oh yes, that particular method of break-in I’ve come across with 
several other people who are victims of a lot of – in the crosshairs of a lot of the press 
attention, and it doesn’t seem to have been a singular occasion.”’

G“All I know is that for a number of years, although it did get better in recent years, if 
someone like me called the police for a burglary, a mugging, something in the street, 
something that happened to me or my girlfriend, the chances are that a photographer 
or reporter would turn up on your doorstep before a policeman. So whether you call 
that supposition or fact, I don’t know.”

2.3 

Elizabeth  Filkin,  the  former  Parliamentary  Commissioner  for  Standards,  within  her  report 
‘The Ethical Issues Arising From The Relationship Between Police And Media’, made mention 
of tip offs. The report records that:3

“It is also said that the media is sometimes tipped off by police officers and staff who, 
as part of their job, have come into contact with celebrities or others in the public 
eye. Some parts of the media pay members of the public for such information and 
may have paid police in similar circumstances. Whereas this may be legitimate for 
members of the public, it is understood, across the MPS, that it is not legitimate for 
the police.” 

Mrs Filkin expanded on this point in her evidence to the Inquiry and said:4

“…  from  what  I  was  told,  it  went  across  that  whole  range.  Some  of  it  was  about 
people allegedly ringing up in excitement to the newspaper to say that, “Celebrity 
X has just come into my police station”, and when that poor celebrity got outside, 
there were lots of cameras there because the media had delivered the cameras. But 
people also said to me that they thought that in some instances people were paid for 
information about celebrities …” 

2.4 

2.5 

It  is  true  to  say  that  Mrs  Filkin’s  report  provides  no  specific  example  of  celebrity  tip  offs, 
nor does it conclude that there was firm evidence to suggest that the practice takes place. 
That being said, however, Brian Paddick, formerly a Deputy Assistant Commissioner in the 
Metropolitan  Police  Service  (MPS),  suggested  that  the  arrest  of  suspects  for  the  21  July 
2005 failed bombings could not have been filmed and broadcast live “without inappropriate 
collusion  between  the  press  and  the  police”.5  Mr  Paddick  went  on  to  note,  however,  the 
real danger was that if the media were tipped off before a raid took place, then somebody 
may tip off the suspects leading to their escape;6 it might be said, therefore, that in those 
circumstances it was extremely unlikely that police officers engaged in such a raid would tip 
off the media.

Furthermore,  former  Assistant  Commissioner  Peter  Clarke,  in  his  evidence  to  the  Inquiry, 
provided an alternative explanation as to how the media became aware of the arrest of the 
suspects in Mr Paddick’s example. Mr Clarke explained that the operation on 29 July 2005 went 
on for several hours and involved the evacuation of a block of flats, police cordons and firearms 
officers. He suggested that given the amount of local disruption that was caused as people 
were evacuated from their homes, it was highly likely that the media would have been alerted.7 
Indeed, Mr Clarke noted that during this period in 2005, every time the police mounted a high 
profile operation with armed officers present the media turned up very quickly.8

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.6 

Although he could not provide a specific example of a tip off that he had received from a police 
officer or someone working for the police regarding a celebrity, James Murray, Associate News 
Editor at The Sunday Express, stated that he was unsurprised that when the police went to 
arrest a celebrity the photographers were already there;9 he said:10

“…  I  have  been  lucky  enough  to  be  on  the  receiving  end  of  a  phone  call  when 
somebody’s said they’ve got a good story about so-and-so, and you say, “Thanks very 
much”, and you make further enquiries to establish the accuracy and the veracity of 
the story, and then it may be that a short time later you ring up your contact, your 
source, and say, ‘Would you like to have a little drink or would you like to have a cup 
of coffee or would you like to have a meal by way of thank you for being helpful in 
that matter?’ … it can be a police source. It can be a member of the public who’s 
got information about a crime. I mean, the sources can come from a multitude of 
different ways.” 

2.7  When  talking  about  leaks  to  the  media  more  generally,  Chief  Constable  House  from  the 
Strathclyde  Police  also  suggested  that  tipping  off  may  occur.  Again,  he  could  provide  no 
concrete examples, but said:11

“… it’s an estimation, because I haven’t done that analysis – I would say most of them 
do [leaks to the media concerning celebrity cases] because that’s effectively where 
the money would be, so yes, it’s the newspapers, the reporters and the photographers 
being on the doorstep of the police office as a celebrity is released and of course that 
shouldn’t happen. So we backtrack as to how did that happen and the view is that is 
a leak from the organisation and we investigate it.” 

2.8 

2.9 

Assistant Chief Constable Kirkby of Surrey Police confirmed that one of its officers was under 
investigation in relation to a leak about celebrity information.12 Lord Stevens, when discussing 
the issue of tip offs, expressed condemnation for the practice but had no recollection of it 
actually happening during his Commissionership.13

Conversely,  there  was  a  significant  amount  of  evidence  to  suggest  that  there  is  no  such 
practice  or,  to  put  it  slightly  lower,  that  the  practice  is  certainly  not  prevalent  within  the 
police service; and media sources are more likely to be members of the public or information 
obtained in other ways.

2.10  Evidence  on  this  point  was  provided  by  Sandra  Laville,  a  journalist  of  some  23  years’ 
experience.14 She said that she had never been tipped off by the police in relation to the arrest 
of someone of interest, nor was she personally aware of the practice happening.15 When asked

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGabout photographers being present as people of interest were taken away from their homes 
or photographs being taken as they emerged from police stations, Ms Laville said:16

“… I’m not aware where that information is coming from, and I’m not aware of my 
colleagues or other people on other papers being told by police officers. I am not 
aware of that.”

2.11  Michael Sullivan, a crime reporter of some 21 years standing,17 provided the Inquiry with 
similar evidence. He could only recall one instance where he had received information in 
relation to the arrest of a celebrity which allowed him and other journalists and photographers 
to be present when the police arrived; however, that had been a ‘tip’ from a fellow journalist 
and not the police.18 He suggested that there was a misconception in relation to the practice 
of tip offs and said:19

“… I think what you’re seeing on television and in the newspapers where there are 
photographs of celebrities or well-known people who have been arrested then coming 
out of a police station, what will happen is if the newspapers become aware through 
whichever means that somebody is under arrest, a group of photographers, reporters 
from all papers and camera crews may well … try and go to the police station where 
that person is being held. They won’t necessarily be told where they’re being held 
by the police. In fact, in my experience it’s quite rare that they would. But you would 
split it up in a practical working, practical way, split up the work of one paper or one 
photographer goes to this police station, another goes to that police station. I mean 
I’ve  known  occasions  in  our  own  office  where  we’ve  had  teams  of  three,  perhaps 
four photographers going out to different police stations trying to find out … which 
one they’re being held at … there are various means … for … information about the 
arrest of people to come out, and very often it might be released by that person or 
the arrested person’s own PR.”

2.12  Although  formally  informed  of  proposed  raids  and  arrest  operations  on  several  occasions 
through the MPS press office, Mr Twomey could not recall an instance where he had been 
advised  informally  about  arrests  or  raids  by  the  police  before  they  had  taken  place.20  In 
relation to the attendance of journalists and photographers at the arrest of a celebrity he 
said “I have never experienced that”,21 but did acknowledge that he was aware of that sort of 
thing occurring.22

2.13  A  number  of  other  journalists  gave  similar  evidence.  Paul  Peachey,  crime  correspondent 
of The Independent, said that on the occasions that he had been given prior warning of a 
raid they had been through official channels and not a secret tip off.23 Jon Ungoed-Thomas, 
chief reporter at The Sunday Times, said that on the one occasion that he had received prior 
notification  of  a  raid  or  arrest  it  had  been  provided  to  him  through  the  press  office  with

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthe  approval  of  senior  police  officers;24  Mark  Hughes,  crime  correspondent  of  The  Daily 
Telegraph, also made the same point.25 Jerry Lawton, chief crime correspondent for The Daily 
Star, said that where he had been given off-the-record prior warning about pending arrests 
it was usually to stop the publication of a story which could hamper the investigation.26 He 
also reiterated that he had never been tipped off about a celebrity arrest.27 Scott Hesketh, 
crime reporter for The Daily Star Sunday, also said that he had only received off-the-record 
information either relating to a proposed arrest that was confidential and not for publication 
or about plans to drop charges on a controversial case.28 

2.14  Sean  O’Neill,  crime  editor  of  The  Times,  made  a  similar  point  and  said  that  on  the  small 
number  of  occasions  that  he  had  been  given  prior  notification  of  an  arrest,  it  had  been 
because he had been persistently asking questions of the police about an investigation or 
that he was proposing to write stories which the police had been concerned might inhibit 
an ongoing investigation. The police had therefore shared information with him, under strict 
embargo, to preserve the security of the operation.29 

2.15 

In reinforcing the points made by Mr Sullivan, Justin Penrose from the Sunday Mirror offered 
the following view:30

“In my experience, a lot of celebrity stories tend to be from members of the public or 
people that are associated with those celebrities rather than from the police. I think 
there’s a real perception that the police are a leaky sieve, and in my experience that’s 
not necessarily been the case.” 

2.16  Tom Pettifor, crime correspondent for The Daily Mirror, confirmed that he had never been 
offered a story about the involvement of a famous person with the police, either in the role of 
a victim or as the subject of an investigation, by a police officer or a member of police staff.31 
Stephen Wright, associate news editor at the Daily Mail, also suggested that it would be wrong 
to assume that information on crime stories necessarily came from the police. He observed:32

“…  I  use  a  wide  variety  of  independent  sources.  Crime  reporting  is  like  piecing 
together a jigsaw. In my work I have had professional dealings with the Home Office, 
prison  and  probation  personnel,  victims  of  crime,  campaign  groups,  police  staff 
associations, politicians, lawyers and freelance journalists. Furthermore, many of my 
most important stories came after I followed a particular case for a number of years 
and stayed in touch with the various people involved.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.17  Ed Stearns, chief press officer at the MPS, also supported this viewpoint and in similar terms. 
He said that formal notification of a proposed raid or arrest, as described by Mr Twomey 
for example, should not be confused with the media just “turning up” on operations or at 
arrests without press office involvement. He suggested that this could take place for a variety 
of reasons: neighbours had called the media; there was traffic disruption leading to media 
inquiries; or because photographers were already at or aware of the location of a celebrity’s 
home and were regularly keeping a watchful eye out for activity.33 Mr Stearns reported that 
the MPS had also, on occasions, been aware of tip offs being given by lawyers or publicists 
of the individual involved, including an example where the identity of a celebrity who was 
the victim of an assault was revealed to the media by personal contacts and not the police.34 

2.18 

2.19 

In  summarising  the  evidence  that  the  Inquiry  has  received  on  this  issue,  much  has  been 
of a general nature from which legitimate inferences may be drawn, but there is no direct 
evidence to suggest that the police have given unauthorised tip offs to the media in respect 
of celebrity arrests or other raids. However, as Mr Stearns conceded, although he had no 
direct evidence that media presence at a raid or arrest had occurred as a result of a tip off 
within the police, through a process of elimination it was sometimes difficult to identify an 
alternative source for the information.35 That being said, there is an obvious danger in making 
assumptions as to the provenance of sources where the media attend police raids or the 
arrest of a celebrity; and the press, in particular, were not slow to suggest that there could be 
any number of alternative avenues whereby the information had been disseminated amongst 
the press. I deal with the issue of leaks of information more generally later in this section, but 
it is sufficient at this stage to make the point that the more robust the systems and processes 
in place to mitigate the risks of leaks within an organisation the better. 

It is, however, sensible to go one stage further. It should be a matter of serious professional 
concern to the police that information about their activities which should be kept confidential 
is, indeed, confidential. The presence of the press at a high profile arrest may, indeed, provide 
positive coverage although, unless very carefully handled, it may also give rise to difficult 
issues of fairness within the criminal justice process. Obviously, if, for good reason, a decision 
has been taken to brief the press about a forthcoming arrest and to allow representative 
attendance, the risks (and the responsibilities to the target of an arrest) should have been 
calibrated  and  taken  into  account.  If  there  is  no  such  authority,  however,  and  there  is  a 
legitimate inference that someone (whether police officer or civilian employee of the police) 
has leaked the information to the press generally or a journalist specifically, I do not take the 
view that this is ‘just one of those things’. 

2.20  The professionalism required of police officers must be sufficiently robust to instil the mindset 
that such leaks about forthcoming arrests or the involvement of the famous in the criminal 
justice system are not in the public interest and that the provision of appropriate briefing as 
to police activity should only be handled through open and transparent procedures which 
have taken account of all relevant circumstances: they should not be by the back door. This is 
not the same as ‘whistle blowing’ when I recognise that very different considerations apply.

Involvement of the press in operations

2.21  Colloquially known as “Ride Alongs” or “Tag Alongs”, this is the phenomenon whereby the 
media are given a specific invitation to accompany the police during a raid or other operation.

785

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGThose members of the media invited to accompany the police are given special access to, 
and  advance  notice  of,  operations  which  ordinarily  would  not  be  publicly  known  about 
beforehand. 

2.22  The rationale behind the involvement of the press in operations is to help improve public 
understanding of the work of the police through seeing them at work and the challenges they 
face, thereby dispelling any misconceived perceptions. This process (which it is said has been 
successful) is referred to by the Directorate of Media and Communication (DMC) as “Taking 
Media on Operations”.36

2.23  Taking the media on operations is governed by a formal MPS policy37 and, more generally, 
by the ACPO ‘Communication Advisory Group 2010 Guidance’.38 The MPS policy states that 
taking the media on operations should be considered where it would:39

be of significant public interest;

(a) 
(b)  help  to  prevent  disorder  or  crime  (for  example,  by  acting  as  a  deterrent  to 
criminals or that informing the public of police action could lead to greater public 
confidence and co-operation); and
improve the media/public understanding of police practices and procedures.

(c) 

The policy is clear that the media must not be taken on any operations involving juveniles, and 
advises that officers should consider whether it is likely that a media presence could interfere 
with an individual’s right to their private and family life, their home and correspondence, 
or with an individual’s right to a fair trial. Both of the aforementioned rights are obviously 
protected  by  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  (ECHR).  In  addition,  the  policy 
stipulates that where the media are invited to attend police operations, their involvement 
must be strictly controlled.40 

2.24  The ACPO guidance is broadly similar and advises that there is no law to prevent police forces 
taking the media on operations, although this is subject to the salutary reminder to forces 
that there are laws which may affect media reporting, for instance (and, in particular) those 
designed to ensure a fair trial. The guidance suggests that forces should consider whether:41

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

the project addresses matters which are in the public interest;
it is likely to inform or reassure the public; 
it will help prevent or detect crime.

The guidance also identifies risks for consideration, including the possible interference with 
an individual’s right to a fair trial or privacy, the distress or harassment which may be caused 
to  those  being  investigated  or  to  innocent  members  of  the  public,  and  the  potential  to 
jeopardise future police operations.42

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.25  A number of witnesses gave evidence to the Inquiry on this issue. Lord Condon suggested 
that there were arguments for and against the practice. On balance, he felt that it was “in the 
public interest if done correctly, with very clear parameters”.43 He cited Operation Bumblebee 
as an example, in which the media were invited along to observe and report on arrests for 
the  purpose  of  publication,  of  reassuring  the  public,  and  to  act  as  a  warning  to  potential 
burglars and to be seen to be doing so in such numbers as “transferred fear from the public 
to burglars”.44 Lord Stevens had encouraged officers to take the media on police operations, 
where  appropriate,  as  he  believed  that  it  would  benefit  the  police,  the  media  and,  most 
importantly in his view, the public. He recognised that there were risks involved but felt that 
these should not prevent the police from becoming more open and flexible with the media.45

2.26  Mr O’Neill told the Inquiry that occasionally police forces formally invited the media to go on 
early morning raids during which suspects were arrested; he provided the example in London 
where  this  was  often  done  with  the  Commissioner  or  Mayor  as  part  of  an  anti-burglary 
initiative.46 Mr Sullivan provided similar evidence; he said that once every year or two he was 
invited on mass raids with other journalists to promote specific campaigns on issues such as 
burglary, domestic violence and uninsured or stolen cars. He suggested that because of the 
increasing political interest in policing, invitations also now came from the Mayor’s Office.47

2.27  Lucy Panton, formerly the crime editor at the NoTW, spoke in favour of the practice. She 
believed that it was in the public interest to allow journalists to shadow the police during 
specific operations, as it gave the public an insight into what was normally a “closed off and 
secretive  world”  and  showed  the  good  work  and  sometimes  complex  nature  of  what  the 
police had to deal with on a day-to-day basis.48 Ms Panton could recall seven occasions when 
she had accompanied the police on raids and operations, two of which occurred before she 
worked at the NoTW and two of which appeared to have been as the direct result of NoTW 
investigations. In relation to her time at the People and the NoTW, she argued that:49

“As  a  Sunday  paper,  it  is  incredibly  hard  to  find  different  and  exclusive  lines  on 
breaking stories such as arrests which generally happen on weekdays. An opportunity 
to witness first hand an event like this was beneficial to our readers and in the public 
interest.”

2.28 

In respect of the MPS, Dick Fedorcio suggested that there was “almost a rota”50 in place for 
inviting the media on operations in London and that a journalist would normally be invited, 
from the Press Association for example, to act as a pool who would then “pool everything 
back in for everyone else to have.”51

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.29  There were mixed views as to the utility or acceptability of arrangements whereby journalists 
were invited to accompany the police on operations. Mr Penrose explained that he had, on 
a small number of occasions, shadowed the police on operations and recalled two specific 
examples: first, where he had accompanied the police in an armed response vehicle, and 
secondly relating to a stop-and search operation targeted at knife crime.52 He provided his 
view on whether the practice was a good thing:53

“I think it’s a good thing because … I think what’s being lost so far over this period of 
months is the good things that the Metropolitan Police and other police forces do. I 
mean, the idea of going out with the armed response vehicle was to sort of give some 
kind of idea as to what armed officers do on a daily basis and to give the public a 
general overview of what they do …”

2.30  Ms  Laville  said  that  she  had  in  the  past  shadowed  the  police  on  operations  but  had  not 
done so for a long time because she felt that she did not get much out of the process.54 She 
explained:55

“…  it’s  all  about  the  official  lines  of  the  Metropolitan  Police  showing  themselves, 
whatever they want to show, whether it’s being tough post the riots or being tough 
on drug gangs or being tough, currently, on street gangs. I’m not sure you’d get much 
out of it beyond a picture of someone being arrested, a door being broken down … It 
is of interest, but it’s only of interest if I flesh it out with other information. You know, 
there’s currently at the moment going on an anti-gang operation in the Metropolitan 
Police. We don’t seem to be able to get access to that at the moment. All we seem to 
get at the moment is being bombarded with facts and figures and information, which 
is pretty meaningless without context and colour and texture and more of an insight, 
and I don’t think you really get that from just going along, riding along like that.”

2.31  Chief Constable Vaughan of the South Wales police, saw value in the media joining the police 
on operations but felt that it must be proportionate.56 Mr Vaughan recalled the experience 
of his force engaging with some programmes which, in retrospect, he regretted. He provided 
the specific example of a programme called “Traffic Cops”, and said:57

“… I think it’s a hugely popular show, but it keeps being reshown on different satellite 
channels, and perhaps some of the behaviour that you see on that isn’t the behaviour 
that you would want reflected into the wider community … it’s a number of years 
since the last time that the show came to South Wales Police. Some of those instances 
aren’t the organisation that I want to reflect as being representative of South Wales 
Police.”

2.32  Mr  Vaughan  conceded  that,  perversely,  the  programme  had  provided  the  force  with  an 
opportunity to observe the unsatisfactory way in which some of his staff had behaved: it had

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGthen allowed them to tackle that issue.58 Given his experiences, Mr Vaughan suggested that 
inviting journalists to accompany the police on operations was a double-edged sword and 
had shaped the way in which the force engaged with the media.59 He said:60

“Very important to us is what … can we get out of it? What are the media trying to 
get out of it? I think it’s very important that we’re held to account for our activities 
and it’s important that the public see that policing isn’t just about knocking down 
people’s doors, discovering cannabis plants and dealing with violent people. There’s 
a whole host of roles that my officers and staff deal with, so for us now, if we do have 
any requests, it tends to be to look at the other functions, the other individuals that 
help the police force – help us ... to do the job on the front line.” 

2.33  Whilst there may be a clear public interest in informing the general population that the police 
are taking appropriately robust action in relation to specific crime types, it is at the same 
time self evidently vital that the identity of the subject of the investigation is protected – 
certainly at the point of arrest. This point was acknowledged by Commissioner Hogan-Howe, 
who was of the view that taking the media on police operations had a place in explaining to 
the public, through the press, what was happening in their local communities, provided that 
there was no identification of the suspect and that there was no risk to the judicial process.61 
He expanded on this point and said:62 

“… usually great care is taken to make sure that, first of all, the press who are at the 
event are chaperoned. They have no right of entry into the properties so they should 
not go into the properties. Number two is that the individuals who are the suspects 
and are the subject of arrest when you get there, or were being sought when you 
arrived, are not identified, and there should be nothing, the written nor the visual 
accounts, that allow that to happen. It is really to get the story that the police are 
taking action in an area about a particular type of crime, be it drugs or whatever, not 
that this individual was a subject of the investigation.”

2.34  Mark Thomson, a partner at the media law firm Atkins Thomson, provided an example of the 
serious breaches of the Article 8 rights of the individual who was arrested that could arise as 
a consequence of the media accompanying the police on a raid. He told the Inquiry about one 
of his clients who was arrested after the police arrived at his family home unannounced. The 
police had allowed a film crew to accompany them on the raid and parts of the arrest were 
filmed. It subsequently transpired that the police had made a mistake and Mr Thomson’s 
client was completely innocent of any crime, and he was therefore released on the same 
day with no charges being brought. Unfortunately the BBC broadcast the arrest footage on 
national television implying that Mr Thomson’s client was guilty. A photograph of the client 
was also published in a widely circulated TV programme listing magazine. Mr Thomson’s client 
took legal action against the BBC claiming damages and an injunction for libel and invasion of 
privacy. The BBC later agreed to apologise to Mr Thomson’s client and make a statement in 
open court, paying £50,000 in damages and costs.63

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.35 

In an attempt to mitigate the risk of such an occurrence taking place, the ACPO and MPS 
guidance on taking the media on police operations includes as an annex a sample ‘contract’.64 
This ‘contract’ has been developed in response to “lengthy discussions with broadcasters”.65 
It serves the purpose of reminding officers of their duty to respect the rights of individuals 
under the ECHR. In particular, officers are:66

“… reminded that no material, photographs or film must be published or broadcast 
that would interfere with an individual’s rights, particularly the right to a fair trial.”

The ‘contract’ also details the specific responsibilities  of; the media representative(s); the 
individual force; and, in relation to the entering of private premises, the responsibility of the 
adult householder or lawful keyholder. 

2.36 

In relation to the appropriateness of media participation in police operations and the potential 
impact on the rights of a private individual, Andy Trotter, Chief Constable of British Transport 
Police and Chair of the ACPO Communications Advisory Group (CAG), told the Inquiry that:67

“… a balance [should] be struck between the rights of individuals and the genuine 
public interest in showing that we are dealing rigorously with certain crime types … 
also to encourage the public to come forward if they have further information and to 
discourage people who may be involved in crime.”

Importantly in my view, however, he believed that individuals who have been arrested should 
not be identified by any police force, nor the media, although he recognised that others may 
hold a different perspective. Commissioner Hogan-Howe equally also emphasised this point 
and said that this practice was “… just intolerable for two reasons: one, it’s improper, legally 
– well, I’m not sure it’s illegal but it’s improper. But more importantly, it often is wrong.”68  
Mr  Trotter  said  that  this  situation  often  led  to  what  he  described  as  “[the  media]  play  a 
guessing game with us to try and work out who’s been arrested”.69 

2.37 

In  a  broader  sense,  the  primary  issue  of  concern  is  precisely  this;  that  facilitated  media 
involvement  in  any  police  operation  may  lead  to  the  identification  of  potential  suspects. 
Both Commissioner Hogan-Howe and Mr Trotter stressed during their evidence the potential 
dangers of this taking place. They both referred to the case of Christopher Jefferies, which 
“already  points  out  the  frailties  of  that  particular  position”  in  relation  to  the  standard 
description  of  suspected  individuals  that  are  released  in  formal  police  statements.70  
Mr Trotter also recognised the problems that have existed in a number of regional forces 
across  the  UK  where  suspects  have  been  identified  and  have  risked  facing  “both  physical 
campaigns in the street or on Facebook and things such as that.”71 

2.38  Commissioner Hogan-Howe used as an illustrative example the case of Rhys Jones, a murder 
inquiry  which  attracted  a  huge  amount  of  press  interest,  particularly  at  a  local  level.  The

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGsuspected offender had been “named on the wall … in the area in which Reece Jones [sic] was 
murdered.” The information therefore became public knowledge. Despite the fact that “… 
everybody in the area thought they knew they did it [the person named], and we thought we 
did too …”72, Commissioner Hogan-Howe stressed that:73

“… there’s no way we confirmed that to the press, nor should we ever have done that. 
We worked our way methodically, over a year, to prove the case against him and the 
people who had helped him after the event.”

He offered the general view that there should be “… no background briefing on suspects. 
There should be no comment about suspects …”74 He made the point that on occasions a force 
may announce the arrest of a suspect in very general terms but considered that there was no 
benefit, nor any reason to say, for example, “And this man, this woman, are people who we 
are interested in and we are now pursuing a case against them …”75 His one exception to this 
rule was in cases where a suspect might be considered a risk to the general public and were 
actively  evading  police  authorities.  However,  Commissioner  Hogan-Howe  recognised  that 
this was still “a very hard test, because there is a risk therefore to the court process later”.76 
He explained that:77

“If you’ve named someone and shared a photograph, it can limit some of the evidential 
lines that may be available later. So it’s always a case that – that type of revelation is 
always made after a careful discussion, particularly with CPS and our own lawyers, to 
make sure that we can substantiate the dangerous and, number two, is there is [sic] 
reason to alert the public at large so we can locate them before they hurt someone 
else? That would be the only time I could see [it happening].”

2.39 

I  would  endorse  the  general  views  of  Commissioner  Hogan-Howe  and  Mr  Trotter  on  this 
issue. Police forces must weigh very carefully the public interest considerations of taking the 
media on police operations against the Article 8 and Article 6 rights of the individuals who 
are the subject of such an operation. Forces must also have directly in mind any potential 
consequential impact on the victims in such cases. More generally, I think that the current 
guidance in this area needs to be strengthened. For example, I think that it should be made 
abundantly clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, 
where there may be an immediate risk to the public), the names or identifying details of 
those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press nor the 
public. 

Off-the-record briefing

2.40  When  opening  this  module,  Mr  Jay  identified  the  “giving  and  receiving  of  off-the-record 
briefings” as one of the potential manifestations of an overly close relationship between the 
police and the press.78 The principal risks are two-fold, namely the obvious lack of transparency 
of such interaction, and the potential expectation of future favours from both sides.79

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGDefinition

2.41  One of the potential issues with ‘off-the-record’ briefings or conversations is the lack of clarity 
around the meaning of this term. It has been apparent from the evidence that the term is often 
misunderstood and has been used interchangeably with other terms such as non-attributable 
when  police  officers  or  police  staff  and  journalists  establish  the  basis  for  a  conversation. 
HMIC, within their report ‘Without fear or favour – a review of police relationships’, found 
that “there is inconsistency across the Police Service in the use of ‘off-the-record briefings’.”80 
Sir Denis O’Connor, former Chief Inspector of the Constabulary, elaborated on this point and 
said:  “…  my  understanding  is  that  across  the  country,  some  people  have  a  form  in  which 
they will do non-reportable briefings, some are much less formalised, some will do it more 
frequently than others. Some are less concerned about exclusiveness in these things in terms 
of how many people they speak to …”81 Her Majesty’s Inspector of the Constabulary, Roger 
Baker, in describing this problem said: “… clarity of definition, I think, is important for the 
future of what “off the record” means and what it doesn’t mean.”82 

2.42 

In his evidence, Dick Fedorcio, former Director of Public Affairs for the MPS, reinforced HMIC’s 
findings in this area. He made the point that he had “always encouraged the provision of as 
much information “on the record” as possible in the interests of openness and transparency 
but also because of the dangers that can arise through differing interpretations among police 
officers,  press  officers  and  journalists  as  to  the  use  and  meaning  of  ‘off  the  record’.”83  He 
expanded on the confusion surrounding the use of this terminology, and said:84 

“I think it’s a serious problem. It’s never, in my view, been solved in my time in dealing 
with it with the Metropolitan Police and the journalists that we work with. It became 
a bit of a standing joke at meetings with the Crime Reporters Association that every 
time someone said, “Can we go off the record?” there would then have to be a debate 
as to what we meant, so that we would reach a common understanding on that day 
on that issue at that time as to what we meant. Did we mean that we were going 
to  tell  you  something  that  you  could  not  use  at  all,  or  were  we  going  to  tell  you 
something that you could use but not attribute to us?” 

2.43 

It is clearly that this issue that is not limited to the larger metropolitan force areas. Craig 
Mackey, former Chief Constable of the Cumbria Constabulary and now Deputy Commissioner 
of the MPS, for example, in respect of Cumbria Constabulary’s interaction with the press, 
stated  that  “there  are  no  off  the  record  discussions  except  for  background  information 
ahead of complex court cases.”85 However, Anne Pickles, the Associate Editor for Cumbrian 
Newspapers, said that on occasions off-the-record briefings and communications do occur.86 
Gillian Shearer, head of marketing and communications for Cumbria Constabulary, explained

792

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGthat this apparent contradiction was due to a “… blur around the terminology.”87 Mr Mackey 
agreed, and said: 88

“I think it comes to this heart of what is “off the record”. It’s different with different parts 
of the media, and different media outlets will give you a different interpretation of 
what that means. I prefer and always work with ‘attributable’ and ‘non-attributable’. 
Everything we said to the media is absolutely attributable to an individual who said 
it …”

2.44  Similarly,  from  the  perspective  of  a  journalist,  Nick  Davies  (a  freelance  who  has  worked 
under a part-time contract for Guardian News and Media Limited since 1989) said “… there’s 
confusion  about  it.  American  journalists  and  a  few  British  use  that  expression  to  describe 
material which is being provided on the condition that it isn’t used at all, but I use it in the 
way that most British reporters use it, which is to say that the information is off the record if 
it’s been given to me for use but not to be attributed to the source …”89 Paul Peachey, crime 
correspondent for The Independent, agreed: 90

“It’s a term that needs clarifying. I work for an American organisation and they have 
very different views about what “off the record” means. “Off the record” can mean 
that that detail cannot be used for writing, so … shall we say “off the record” means 
it’s just for your knowledge and you don’t use it for an article or it’s often confused 
with  background,  which  can  be  used  in  an  article.  So  most  situations  it  has  to  be 
defined, so often, you know, it can mean purely for my own background use, it could 
mean for something to be printed unattributably … I have a definition in my mind, 
but I think it’s a term that is often confused by other people, particularly not in the 
profession.” 

2.45  A number of possible definitions or categories of ‘off-the-record’ contact emerged during the 
course of this part of the Inquiry. The first was that provided by Mr Davies: the information is 
provided for use but not to be attributed to the source. Sandra Laville, crime correspondent 
for The Guardian, in this context suggested that “sometimes the police might give off the 
record  guidance  on  something  in  order  to  make  sure  that  a  mistake  is  not  made  in  the 
reporting of a subject, or to correct inaccuracies.”91 Mark Hughes, crime correspondent for 
the Daily Telegraph, provided similar evidence, citing in particular the considerable amount 
of misinformation that was corrected by the police through off-the-record briefings in the 
Sian O’Callaghan murder investigation.92

2.46  A second category of off-the-record briefings were described by Mrs Filkin, who provided 
the example of a formal briefing where it has been agreed by both sides that it will be off-
the-record and that “… the journalists won’t print anything at the moment because it might

793

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGdo harm or jeopardise some investigation.”93 The understanding in this scenario is that the 
police intelligence can be published at some point in the future. Jeff Edwards, President of 
the  Crime  Reporters  Association,  provided  the  example  of  a  terrorist  incident  or  a  major 
crime inquiry where “accidental reporting might seriously damage a criminal investigation.”94

2.47  The third category of off-the-record briefing relates to material that cannot ever be published, 
but  is  provided  to  give  the  press  important  background  information  to  an  event  or  story. 
Again, this situation might often arise in the context of a counter-terrorism investigation. Ms 
Laville provided the example of the “regular off the record briefings from the Met Police at 
the height of the terrorist threat in London 2005.”95 In respect of the briefings she said that 
“most of these were unreportable, but they did provide background on what the police were 
facing.”96 

2.48  Given the variation in terminology and the associated definitions used, the current ‘Interim 
ACPO Guidance for Relationships with the Media’ seeks to define the generally used police 
and media speaking terms as follows: 97

“On the record – means that a journalist can report, quote and name their source. 
Where  possible,  all  conversations  should  be  on  this  basis  and  it  should  always  be 
assumed that a conversation is on the record unless expressly agreed otherwise in 
advance.

Background/guidance – means that information provided can be reported without 
it  being  attributed  to  a  source,  whether  named  or  not.  This  is  sometimes  used  to 
provide further context around an on the record statement.

Off  the  record  –  means  that  use  of  information  provided  is  restricted  altogether. 
Occasionally there may be a legitimate reason for an off the record conversation or 
briefing to take place, such as where news reporting may have an impact on a current 
investigation or as a means of preventing inaccuracies or misunderstanding.” 

2.49 

It is very difficult to draw any firm conclusions as to how widespread or common each of these 
forms of contact is in practice; it is also the case that on occasions there is some overlap between 
them. The evidence of the journalists, for example varied considerably. Jon Ungoed-Thomas, 
chief  reporter  at  The  Sunday  Times,  said  that  “I  have  been  offered  off-the-record  briefings 
probably fewer than 10 times in the last five years, all of which have involved a face-to-face 
meeting.”98 Michael Sullivan, crime editor of The Sun, on the other hand, suggested that he had 
“attended a substantial number of ‘off record’ briefings over the years, though they are much 
less frequent nowadays.”99 Similarly, Thomas Pettifor, crime correspondent at the Daily Mirror, 
in describing the frequency of his off-the-record conversations with the MPS said:100

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“… “off the record” is a slightly vague term that I don’t really like using, but it would 
be a non-attributable conversation, just to give me context on the story. So it could 
be  a  couple  of  –  three  times  a  week,  maybe,  that  I  would  have  non-attributable 
conversations with officers.”

2.50  Given the apparently nebulous nature of the term ‘off-the-record’, it is not unsurprising that 
there have been problems arising through its application. Mrs Filkin summarised the issue in 
her evidence to the Inquiry:101 

“… In relation to on or off the record, my key recommendation to people would be: talk 
to the journalist and find out what this actually means before you start. To exercise 
some judgment about it. Many journalists are absolutely proper about it, tell you exactly 
what they will do or won’t do with an off-the-record briefing, and if you explain to them 
that you can give them information but they can’t use it at the moment, will respect 
that. There’s no issue. Some won’t. Some are untrustworthy, and like any other walk of 
life, one has to weigh up people very carefully in terms of what they’re saying …” 

Advantages

2.51  Despite the confusion that exists in relation to the terminology (with the associated uncertainty 
in relation to the potential downstream use of the information being provided), many of the 
witnesses argued that the provision of ‘off-the-record’ briefings served a number of valuable 
and important purposes.

2.52  Two  senior  and  experienced  journalists  described  the  provision  of  information  through 
‘off-the-record’  briefing  as  vital.  Stephen  Wright,  Associate  News  Editor  at  the  Daily  Mail, 
suggested that “there must be scope for off-the-record contact with the police.”102 He said 
that it was a “vital way in which people within the force can voice their concerns and expose 
corruption, malpractice and abuses of power.”103 John Twomey, crime reporter for the Daily 
Express and Chairman of the CRA, said that: 104

“off the record conversations are a vital way the media gets information. A good deal 
of what is disclosed during non-attributable briefings could and, perhaps, should be 
given on-the-record. But there are often compelling reasons why briefings are given 
off-the-record.” 

2.53  Mr Davies argued that speaking off-the-record can promote openness and transparency. He 

explained: 105

“…  I  think  the  immediate  fear  that  police  officers  have  when  they  sit  down  with 
a  journalist  is  that  they’re  going  to  get  misquoted,  and  if  you  can  say,  “This  is 
unattributable, i.e. you are not going to get quoted at all”, then that fear is removed. 
That  I  would  say  is  the  primary  reason  why  it  happens.  It  really  isn’t  sinister.  It’s 
mainstream, normal, unsurprising, over and over again.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGMr Davies went on to say that it would be a “… mistake to say off the record is the source of 
the problem. Off the record isn’t sinister. Off the record helps people to tell the truth”.106 He 
also warned against any over reaction to recent events which understandably have called into 
question the very notion of ‘off-the-record’ contact. As to this, he said:107

“… what’s wrong is to try and close down all off-the-record briefings or all unauthorised 
access. It’s like saying, “Because I got food poisoning last night, I’ve never going to 
eat again.” It’s too destructive …” 

2.54  A  number  of  other  journalists  supported  this  viewpoint.  Jerry  Lawton,  Chief  Crime 
Correspondent  of  the  Daily  Star,  said  that  “all  good  [police]  forces  offer  off-the-record 
briefings. In my opinion they are an essential tool for accurate crime reporting.”108 By way of 
illustration he provided the example of the ‘off-the-record’ briefing delivered by the police 
during the Raoul Moat investigation:109

“In the Raoul Moat case police took the world’s media into their trust after recovering 
a taped threat from the still-at-large gunman that he would execute a member of 
the public for every perceived untruth about his family he read/heard in the media. 
At an off-the-record briefing officers in the case explained the situation and asked 
newspapers/TV  and  radio  to  avoid  publishing/broadcasting  information  about 
Moat’s family or any details about the threat itself. On my part a double page spread 
we were planning to run the next day was pulled – without protest or question – the 
moment  I told  the news  desk. Everyone  adhered to  the news blackout.  Moat  was 
caught without further bloodshed.”

2.55  A number of journalists also commented on the general utility of ‘off-the-record’ briefings. 

Mr Ungoed-Thomas explained:110 

“The value of such [off-the-record] briefings is that it allows officers to speak freely 
and provide useful intelligence, without being nervous that anything they say might 
be published. The information helps provide useful background and credibility to an 
article, and helps the reporter understand the intelligence on which police officers 
may base their assertions.” 

2.56  Sean O’Neill, crime editor of The Times, suggested that he had received formal ‘off-the-record’ 
briefings because “the officer giving them has been in a sensitive role (for example counter-
terrorism, organised crime) and reluctant to be named/quoted/identified for personal security 
reasons.”111 Mr Sullivan also provided an illustration of the type of material that might be 
provided through an ‘off-the-record’ briefing:112

“… if there is a murder and police are looking for a specific suspect known to the 
victim, then it is useful to know that while reporting on the crime to avoid causing 
unnecessary fear to readers by giving them a misleading impression the murder was

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGa random act which has put them at risk. Information like that might be given off 
the record and be accompanied with requests not to publish any names or pictures 
of anyone of interest to the police whom we have obtained information about from 
neighbours, friends or relatives.” 

2.57  Mr Peachey similarly recognised the benefits of ‘off-the-record’ briefing for the purposes of 
providing context and to help to prevent inaccurate reporting.113 He also suggested that ‘off-
the-record’ communication was:114

“… part of the relationship of trust that you have to build. I mean, that’s part of the 
job that I do, is to try to build trust between myself and officers in the organisations. 
To enable a free flow of information in the knowledge that some things will be told to 
you not for use, but so that they could effectively allow you to write your story.” 

Mr Peachey did, however, also acknowledge that there were risks associated with the practice. 
He said:115

“…  if  something’s  been  given  off  the  record,  then  it’s  not  attributed  to  anybody 
particular, so they are perhaps handing over that information without the responsibility 
that it entails, so, you know, so such information would always have to be checked 
perhaps more thoroughly than information that would be given by a named source 
and in the name of a particular organisation.” 

2.58  Dr Rob Mawby, from the Department of Criminology at the University of Leicester, suggested 
that  from  a  policing  perspective,  ‘off-the-record’  briefings  had  been  identified  as  being 
important as long ago as the 1930s, “when Lord Trenchard (Met. Commissioner from 1931 
to 1935) took to explaining to Fleet Street editors the reasons for his reforms before making 
them  public.”116  He  made  the  point  that  subsequently,  “off-the-record  conversations  and 
briefings have become part of the currency of police-media relations.”117 

2.59  Peter Clarke, formerly an Assistant Commissioner in the MPS, provided an illustrative example 
of the potential benefits to the police, and more importantly to the public, of ‘off-the-record’ 
briefing. He told the Inquiry that:118

“in the period before the attacks on London in July 2005, and before any of the major 
terrorist trials reached the courts, I felt that there was an overwhelming public interest 
in the media being made aware of the true nature of the terrorist threat to the UK. 
During off the record briefings, I informed reporters what was in the pipeline in terms 
of  trials,  without  prejudicing  either  current  intelligence  or  the  trial  process  …  The 
objective was to offer responsible reporters an alternative view to the criticism that 
was coming from some quarters that the police were unfairly targeting the Muslim 
communities,  using  oppressive  methods  and  arresting  large  numbers  of  innocent 
people  who  were  then  being  released  without  charge  …  The  objective  was  not  to 
enhance the reputation of the police, but to try to maintain the confidence of the 
Muslim communities through what was a deeply unsettling time for them.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.60  Similarly, Catherine Llewellyn, the assistant director of corporate communications for South 
Wales  Police,  considered  ‘off-the-record’  communications  to  be  a  valuable  tool.119  She 
explained that ‘off-the-record’ briefings and communications happened “quite regularly”120, 
and that the information provided was not for publication and was intended to: 121

“… either provide important background information, i.e. to contextualise an issue, 
or information that’s given to correct an inaccuracy, but importantly it is information 
that is not intended for print.” 

2.61  Peter Vaughan, Chief Constable of South Wales Police, provided such an example:122

“… [T]here was [a] counter terrorism operation within the Cardiff area and a number 
of individuals were arrested and it quickly got into the media that a local shopping 
outlet was the target of their ambition and we had phone calls from the media to 
say, “We’ve heard that this was the target, this particular area was the target, is that 
right?” And we were able to say to the media outlets, because of the relationships 
that we’d developed with them of trust, that it wasn’t that outlet, not tell them where 
it was, that the target of the activity was, but fairly and squarely saying that the 
communities of South Wales have nothing to worry about, go into that particular 
area, so it became a very useful method then of managing what could quickly have 
escalated out of control …”

2.62  The potential value of ‘off-the-record’ briefings was not recognised just by the Police Service. 
Lord Macdonald QC, former Director of Public Prosecutions, explained that as part of a wider 
programme of public engagement (with the aim of increasing public confidence in the Crown 
Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Criminal Justice System more generally), he had:123

“…  instituted  a  system  of  embargoed  briefings  for  the  media  ahead  of  significant 
criminal trials, which would often include off-the-record material. These were very 
well  attended  by  representatives  of  the  press  and  broadcasters  and  there  was  no 
occasion on which the terms of the briefings were breached. These briefings were 
designed to assist the media by placing in context the allegations and by explaining 
the background to the proceedings.”

Risks in principle

2.63  Despite  the  potential  value  of  ‘off-the-record’  media  contact,  there  are  clearly  inherent 
risks engaged by the practice. These risks have not gone unnoticed. The recently issued and 
revised ‘Interim ACPO Guidance for Relationships with the Media’, for example, stresses that 
“It is important to be aware that speaking terms [including use of the term ‘off-the-record’] 
are sometimes misunderstood or used interchangeably. For this reason it is always important 
to clarify how they will apply before exchanging information.”124

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.64  A succession of Media Policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued by the MPS 
also appear to have recognised this point. Special Notice 19-00 (A new policy for relations 
with the media) stated that: 125

“…  when  confidence  and  trust  is  established  there  may  be  occasions  when  senior 
officers will feel able to talk to reporters on an ‘off the record’ basis – dealing with 
matters not for public disclosure, explaining reasons for maintaining confidentiality 
and specifying what might be published.” 

However, the notice also warns that: 126

“… it will be for OCU commanders and heads of branches to decide at what levels 
within their own areas of responsibility such discretion may be exercised. If there is 
any doubt about this, advice must be sought from the DPA or enquiries referred direct 
to them.” 

2.65  This advice was further developed in the MPS Media SOP 26/2006, which was issued on 5 
July 2006. The warnings given in relation to ‘off-the-record’ communications are similar in 
most respects to the current interim ACPO media guidance. It stated:127 

“Misunderstandings can sometimes occur about what ‘off-the-record’ means. Some 
journalists interpret it as being completely non-reportable, whilst others believe that 
they can report what is said but not attribute it to the individual who said it. It is 
therefore advisable that before giving guidance of this sort, the officer/police staff 
members clarifies the basis on which it is being provided.” 

2.66  The  updated  MPS  Media  SOP  issued  in  June  2008  contained  similar  warnings,  but  also 
emphasised that “Police officers or members of police staff must not express views or give off 
the record guidance on cases/issues that they are not involved in as this could compromise 
an operation or investigation. Such action could lead to disciplinary action being taken.”128 
The policy also makes the point that “it is good practice to keep a written note of any off the 
record briefings given.”129 

Risks in practice

2.67  Given  the  risks  involved  in  the  practice  of  ‘off-the-record’  briefings  or  communications,  a 
number of witnesses argued that this type of police and press interaction should cease, or 
at the very least be heavily modified. In very general terms, Lord Condon said that “off-the-
record briefings are never something which I’ve felt comfortable with”.130 Lord Stevens agreed, 
and said, “I, like Paul Condon, have a problem about off-the-record briefing, especially if police 
officers are giving their opinion rather than what the evidence is, and it’s very dangerous 
territory, I think, in my view.”131

799

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.68  As detailed above, Cumbria Constabulary have a policy of not giving ‘off-the-record’ briefings 

to the media save in exceptional circumstances.132 As to this, Ms Shearer said:133 

“… I think I would expect the justification to be incredibly significant and the sort of 
times that I would perceive that to be is around counter-terrorism and at that sort of 
level. That’s the time when you should be considering off the record. Everything else 
should be on the record, if you are going to say it.” 

2.69  Anne  Campbell,  chair  of  the  Association  of  Police  Communicators  (APCOM)  and  head  of 
corporate  communications  for  Norfolk  and  Suffolk  constabularies,  found  the  term  itself 
unhelpful. She said:134

“I  prefer  not  to  use  the  term  “off  the  record”.  Again,  I  think  the  connotation  is 
unhelpful. I think there are occasions where it’s useful to have what I would call a 
background  briefing,  to  give  the  context  to  help  a  journalist  understand  more  of 
the story in order to make a decision one way or the other. I think “off the record”, 
it’s not a phrase that I personally use and it’s not a phrase that you would hear in 
the department used by colleagues. As I say, you do occasionally do a background 
briefing, but those background briefings would also then be uploaded to our Spotlight 
system. So basically there is a record of everything, and it will be very clearly stated 
whether it’s for publication or not for publication but for guidance.”

2.70  Despite some of the misgivings in relation to ‘off-the-record’ contact, it is difficult to quantify 
the extent to which the practice actually gives rise to the problems identified in the above 
sections.  Mr  Sullivan,  for  example,  could  only  provide  one  example  where  a  confidential 
briefing had been provided by the police and a trust had been broken by a journalist. He 
said:135

“There  was  one  occasion  …  I  hadn’t  long  been  a  crime  reporter,  but  there  was  a 
briefing given by – actually it was the head of the counter-terrorism unit, or anti-
terrorist squad, as they were in those days, and I can’t remember or recall the actual 
details  of  the  briefing,  I’m  not  even  sure  I  was  present,  actually,  but  there  was  a 
reporter from one newspaper who hadn’t long been a member, who went back to 
his office, presumably told his news desk what he’d heard, and was then required to 
write the story. This caused a lot of problems, as you can probably imagine … and this 
particular reporter was excluded from the CRA and we obviously offered our sincerest 
apologies to the Metropolitan Police and particularly the senior officer who gave that 
briefing. That’s the only occasion … I can recall.”

2.71  This apparent reluctance to break the trust that exists between police officer and journalist 
where  information  is  being  provided  confidentially  corresponds  with  the  evidence  of  Dr 
Mawby, who recalled:136

“A number of the crime reporters I interviewed talked about how such communications 
[i.e. ‘off-the-record] were important in keeping up-to-date and informed, as well as

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGforming part of their ongoing relationships with key sources. For example, a crime 
reporter with 40 years experience summed up the benefits thus, ‘I like to deal with 
detectives. Most of the information is off-record and if I used it, that would be it – 
finished’.”

2.72  Similarly, and in respect of the potential lack of clarity that exists about what the speaking 
term  ‘off-the-record’  actually  means,  Justin  Penrose,  crime  correspondent  at  the  Sunday 
Mirror, commented that “I have received off-the-record information, but only recall this being 
proactively offered by the police to reporters as a group. In my experience there are three 
levels of information: reportable, ‘off-the-record’ (where information can be reported but not 
associated with anyone), and non-reportable. The police are very clear in briefings where the 
information that they are giving sits in terms of these levels.”137 

2.73 

It is telling in my view, that even those informed witnesses that viewed the concept or practice 
of ‘off-the-record’ communications with a degree of scepticism conceded that it could be a 
valuable policing tool in certain circumstances. Mr Baker, for example, said that:138

“… I’m not a huge fan of what people term “off the record”, although they do mean 
different things by it, I’ve found, but there is a place for it. If that is in extremis, if life is 
going to be endangered … if an inquiry is going to be prejudiced, then there is a place 
for it, but it should be limited, in my view.” 

He expanded on this point and said:139

“There will be circumstances at the top end of the business where lives are at threat, 
there’s a national security issue or an inquiry is about to be completely scuppered by 
certain behaviour, then that would be appropriate to have a conversation that was 
not yet at that moment to be published. I think there is a difference. I think a more 
broad-brush approach, where people are making up their own rules and definitions 
of what this looks like, for the best intentions, is what I’ve found is a major gap … i.e. 
there’s no clarity about the rules, the policies are very different, albeit well intended, 
and so that leaves lots of staff with no where to go, in my view.”

2.74  Mrs Filkin also agreed that there was value for the Police Service in the limited and responsible 

use of ‘off-the-record’ communications. She said:140 

“… I have no doubt that the police will have to occasionally do off-the-record briefing, 
because otherwise they would jeopardise an investigation, and a reporter may have 
got a bit of a story which, if they ran it, would be very harmful, and the only way to 
prevent that being run, in a sensible fashion, would be to give them an off-the-record 
briefing and to tell them that you would inform them as soon as you could when it 
was possible to let that get out onto the public airwaves.” 

2.75 

I certainly agree that in the circumstances outlined above, and for example in the context 
of counter-terrorism operations or other sensitive police investigations, some form of non-
reportable or confidential briefing mechanism should continue to be available as a limited 
tool for the Police Service in their interaction with the media. I am not sure that any specific

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGguidance from me in this area is necessary or would be helpful. I do, however, make some 
observations on the matter which are addressed in Part G Chapter 4 below. 

2.76 

I would endorse the comments both of Mr Baker and Mrs Filkin comments in relation to the 
need for transparency in this area. If the police are simply seeking to correct an inaccuracy 
within a story, for example, then I can see no legitimate reason why that contact should not 
be considered to be ‘on-the-record’. Beyond these matters, the specific recommendations I 
make in this domain are set out in Part G Chapter 4 below. 

Leaks of information

2.77  As Mr Jay identified in his opening to this Module of the Inquiry, leaks of information are 
another potential manifestation of the arguably overly close relationship between the police 
and the media.141 In this section, I will consider this subject and the associated problem of the 
attribution or misattribution by the press of police sources to stories.

2.78 

In setting the context to this issue, Dr Mawby suggested that:142

“… unauthorised disclosures or “leaks” by police personnel to the media will always 
be a threat to a police force’s control of information to a greater or lesser degree 
depending on circumstances. The disgruntled employee or the whistle blower can be 
an important media source. The extent to which leaks are either in the public interest 
(for  example,  bringing  malpractice  to  light)  or  a  problem  (for  example,  putting 
someone in danger) depends on the circumstances of each incident.” 

2.79  The evidence that I have received would suggest that in general terms, the problem of leaks 
to the press has been an enduring issue faced by the Police Service. The actual extent of the 
problem has been a matter of some debate. The former Home Secretary, Jack Straw, said that 
although he had no direct knowledge of this issue, he had nevertheless formed a view during 
a brief period at the Bar during the 1970s that:143

“… in every police station, the local or national papers would have a stringer, who was 
a police officer or member of staff, who they were paying [for information] …” 

2.80  Lord Reid, who held the position of Home Secretary from May 2006 to June 2007, said that he 
had experienced two media related leak incidents that gave rise to concern. In one case, the 
informant had been identified as a former Detective Inspector at the MPS who had retired 
but then subsequently returned to work as a police staff member.144 The individual concerned 
was sentenced to eight months in July 2007 for misconduct in public office.145 The second 
case was in relation to a leak about terrorist and counter-terrorist activity but the source was 
never discovered.146

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.81  Lord Condon explained that during his period as Commissioner of the MPS, leaks to the press 

were a cause for concern “in a general way”.147 He said: 148

“… I think they’re always a concern. Again, you reluctantly don’t accept but you sort of 
grudgingly acknowledge that, in a force of 45,000 men and woman, police and civilian, 
occasionally there may be leaks, for mixed motivation and probably occasionally for 
financial reasons. But, again, during my time I was not aware that it was a significant 
issue beyond the general challenge of dealing with bad police officers.”

2.82  Lord Stevens recalled that he had developed “considerable experience with the problem of 
leaks of confidential information to the media from my experiences in Northern Ireland.”149 
However, to the best of his recollection, during his time as Commissioner of the MPS he was 
“not aware of any specific cases of leaks to the media by individual officers.”150 

2.83  Lord Blair said that during his tenure as Commissioner of the MPS he felt “that there were 
an increasing number of leaks to the media.”151 He suggested that the leaks were emanating 
from the MPS’ management board and the level just below,152 he explained that:153

“… on no occasion did I ever suspect that any of my senior colleagues were passing 
on information for money, but I do believe that on some occasions some were being 
indiscreet as a result of a desire to advance their own views in the public mind or to 
improve their own public profile.” 

The leaks referred to were of a gossipy nature relating to tensions and disharmony within 
the MPS management board at the time, rather than leaks of sensitive information relating 
to police operations or ongoing cases. Lord Blair described the desire to gossip as “a natural 
human habit”, but understandably one that ought to be stopped.154

2.84  Dick Fedorcio, Director of Public Affairs for the MPS during the Commissionership of Lord 
Blair  and  beyond,  confirmed  that  as  a  result  of  “…  concerns  about  the  way  management 
board was behaving in relation to things appearing in the media …”,155 the MPS management 
board itself, in February 2008, issued a bespoke media policy to govern their relations with 
the press. Mr Fedorcio said that there had been “an inappropriate flow of information” from 
a limited but senior cadre of officer within the MPS at the time.156 He explained that there had 
been a frequency to the leaks and that this illicit briefing of the press went on for a “number 
of months.”157 Mr Fedorcio commented:158

“It was very disturbing, and a very difficult time for the organisation and for Sir Ian

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGBlair to lead the organisation when that was going on around him. Would I would say 
is that the people who I suspect are no longer with the organisation.”

2.85  Sir Paul Stephenson, former Commissioner of the MPS, had been Lord Blair’s deputy during 
the period in question.159 Sir Paul said that upon first joining the MPS as Deputy Commissioner 
in 2005 there were:160

“… frequent newspaper stories of disharmony within the MPS senior management. 
I believed it was likely that some of the reporting emanated from a small number of 
self-interested  officers,  who  either  leaked  to  the  media  themselves  or  gossiped  to 
others who did.” 

Accordingly, Sir Paul made it a priority of his Commissionership to ensure that the behaviour 
described did not continue.161 

2.86  Sir Paul explained that given a lack of specific evidence, his preference was not to try and 

identify the senior colleagues referred to above. However, he did go on to say:162

“… I’m referring to what I consider to be a very small number of the management 
board … who, on occasions, either gossiped or leaked about stories from within the 
Met and from within the management board that was deeply unhelpful and actually 
added  to  a  continuing  dialogue  of  disharmony  and  almost  dysfunctionality  within 
the Met at the most senior levels. That was hugely distracting and, in my opinion, 
unprofessional.” 

Sir Paul said that the leaks had been damaging to the organisation because:163 

“… if you’re trying to run a management board with people making contributions and 
having an open, frank discussion where you are trying to engender a team who are 
willing to disagree with each other in trying to get to the best outcome, to have that 
reported as “management board at war” is deeply unhelpful in trying to creating that 
effective team.” 

2.87 

It was for this reason that Sir Paul encouraged the practice of having a press officer present 
where there were meetings between senior MPS officers and members of the media.164 On 
this point he said:165

“… I thought it would be very helpful if matters came through the DPA generally, and 
if  the DPA were present. In that way, it might discourage the gossiping  and what 
might be described on occasions as being a little bit too loose-lipped … ” 

This would certainly appear to me to be a very sensible precaution where the circumstances 
allow.  Sir  Paul  said  that  he  believed  that  the  occurrence  of  leaks  from  senior  officers

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“substantially reduced during the period of my Commissionership.”166 However, this may have 
had more to do with a change of personnel within the senior team at the MPS rather than as 
a result of a specific policy. Sir Paul said:167

“…  there  were  less  newspaper  stories  about  dysfunctionality  in  the  Met  and 
dysfunctionality at senior level … I don’t claim to be the most wonderful Commissioner 
ever  that  managed  to  do  things  that  other  people  didn’t  achieve.  I  think  I  was 
extraordinarily lucky with the people I had on my team, who were hugely professional 
and were not tempted to behave in that way. So I was a very fortunate man in that 
respect …” 

2.88  This  period  in  the  MPS’  history  also  raises  the  definitional  question  of  what  actually 
constitutes a leak. It is not a viewpoint that I would share but some may argue that gossip of 
the type described, however damaging it may be to an organisation, does not constitute a 
leak of unauthorised material in the true sense at all. Catherine Crawford, formerly the Chief 
Executive of the Metropolitan Police Authority, addressed this point when she said:168 

“… my understanding and to some extent my experience, that is a very wide spectrum 
that is covered by the word “leak”. So at one extreme you might have passing on, either 
for money or other motives, classified material which might endanger the security 
of  the  state, which  clearly  is  a  criminal  matter; to  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum, 
where you can be talking possibly about someone – the expression has been used in 
this Inquiry indulging in a little “tittle-tattle”, maybe saying to a journalist, “You may 
think that, I can’t possibly comment”, which is always an indication that there may be 
something more to probe at …” 

2.89  More generally, Sir Paul said that he believed that there was, and perhaps still is:169

“a view held by some in positions of influence to the effect that the majority of police 
officers gossip and leak information to the media. This is simply not the case. However, 
any such perception, wholly untrue though it may be, is damaging.” 

He also made the point that in view of the MPS’ size and the volume of valuable information 
which it holds as an organisation “information misuse and leaks to the media are always a 
risk.”170 However, he considered that set against the number of people the MPS employ, “the 
number of such events was relatively low.”171 Nonetheless, he conceded that the fact that 
leaks occur at all represents a real problem for the Police Service.172 He said:173

“Their effect is potentially much greater than the frequency of their occurrence would 
suggest.  It  is  an  issue  for  all  major  forces across  the world  and  indeed  for  similar 
organisations. This was a problem that I had faced in my career at Merseyside Police, 
where  leaks  to  the  media  by  officers  undermined  the  image  of  the  overwhelming

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGmajority of staff who were honest and professional. I believe the MPS must always 
remain vigilant to the risk and reality of corrupt or irresponsible behaviour by a few.” 

2.90 

In analysing the extent to which this issue has been a problem for the MPS, Sir Paul provided 
the following breakdown:174 

“16  police  officers  and  police  staff  have  been  prosecuted  for  misusing  police 
information over the past decade, of whom 11 were found or pleaded guilty. 29 police 
officers and police staff have been dismissed or asked to resign and 208 disciplined 
for misusing police information over the past decade. I understand that the numbers 
of officers/staff disciplined for misuse of information has remained stable in the past 
three years.” 

It is not clear how many of these cases relate to the unauthorised disclosure of information 
to the media specifically. 

2.91  Peter Clarke, formerly an Assistant Commissioner within the MPS, expressed the view that 
“from my experience of over 30 years, serving in uniform and detective roles across London, 
I think the extent of leaks from the MPS has been greatly exaggerated, although I would not 
suggest for a moment that it is not a problem.”175 Mr Clarke, for example, recalled the police 
investigation in Birmingham into an allegation that a British serviceman had been targeted 
by a terrorist network. On the morning of the arrests it became clear that key details of the 
investigation and the evidence had been leaked. The person or persons responsible for that 
leak never became known; however, and Mr Clarke commented that:176

“… the circle of knowledge across Government was extensive because of some of the 
issues involved in the case. One might think it instructive, to some extent at least, that 
many of the early media reports on the morning of the arrests were coming not from 
crime or security correspondents, but from political correspondents.” 

2.92  Perhaps  of  a  similar  nature  was  the  issue  of  leaks  in  relation  to  the  ‘Cash  for  Honours’ 
investigation.  Lord  O’Donnell,  former  Cabinet  Secretary,  recalled  that  he  asked  Sir  Paul 
Stephenson in 2007 to look into the fact that information in relation to the police investigation 
was frequently finding its way into the public domain.177 He said: 178 

“… It didn’t seem to be in the politician’s interest for this information to have emerged, 
so I simply asked Sir Paul Stephenson: would he kindly look into the issue? Because 
I didn’t believe the leaks were happening at my end. I mean, there may have been 
other leaks happening from my end, but on this specific issue, I wanted his view.” 

2.93  Former MPS Assistant Commissioner John Yates had been in charge of the investigation but 
Lord  O’Donnell  confirmed  that  he  had  not  at  the  time  (or  since)  necessarily  come  to  the 
conclusion that he was responsible for the leaks. He explained: 179

“Well,  he  was  doing  this  investigation,  so  in  a  sense  I  wasn’t  necessarily  saying  it 
was him. I was just saying it was an area that he was in charge of and could … Paul

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGStephenson  look  into  that  area  and  see  –  was  there  someone  in  that  group  who 
possibly was there. But it was quite apparent to me that a number of senior police 
officers had very strong links with the media, and they were very close and, in my 
view, I would say, too close. Their defence of this was that this was necessary, and 
this was true of a number of senior police officers. I happen to think it’s not the right 
way to operate.” 

2.94  Whatever  the  reality  of  the  situation,  this  again  would  appear  to  have  been  an  issue  of 
perception. Lord Mandelson, however, in his evidence, went much further. He said that it 
was  his  “solid  belief”  that  Mr  Yates  had  been  responsible  for  the  leaks  in  question.180  He 
explained:181 

“… All of those close to the investigation were absolutely convinced that Mr Yates 
was  briefing  journalists  throughout  the  investigation,  and  frankly  it  was  common 
knowledge  in  journalistic  circles  that  this  was  happening.  I  remember  a  journalist 
remarking on this to me himself.” 

2.95  That viewpoint does not correspond with the findings of the police review into this matter. 
The review was led by the then Chief Constable of Surrey Police, Bob Quick. Although there 
is  some  debate  about  the  action  taken  following  the  completion  of  the  review,  Mr  Quick 
confirmed in his evidence that he found:182

“… no evidence of leaks, and more than that, I examined … the pre-interview disclosure 
of material during the interview of a number of suspects, and it was clear to me that 
some of the material in the public domain that was being created as leaked material 
may well have been sourced from people who had been the subject of an interview 
and therefore the disclosure of material in preparation for that interview.” 

Specifically in respect of Mr Yates, Mr Quick said:183 

“I certainly could see no evidence through my review of deliberately leaking material, 
and I saw robust and secure processes to handle the material secured through the 
investigation.” 

2.96  The  allegations  were  also  strongly  denied  by  Mr  Yates.184  In  conclusion,  Sir  Paul  said  the 

following:185 

“… any leaks that were happening could be much better explained of coming from 
without that team, and of course it is the case that the most sensitive information in 
that operation never leaked …”

2.97 

I do not think it necessary for the purposes of this Inquiry for me to reach any conclusions on 
this matter. Suffice it to say, there is disagreement as to the actual source of the leaks and the 
matter may never be resolved to the satisfaction of those concerned.

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.98  Bringing matters forward, Mrs Filkin, through her report ‘The Ethical Issues Arising From The 

Relationship Between Police And Media’, reported that:186 

“it is clear both from what appears in the media, and from what I have been told, that 
there is contact – which is neither recorded nor permitted – between the media and 
police officers and staff, at all levels. This results in improper disclosure of information 
which is damaging to the public, the MPS and to the policing of London.” 

In  attempting  to  provide  some  context  to  this  issue,  Mrs  Filkin  said  that  there  was  no 
consistency in relation to which parts of the MPS were said to be more susceptible to leaks, 
making the point that “it’s always somewhere else.”187 She also recorded the “widespread 
view” that a certain amount of leaking is “inevitable”.188 

2.99  As to the potential scale of the problem, Mrs Filkin said:189

“… it was a big enough scale for a lot of people … inside the Met to be worried about 
it, but in terms of numbers, no, I couldn’t say anything solid about that, I don’t think, 
other  than  almost  everybody  I  spoke  to  felt  it  did  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service 
harm, that  it  was  thought, sometimes  wrongly, to  leak.  I  make the point  that  …  I 
saw instances of other people in other organisations leaking information about the 
Metropolitan  Police  Service.  So  that  obviously  happened  too,  but  certainly  people 
within  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service  felt  that  it  did  them  harm  that  that  was  a 
reputation or a perception, however accurate it turned out to be.” 

2.100  The current Commissioner of the MPS, Bernard Hogan-Howe, told the Inquiry that there had 
been “9 separate investigations recorded into police officers leaking material to the media” 
since he took on the role in September 2011.190 He confirmed that of these, five investigations 
were linked to information leaks to national newspapers.191 In parenthesis, it is interesting to 
note at this point that despite accusations in some quarters that there has been a ‘chilling 
effect’ on the relationship between the police and the media as a result of this Inquiry, there 
have still been a number of incidents to cause the MPS some concern.

2.101  This point was reinforced by the evidence of Ed Stearns, the Chief Press Officer for the MPS’ 
Directorate of Media and Communication, who despite reporting that the amount of “informal 
communications”  between  police  officers  and  journalists  had  dwindled  in  recent  months, 
confirmed that there were still occasions when he was concerned about the provenance of 
information appearing in the morning’s press cuttings (accepting, of course, that it does not 
necessarily follow that the information provided to the journalist comes from a police officer 
or member of police staff – an issue that I will deal with in more detail later in this section).192

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.102  Commissioner Hogan-Howe agreed with his predecessors that “within an organisation the 
size of the MPS, information misuse (including leakage) will always be a risk.”193 However, 
he stressed that the organisation worked hard to mitigate that risk by, for example, making 
those who manage employees with access to MPS databases “accountable for audits of that 
usage.”194 He also pointed out that there were systems and processes in place to “identify, 
respond  to  and  detect  leaks  to  the  media.”195  This  includes  a  daily  media  review  meeting 
to assess current media and press articles linked to the MPS with a view to identifying any 
reports  which  appear  to  be  based  on  unofficial  sources.196  Furthermore,  Commissioner 
Hogan-Howe explained that:197

“Those  identified  as  potential  leaks  are  then  allocated  to  the  relevant  DPS 
[Department for Professional Standards] investigation team to assess and investigate 
as appropriate. The MPS is one of the few organisations which has established an 
independent command to deal exclusively with both overt and covert complaints and 
investigations.”

2.103  Cressida Dick, Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations (ACSO) for the MPS, said that “it 
is clear that over the past few years there have been problems with a small number of MPS 
personnel being willing to leak unauthorised and/or operationally damaging information to 
the media.”198 Furthermore, Ms Dick explained that leaks from the MPS to the media had, on 
occasions, undermined investigations and had “damaged individuals and public confidence.”199 
Ms Dick also explained why she was confident in her assertion that this was not an endemic 
problem for the MPS:200

“… there have been a limited number of convictions, and indeed misconduct findings, 
in  relation  to  leaks  …  so  losses  of  information,  for  example,  whether  negligent  or 
just  careless,  when  it’s  official  secrets,  through  to  actually  forming  a  relationship 
with  somebody  and  deliberately  passing  information  to  somebody  –  for  example, 
a  member  of  the  press  –  we  have  had  a  small  number  of  convictions  and  some 
misconduct findings. So that’s why it’s very clear to me. I’ve also twice during the last 
couple of years been in charge, at the management board level, of our professional 
standards area, so I see the sort of intelligence and the investigations that we’re doing, 
and they are very difficult and frequently we don’t know whether the information 
has come from the police or from some other party, but there are sufficient there 
for  me  to  believe,  again,  that  some  of  these  unauthorised  disclosures  have  come 
from the police … I think in relation to that, I am confident that it’s not an endemic 
problem. I spent sort of, in some senses, all my service thinking about issues like this 
and talking to colleagues and talking to colleagues in other forces around the world, 
and I genuinely do not believe that this is a culture or anything other than isolated 
individuals. That’s my view.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.104  An MPS audit analysis revealed that between 1 April 2006 and 31 August 2011, there were:201

“… 38 investigations involving 41 allegations relating to inappropriate relationships 
with the media that resulted in the alleged leakage of police information. Investigation 
into  these  41  allegations  led  to  the  successful  identification  of  the  officer  or  staff 
member  who  was  the  source  of  the  leak  in  13  instances  (32%).  The  remaining 
allegations are shown as unidentified officer or staff member. 

The  outcome  of  the  investigation  into  the  41  allegations  reveals  that  25  (61%) 
resulted in no further action being taken, 11 (27%) are still ongoing investigations 
and management action accounts for the remaining 5 (12%).”

2.105  In relation to the scale of the problem in the Police Service more generally, Roger Baker, one 

of Her Majesty’s Inspectors of the Constabulary, said that:202 

“… we checked … the databases to find out what was being reported, not just within 
the police, but we took the Police Complaints Commission, the various commissioners 
who keep data on the police. So we searched the databases to find out what was the 
scale of the ill that everyone seemed to want to cure. What we find out, over a five 
year period – we went back to April 2006 in the main – we found 314 cases that could 
be classified as leaks to the police. I’m sure there were far more that hadn’t been 
recorded in this way, but 314, which broke down to relationship issues, which had to 
be fairly specific within this, which there were 12 of across England and Wales, and 
302 which were around information disclosure to the media, most of which couldn’t 
be  traced  through  sources.  So  there  could  have  been  a  relationship  but  it  wasn’t 
clear. Beyond that, there’s clearly a lot more going on, is my view, and part of that is 
because this is not the top – or hasn’t been the top of people’s agendas. Your systems 
and processes have not been focused on finding these things out. They’ve had to be 
fairly major issues for them to become recorded at that moment in time.” 

2.106  It was Mr Baker’s assumption, therefore, that the number of leaks recorded by the Police 
Service  (as  detailed  above)  did  not  truly  represent  the  extent  of  the  problem.203  Jane 
Furniss, Chief Executive Officer and Accounting Officer of the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission (IPCC), reported that over a five year period (2006/7 to 2010/2011) there had 
been  5,179  recorded  allegations  relating  to  the  improper  disclosure  of  information  –  this 
represented around 2% of all allegations recorded for that period.204 Ms Furniss confirmed 
that is was not possible to identify through the IPCC’s data whether the improper disclosure 
was made to the media, a private detective, or to another party for example. She explained:205

“… I think it’s important to recognise that it’s quite a wide category … and I don’t 
mean to diminish its importance by describing it this way – it may be a curious police 
officer who’s decided to access the Police National Computer, for example, to find 
out something about a celebrity. It may be someone who’s looking to see whether 
his daughter’s new boyfriend is a suitable young man. It could be a very wide range

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGof receiving information, getting information to which they’re not entitled, through 
to information being sold to organised crime. It covers a very wide range of activity 
under that particular label, and it’s not possible to break down, not without going to 
every force and asking them to do that kind of analysis, to know precisely how many 
fall into those different categories.”

2.107  Mike  Cunningham,  Chief  Constable  of  Staffordshire  Police  and  ACPO  lead  on  Professional 

Standards, said that the most common leak or approach to the press was:206

“… normally from disgruntled members of staff who have a beef about organisational 
issues. The service is going through significant change … and the changes within the 
organisation, some staff feel that they need to vent their anger at the organisation 
through the press …”

This certainly corresponded with the experience of Chris Sims, the Chief Constable of West 
Midlands Police, who said that there had been occasional leaks within his force area “by staff 
disaffected by national developments or local policy.”207 However, Mr Sims did not believe 
that the unauthorised dissemination of information from police officers to journalists was 
generally a problem for his force.208 

2.108  The evidence of other forces outside of the MPS was of a similar nature. I will deal with two 
by way of example. Peter Vaughan, Chief Constable of South Wales Police, said that there 
had been three leak investigations within the past five years.209 He explained that they had 
been:210

“… initiated after information was received to suggest that following the arrest of a 
serving or a former officer’s arrest, certain information was leaked to the media. Two 
of the matters were unsubstantiated after investigation, whilst the third is currently 
under investigation.” 

Mr Vaughan went on to explain that South Wales Police “have a well resourced and dedicated 
Anti Corruption Unit who have high levels of capability and capacity to investigate issues of 
this nature.”211 As a result of this unit, he said that:212

“… In 2011 we had 153 referrals to the anti-corruption unit, which they then used 
technology and other traditional policing methods to determine the correct course 
of action … the local IPCC are complimentary about the way that we try and root out 
any malpractice, any wrongdoing. We try to get on the front foot to make sure we’re 
ahead of it …”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.109  Within Avon and Somerset Constabulary there have been 20 leak investigations undertaken 
by the force’s internal investigation unit in the past five years.213 Colin Port, Chief Constable 
of  Avon  and  Somerset  Constabulary,  said  that  of  the  20  incidents,  14  were  subsequently 
found not to have been a police leak. In relation to the remainder, four resulted in disciplinary 
action, in one case, no offender was traced and one investigation is still ongoing.214 In relation 
to the four instances of disciplinary action, Mr Port explained why the officers concerned had 
not been dismissed:215

“… what concerned me when I looked at the figures was there were four leak inquiries 
which didn’t result in someone leaving the organisation rather sharpish. These were 
domestic-type  leaks  where  people  had  fallen  out  within  the  organisation,  where 
they’d told stories about colleagues or told stories about partners, and so that’s the 
reason, just to reassure the public, that we don’t take leaks lightly at all.” 

Police National Computer (PNC) 

2.110  A specific area of concern for the Police Service is the unauthorised use of the Police National 
Computer (PNC). Karl Wissgott, Head of PNC Services for the National Policing Improvement 
Agency (NPIA), explained that the PNC was established in 1974 and has evolved over time 
to link a number of separate databases. It holds a range of records, including the details of 
individuals who are convicted, cautioned, arrested, wanted or missing; the registered keeper 
of  vehicles;  individuals  with  a  driving  licence  entitlement  or  who  are  disqualified;  certain 
types of stolen and recovered property including animals, firearms, trailers, plant machinery 
and  engines;  it  supports  enquiries  against  the  National  Phone  Register;  and  contains  the 
details of individuals on the National Firearms Certificate Holders register.216

2.111  The PNC is used by all police forces in the United Kingdom and other authorised agencies, for 
example the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA).217 Mr Wissgott reported that it has:218

“… in excess of 250,000 users and in recent years has handled in excess of 169 million 
transactions (a check or update of a record) per annum, giving a daily average of 
just under 463,000 transactions. It makes extensive use of logging all enquiries and 
updates – this functionality facilitates the auditing and police investigations.” 

He  went  on  to  explain  that  a  number  of  methods  were  used  to  try  and  ensure  that  the 
information retained within the PNC was protected and secure, including accreditation, audit 
processes and mandatory training for all PNC users.219

2.112  Individual forces also have their own audit plans which often work in conjunction with their 
Professional  Standards  departments,220  whilst  the  vetting  of  police  officers  and  staff  with

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGaccess to the PNC is a matter for chief officers.221 Mr Wissgott explained that through the 
PNC, police forces were able comprehensively to log all of the transactions carried out on the 
system. He said that these logs “record all user activity on the system to the extent that both 
what was requested and the resulting response to the request by PNC can be interrogated.”222 
Moreover, he said that:223

“the overt logging of transactions not only provides a record of what is being asked and 
the response but also acts as a deterrent to unlawful access because it is available for 
subsequent analysis and is accepted and used in court as part of the evidential record.” 

2.113  Despite the safety measures and audit systems in place, Mr Wissgott accepted that:224

“there  is,  without  doubt,  evidence  that  the  PNC  is  misused  occasionally  and  that 
misuse,  from  time  to  time,  involves  unlawful  disclosure.  It  is  for  that  reason  that 
safeguards  are  in  place  both  at  a  national  and  an  individual  force  level.  It  is  our 
aspiration that the system will never be misused, but that is quite possibly unrealistic. 
We believe that the current security measures are effective and proportionate and 
that,  although  no  unlawful  disclosure  is  acceptable,  I  do  not  think  that  there  is  a 
widespread systemic problem, nor that any particular and specific additional security 
measure would be effective.”

2.114  Commissioner Hogan-Hogan perhaps went further than Mr Wissgott in analysing the historical 

extent of this particular issue. He said that:225

“… over the years it’s been a chronic problem for the Police Service about unauthorised 
leaks of information, sometimes where officers and staff have used it for domestic 
purposes, but unauthorised, and occasionally – fairly rarely, but occasionally – where 
they’ve  been  paid  for  information  that’s  been  passed  on  to  people  who  shouldn’t 
have had it.” 

With reference to a Freedom of Information request reported in the Telegraph in July 2011, 
Commissioner Hogan-Howe confirmed that over 200 officers and support staff in the MPS 
had been disciplined for unlawfully accessing the Police National Computer in the previous 
ten years, 106 of whom had accessed information in the last three years.226 

2.115  However, as I think Commissioner Hogan-Howe fairly pointed out, that must be taken against 
the millions of times that the PNC will have been accessed during the period in question. He 
said:227

“… I would never dismiss the seriousness of it. Each incident is serious … we have 
a  duty  to  protect  information.  So  each  incident  would  be  serious.  But  if  one  was 
to consider over the ten years, each year we’d employ 53,000 people and we turn 
over probably 5,000 to 10,000 people a year, the numbers involved – admittedly, the 
ones we discover – are relatively small in a very big organisation. But each incident 
should be taken seriously. I’m not sure yet it’s a very serious problem organisationally, 
although others may conclude it is.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.116  Against this backdrop, Commissioner Hogan-Howe provided the following view as to what 
additional  safeguards  may  be  needed,  together  with  an  assessment  of  the  MPS’  current 
information assurance and audit systems:228

“… it may always be that there could be more done, but I’m not sure the scale of 
the problem is such that there would be any need at the moment to increase the 
safeguards. They’re fairly rigorous. First of all, there is a password access to computers, 
which means that the user of the computer can be identified fairly quickly. The biggest 
difficulty  often  is  when  there  are  printouts  from  computers,  and  if  they  are  not 
managed properly, then wide access to the printout can lead to a wider dissemination 
than is legally allowed. That is a risk that we have to keep an eye on. The other area 
that is pretty helpful in helping us to monitor this type of problem is that certainly 
in the Met, we have a covert professional standards department. We have an overt 
one, so if a member of the public complains against a police officer, they will overtly 
investigate that, but then we have a covert team, quite a large team, who, if there is a 
suspicion of this type of misconduct, will covertly investigate it, either through the IT 
systems and through any other legal investigative technique that we have available.”

2.117  The Commissioner’s evidence corresponded with that of Ailsa Beaton, Director of Information 
and  Chief  Information  Officer  on  the  MPS’  management  board.  She  also  confirmed  that 
“information leakage is integral to over two thirds of corruption investigations. Information is 
the commodity most valued by those who seek to corrupt MPS staff.”229 Ms Beaton reiterated 
that information leakage and unlawful disclosure was a “key strand of the MPS Professional 
Standards Control Strategy” and that the PNC was subject to “regular audit and additional 
dips sampling by professional standards.”230 However, she did concede that in her view “the 
current proactive monitoring of system audit trails could be improved.”231 

2.118  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the MPS and the Police Service more generally treat this 
issue with sufficient seriousness. However, it is equally clear that there can be no room for 
complacency in this area given that misuse of the PNC continues to be a problem for the 
service as a whole. I set out my recommendation in relation to this issue in Part G Chapter 4 
below.

Leak investigations

2.119  It was common ground that leak investigations are difficult to conduct, and are rarely able 
to  identify  the  person  responsible.  Lord  Stevens,  for  example,  said  that  it  was  “extremely 
difficult” to enquire into leaks and ascertain who is responsible.232 Sir Paul Stephenson agreed 
and said:233 

“Whilst it’s important, on occasions, to mount a leak Inquiry, I have to be honest: on 
many occasions when we did it, you do so with a heavy heart because it’s going to be 
so difficult to come to a successful outcome.”

814

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGSimilarly,  Mrs  Filkin  recorded  that  “investigations  of  leaks  tend  to  be  futile  and  resource-
intensive.”234 

2.120  It is not difficult to understand why this might be the case given that the information leaked 
is often known to a much broader grouping, particularly in a cross criminal justice system 
context. As Assistant Commissioner Dick put it, “very often in the world that I’ve been in, it’s 
quite hard to pinpoint the leak to the Metropolitan Police.”235 

2.121  The difficulty in pursuing investigations of this type was also illustrated by the evidence of 
John Twomey, crime reporter at the Daily Express and the Chairman of the Crime Reporters 
Association,  who  said  that  over  the  years  he  had  been  the  subject  of  a  number  of  leak 
inquiries.236 He explained:237 

“…  I  think  they  must  have  been  fairly  half-hearted.  You  get  to  know  about  them 
maybe after they’d been concluded, and it seems sometimes that they’ve identified 
the wrong people. I’ve never been formally interviewed or directly asked.” 

Mr Twomey was also clear that even if asked by the police to reveal to identity of his source, 
he would have declined to do so given his moral obligations in this regard.238

2.122  Mr Baker suggested that leak investigations can be made more difficult “by the fact that there 
is a sloppiness of rules around what is permissible and what isn’t”.239 HMIC, through its report 
‘Without fear or favour – a review of police relationship, also stressed the need for national 
standards  in  this  area.240  I  would  fully  endorse  that  recommendation  and  I  deal  with  the 
Police Service’s ongoing response elsewhere in this section.

2.123  Despite the difficulties involved, Sir Paul argued that:241 

“… sometimes one would have a leak inquiry even though it might come to nothing 
– and you have to be very careful with the use of public resources – to remind people 
of the leadership determination to do whatever it can to enforce good professional 
standards of probity.” 

For her part, and whilst not meaning to belittle the difficulty in pursuing matters of this sort, 
Mrs Filkin felt that the MPS could do more to improve upon the effectiveness of the process. 
She  argued  for  a  speedier  resolution  procedure,  where  possible,  and  suggested  that  the 
actual process itself could be more transparent.242 In relation to her second point, she said:243

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“[The MPS are] very loath to tell their staff that they’re carrying out some of these 
enquiries and even more loath to tell them what the outcome was. I give an example 
not in relation to a leak but in relation to another matter, in which people across 
the Met had to get their information from the tabloids about what had happened 
to somebody … I’m sure somebody tried to be absolutely proper and not in any way 
undermine an individual more than they were undermined already because they were 
being sacked, but I think it doesn’t help to create a culture that we don’t approve of 
this and we do take it seriously and we do take action on it if you don’t tell people that 
you’re taking action on it.”

2.124  I certainly agree that transparency of process can be an important tool in tackling this issue. 
It is not a panacea for a problem which, in all probability, will never be completely eradicated, 
however, it would strongly signal that it is an organisational priority and as such may help to 
promote increased internal engagement on this issue.

2.125  Commissioner Hogan-Howe argued for proportionality. He observed that:244

“I would never argue for every leak to be investigated. I think you can drive yourself 
barmy, I think, if we did that. It is where the consequences are serious or it might 
display a pattern of behaviour that we want to investigate. It’s those things that are 
of  concern  to  me,  not  …  tittle-tattle  …  that  will  happen  from  time  to  time,  but  it 
is if it starts to damage our reputation in terms of the integrity of how we handle 
confidential information and sometimes secret information, which it is vital we have 
that – for the trust of our partners and of the public that we are able to maintain that 
sort of secrecy.”

2.126  Elsewhere in the Report, I have recommended that it should be mandatory for ACPO rank 
officers to record all contact with the media, and good practice for junior officers and staff 
(for their own protection). I entirely accept that this in itself will not prevent a determined 
individual from leaking. However, as Commissioner Hogan-Howe pointed out:245

“… I think what it does mean is that if we do establish the source of the leak and then 
we ask them did they report that meeting, did they report their account, then there’s 
a starting place for an investigation, both for a monitoring exercise or audit, to say: is 
that an appropriate link? Is that an appropriate sharing of information? It allows us 
to have that conversation. If someone has chosen not to point out the contact, then it 
puts them in position where they have to explain more, and that is the nature of any 
investigation of that type… It’s not conclusive evidence, but it’s a starting point that 
builds an assumption that might be challenged later, but the person who has a duty 
and a policy that says that’s what they should do, they have to explain, presumably, 
why they choose to ignore it.”

Misattribution of leaks

2.127  An additional problem in attempting to quantify the scale of this problem is the phenomenon 
of  what  the  press  often  refer  to  as  a  ‘police  source’.  Sir  Paul  Stephenson  described  the 

244 pp63-64, lines 13-1, Commissioner Hogan-Howe, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/

816

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGmisattribution  of  a  leak  to  a  ‘police  source’  as  being  “one  of  the  most  disappointing  and 
frustrating aspects of public life in London.”246 He explained:247

“… the assumption very often is if a piece of information leaks into the media about 
an investigation or something that is very police specific, it must have come from the 
police, and if it’s the Met, it must have come from the Met. Very often that information 
will be in the hands of many other people. It might be in the hands of the governance 
authority,  the  Metropolitan  Police  Authority  [now  the  Mayor’s  Office  for  Policing 
and Crime]. It might be in the hands of the CPS, the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission – many people. So there’s the potential of leaks from elsewhere, and 
also it did seem to us on occasions that where the description was “police source”, 
it  seemed  more  likely  to  have  come  from  elsewhere,  and  there  did  seem  to  be  a 
great deal more gossiping – and I understand why – in London than anywhere else I 
worked. This was the centre of power, this was where the national media was, there 
was much more interest, the place was much more political – so therefore there was 
a great deal more conversations going on about policing in London outside policing 
than I ever experienced in any other force.” 

2.128  A number of other witnesses provided similar evidence. Mr Clarke said that:248

“… the expression ‘police source’ can mean anything from a serving police officer, a 
member of police staff, a member of the Police Authority, or even someone who has 
been at a meeting where a police officer shared some information.” 

Mr Port made the point that:249 

“… it is also not uncommon for journalists to attribute information to, for example, 
“a  source  close  to  the  investigation”  but  would  never  reveal  to  any  subsequent 
investigation  who  that  source  was,  making  successful  investigation  very  difficult. 
There is no way of proving there was, in fact, any police source.” 

Mr Stearns agreed, and said:250

“… The information to the journalist comes from many, many different areas, and, no, 
I wouldn’t agree that I would always assume that it’s officers, certainly not.”

2.129  From a journalistic perspective, the term ‘police source’ would appear to cover a multitude of 
sins. On occasion it may indeed be used to protect the identity of a police officer or member 
of police staff who has provided unauthorised information to the journalist. However, it is 
appears that the term is also used for a variety of other reasons, including to enhance the 
apparent legitimacy of a story or potentially disguise the lack of a credible source. At other 
times  the  information  provided  may  in  fact  have  been  given  on  a  perfectly  proper  basis 
but is described as being from an unidentified ‘police source’ to add an air of investigative 
journalism.

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.130  This problem was reflected in the evidence of a number of witnesses. Mr Davies explained 
that  ‘police  source’  was  occasionally  used  to  refer  to  information  provided  in  an  ‘off-the-
record’ non-attributable briefing.251 Mr Ungoed-Thomas, the chief reporter at The Sunday 
Times, was clear that he only used the term for police officers,252 whilst others used it much 
more broadly. Sandra Laville, crime correspondent for the Guardian, for example, in defining 
her  usage  of  the  term  ‘police  source’,  said  that  she  viewed  it  as  being  “broadly  anybody 
linked to policing.”253 She confirmed that this might, for example, include the Police Authority 
or IPCC.254 Michael Sullivan, Crime Editor of The Sun, went further when he said, “I mean 
“police source” could be anything, it really could. There is a lack of clarity around that”.255 Lucy 
Panton, former Crime Editor of the News of the World, candidly said that: “Police source is 
used liberally in reporting.”256 

2.131  Mrs Filkin’s evidence also reflected the nature of this problem. She noted that the use of the 
term ‘police source’ tended to imply a leak, but agreed that it may also be used properly to 
indicate that the source is an institution or someone which is different but related, such as 
the MPOC, or may in fact be a mask to try and protect the real provenance of a source.257 She 
made the point that:258

“I was in one other organisation when a person who had a relationship, a proper 
relationship,  towards  policing  gave  information  to  a  journalist,  so  I  saw  that 
happening, and I was in another organisation where a person said they had given 
information in the past and had described themselves as a police source. So I saw 
those sort of things happening …” 

Both  Tim  Godwin,  the  former  Deputy  Commissioner  of  the  MPS,  and  the  Commissioner 
expressed  frustration  at  this  problem,  which  can  often  cause  confusion  when  deciding 
whether to pursue a leak investigation in the first place.259 

2.132  A degree of lack of transparency in this area is inevitable given the often understandable desire 
of the media to protect the identity of their sources. Given the reputational damage that can 
be caused, I can also readily understand the frustration of the Police Service in circumstances 
where a ‘police source’ is quoted but it then transpires that the information came from an 
outside individual. There is a balance here and I would certainly encourage the press to be as 
transparent as possible when using the term ‘source’, so that the general provenance of the 
information is more easily understood. I revert to this issue in Part G Chapter 4 below.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGWhistleblowing 

2.133  True public interest journalism into wrongdoing continues to play a vital role in the democratic 
accountability of public bodies and institutions. This is particularly so in the case of the Police 
Service  given  the  concept  of  policing  by  consent.  It  is  for  this  reason  in  particular  that  a 
framework is needed to  allow for a safe and  transparent relationship  between the police 
and the media which works in the public interest, respects freedom of expression, but also 
respects the integrity of individual police investigations. At the same time, this framework 
must also still allow police officers and police staff the opportunity to report instances of 
wrongdoing, safe in the knowledge that the information provided will be treated in absolute 
confidence and with the seriousness that may be warranted. 

2.134  It is within this context that consideration must be given to where the boundary lies between 
‘non-official communication’ and ‘leaking’. This line is often unclear and it may be that the 
only meaningful distinction is as between information which the organisation concerned is 
content to be released into the public domain and that which it is not. This latter category 
would clearly include and should comprise information which is operationally sensitive or 
otherwise protected from disclosure by law. However, it may also include information which 
is damaging for other reasons, for example, from a reputational standpoint, or because it 
is likely to undermine public confidence in policing. In these cases, some may argue that it 
would be extremely difficult for an organisation to sit in judgment on itself, and weigh up 
the competing public interests objectively. An obvious corollary in such circumstances is that 
the organisation will decide against disclosure where the balance ought to be been struck in 
favour of it.

2.135  It  is  therefore  maintained  by  some  that  in  the  circumstances  outlined  above,  ‘leaking’  or 
‘unauthorised disclosure’ can serve the public interest. Such an example was provided by 
Sean O’Neill, Crime Editor of The Times, in relation to the:260

“… disclosures over the Met’s failures in the John Worboys and Kirk Reid serial rape 
cases; reporters learnt of serious investigative failings in both cases by attending early 
court hearings and put pressure on the Yard which forced it to make public disclosure 
of its errors. Ultimately this led to a fundamental reform of the way rape and serious 
sexual offences are investigated in London.” 

2.136  In relation to information which ordinarily should not be disclosed to a journalist, he explained 

that:261 

“In my experience this has been information about mismanagement, incompetence or 
inappropriate actions by their organisation or senior managers/officers. A few years 
ago I ran a series of stories which were highly critical of the work of the SOCA. At the 
time SOCA was extremely secretive, had no police authority or similar body to which 
it was answerable and had been totally exempted from the Freedom of Information 
Act. Huge efforts were made to try and track down my source who would have been 
dismissed had he/she been discovered. Thankfully they were not traced.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG2.137  Mr O’Neill made the point that “officers often talk to reporters because they have serious 
concerns about the way their force is operating or about failures in investigations which have 
put the public at risk.”262 Commissioner Hogan-Howe recognised this and said:263

“I would never want to stop somebody in the public interest who wants to – in the 
genuine public interest – wants to reveal something that is not getting out another 
way, and in fact there is a statutory defence for that type of sharing of information 
with the press.” 

Chief Superintendent Derek Barnett, President of the Police Superintendents’ Association of 
England and Wales, also accepted that going outside the confidential reporting system might 
be appropriate, but only in “extreme circumstances.”264 

2.138  This leads to the associated debate around the extent to which an individual must exhaust 
internal procedures before disclosing confidential information to the media. On this issue, Lord 
Macdonald QC, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, expressed a cautionary view:265 

“I  disagree  that  there  is  necessarily  an  unshakeable  duty  upon  whistleblowers  to 
exhaust their internal ‘remedies’ before going on to leak. In too many organisations this 
would be a recipe for suppression. The route from whistle blower direct to journalist 
can serve a very strong public interest. Investigative journalism, in particular, depends 
strongly upon the confidence than an informant has that he may pass on information 
to a journalist without necessarily revealing his identity publicly, subject of course to 
any liability he may incur in law. Again, I believe it would be a matter of great regret 
if the Inquiry were to result in strong discouragement or further legal impediment to 
this process.” 

2.139  The evidence of Mrs Filkin lent some additional support to Lord Macdonald’s analysis. She 

said that:266

“… the Metropolitan Police Service has an internal speak-up process [known as ‘Right-
line’], which I think they take seriously – I had looked at it in some detail – and staff 
can report concerns, either personally or indeed anonymously on the telephone to 
that operation and those reports are looked at very carefully. I believe that the current 
Commissioner is looking at all those reports as they come in. So there is a process. 
What quite a lot of staff said to me … is, “Oh, well, I wouldn’t use it because I don’t 
know what they do with it and I don’t trust it”, and so in many instances I would say, 
“Well, wouldn’t it have been the sort of thing you could have brought to the attention 
of your manager?”, and I would get the same reply. Obviously for some people there 
were concerns or fear about their own future if they were in any way regarded – the 
term that they would use to me – as a trouble-maker. But it was clear from looking at 
the system that quite a lot of staff did use it and do use it. But it’s very important, of 
course, that the Metropolitan Police Service do some more to make sure that people 
do use it if they need to and can trust it.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.140  HMIC  made  similar  findings  in  their  report  ‘Without  fear  or  favour  –  a  review  of  police 

relationships’. They recorded that:267

“… all forces have a method of anonymously and confidentially reporting integrity 
issues (whistle blowing), either by telephone or e-mail or both. Feedback from focus 
groups indicated a lack of knowledge or a level of scepticism and distrust regarding 
the anonymity of the systems.”

2.141  With  an  eye  to  the  future,  it  is  clearly  important  that  reporting  systems  are  maintained 
and that individuals are encouraged to use them. I consider that the starting point for any 
police officer or member of police staff when wishing to report an issue of concern should 
be that they first look to their internal procedures. Given the apparent lack of trust in the 
current process, this may in fact argue for a more independently operated system. The logical 
location for such a system may be the IPCC given its statutory oversight role; given the obvious 
organisational ramifications of such a recommendation, I will be suggesting (in Part G Chapter 
4) that serious consideration be given to the IPCC as playing an enhanced role in the potential 
solution to this very important issue. 

The impact on police investigations 

2.142  One of the more obviously damaging aspects of leaks to the media is where they result in 
articles being published that contain confidential details about operational matters. This can 
have a direct impact on criminal investigations and may result, for example, in the provision 
of  confidential  information  to  suspects  regarding  police  operations  and  evidence;  it  can 
undermine  the  confidence  of  victims  and  witnesses;  it  may  damage  the  reputation  and 
infringe the privacy of individuals where the media coverage relates to what are subsequently 
found to be unfounded allegations; and it may also cause unnecessary distress to individuals 
who are pursued by the media because they are the family or friends of a witness or victim. 
A number of egregious examples were provided in evidence. 

2.143  Clive  Driscoll,  a  Detective  Chief  Inspector  in  the  MPS,  recalled  his  experience  as  Senior 
Investigating Officer of Operation Fishpool, the re-opened investigation into the murder of 
Stephen Lawrence.268 He explained  that given the high profile nature and understandable 
sensitivities surrounding the case it had been essential for the police to gain the trust of the 
Lawrence family. He also explained that the issue of the murder and the previous investigation 
had meant that the case “was also very sensitive within the police because of the impact 
the  McPherson  report had  had  on  the  reputation  of  the  MPS  and  the  changes  which  had 
followed.”269 DCI Driscoll said that for these reasons, “we decided to keep information about 
the progress of the investigation very close and disseminate information on a “need to know” 
basis.”270 

2.144  Despite  this,  information  was  leaked  to  the  media  on  more  than  one  occasion.  DCI 
Driscoll  recalled  that  on  18  October  2007  “a  significant  amount  of  information  about  the 
investigation”271 was leaked through an article in the News of the World. He said that despite

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthere  being  “no  permission  for  disclosure  on  the  investigation  we  were  doing  at  all”,  the 
article:272

“… identified that there was a forensic review going on, it identified the fact that we 
had a team working on Stephen’s case, which up until then we’d managed to keep 
fairly quiet … I think they talked about a secret location. It was never that secret, but 
it identified that the Metropolitan Police Service had moved on and were moving on 
within Stephen’s investigation.” 

2.145  DCI Driscoll explained that a second significant leak occurred following a meeting at New 
Scotland Yard on 7 November 2007. The attendees at the meeting were DCI Driscoll himself, 
Assistant  Commissioner  Dick  (who  was  ultimately  responsible  for  the  investigation),  two 
members  of  DCI  Driscoll’s  team,  a  representative  from  the  CPS,  Mrs  Lawrence  and  her 
solicitor and barrister.273 The purpose of the meeting had been to share new evidence with 
Mrs Lawrence and her legal team and provide a general update on progress.274 DCI Driscoll 
recalled that less than two hours after the meeting had finished press enquiries were being 
made. He said:275 

“I received a phone call whilst I was on the train that there was an article that was 
going to be printed the following day which followed the meeting that we’d just had, 
or appeared to follow the meeting we’d just had.” 

2.146  The article itself appeared in the Daily Mail on 8 November 2007, the day after the meeting at 
New Scotland Yard.276 Not only did the article reveal that the confidential meeting had taken 
place, but it also referred to the forensic evidence that was discussed at the meeting.277 DCI 
Driscoll explained that the articles concerned disrupted the investigation and “made my job 
much more difficult”,278 they also negatively impacted on the police’s relationship with the 
Lawrence family.279 He went on to say:280

“At one point it seemed there was almost one story every month, most contained 
publically held or regurgitated information. However, confidential information about 
the forensic evidence was also being published in the media and I considered that to 
be compromising.”

2.147  The  journalist  who  wrote  the  Daily  Mail  article,  Stephen  Wright,  denied  that  the  source 
of  his  information  had  been  a  member  of  the  investigation  team.281  For  the  police’s  part, 
DCI Driscoll did not know the source of the leak but said that could only have come from 
someone within the MPS, the forensics team or the CPS, a number of whom had access to 
the sensitive material.282 He said that he was as “sure as I can be it was not one of my own

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGteam – I trusted them all.”283 Given that some of the details that were published were partly 
incorrect, he offered the view that the person responsible appeared to be “someone sitting 
on the perimeter.”284 DCI Driscoll explained that:285

“…  the  situation  became  so  bad  that  we  eventually  obtained  a  Press  Restriction 
Order at the High Court … to prevent the press reporting about the new evidence in 
Stephen’s murder.”

2.148  On 5 September 2010, DCI Driscoll recalled that he was:286

“…  informed  by  the  MPS  press  office  that  Stephen  Wright  had  got  hold  of  some 
information  which  he  proposed  to  publish,  including  information  about  the 
forthcoming arrests/charges and the fact that we were making an order for reporting 
restrictions … To the best of my recollection he also had details of forensic information. 
All the information was highly confidential and sensitive and was kept very close. I 
do not know how it could have leaked but it was not known to many people and was 
potentially very damaging.” 

DCI Driscoll explained that he asked Mr Wright, through the MPS press office, not to publish 
given  that  it  would  have  had  “quite  a  serious  consequence  on  the  operation  we  were 
planning.”287 Following representations from the MPS, the Daily Mail agreed not to publish 
the article in this instance.288

2.149  Moving matters forward, DCI Driscoll recalled that in the lead up to the trial he was informed 
by a contact that it was “well known in Fleet Street” that a “named senior member of the MPS” 
was briefing outside of official meetings; a later more serious allegation was also added. DCI 
Driscoll said that this concerned “the close relationship between this senior member of the 
MPS and sections of the media. The relationship was rumoured to be corrupt.”289 In relation 
to this specific issue, it is not known whether the senior member of the MPS referred to was 
the source of the leaks in 2007. DCI Driscoll explained that:290

“My  understanding  is  that  an  investigation  did  take  place  and  that  in  fact  that 
information has been passed across to the Independent Police Complaints Commission 
and indeed also to Operation Elveden, so I would respectfully ask that I don’t give 
that name for fear of undermining what could be an ongoing investigation.” 

2.150  Whilst very careful to praise the contribution of Mr Wright and the Daily Mail in the pursuit 
of justice for the Lawrence family, DCI Driscoll offered the following thoughts in conclusion:291

“… I do think it’s essential that the police enjoy the confidence of the public, because 
we are not as effective as we should be without it, and I do believe that maybe lessons

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGcould be learned which would benefit other investigations and other families that 
have tragically lost children … having got the police to be in a position where we 
were conducting an investigation, which I’m delighted to say resulted in some justice 
for  Mr  and  Mrs  Lawrence,  just  to  reflect  on  how  reporting  can  affect  the  family, 
how reporting can affect witnesses and how it can, even though I would be 100 per 
cent sure this was not the intention from the Daily Mail, it can undermine a good 
investigation.”

2.151  Very similar comments could be made in relation to Operation Sumac, a murder inquiry into 
the  killing  of  five  women  in  Ipswich  in  2006.  David  Harrison,  a  crime  investigation  officer 
working with the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) on the murder inquiry, said that 
he was told in a briefing that “a News of the World surveillance team had been deployed” to 
identify the members of the SOCA team and to also establish where the team was based.292 

2.152  Mr Harrison believed that information in relation to SOCA’s involvement in the murder inquiry 
could  only  have  come  from  “someone  close  to  the  investigation  team,  either  the  Suffolk 
murder inquiry or SOCA.”293 Mr Harrison described how the actions of the News of the World 
jeopardised the investigation:294

“…  It  is  historically  known  that  murder  suspects,  before  they  realise  they’re  being 
investigated,  may  return  to  the  scene  of  the  crime.  They  may  try  and  dispose  of 
evidence.  They  may  try  to  move  bodies  or  they  may  even  try  to  commit  further 
offences. If, whilst doing that, they thought they were being followed – they obviously 
wouldn’t know that it was a legitimate police surveillance team or whether it was a 
newspaper, but if they thought they were being followed, they might very well stop 
what they were doing or not do what they’d planned to do … if a surveillance officer 
can see the sort of evidence we were after, if that is not possible, then that weakens 
the prosecution case in the future … The second objective of our surveillance was 
not only to … look for the target to go back to the scene of the crime, but it was also 
… that if he had intended to commit further murders, we were in position to either 
stop him or call resources to stop him. Again, if our surveillance had been weakened 
by having to try and avoid other surveillance teams looking for us, if we’d lost the 
subject, he may have gone and committed further murders because we were dealing 
with something else, we were trying to keep away from other surveillance teams.”

2.153  Detective Chief Inspector Philip Jones of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, the senior 
investigating officer in the Joanna Yeates murder inquiry, gave evidence that the force received 
an “enquiry from the Daily Mail concerning low copy DNA having been found on Joanna’s 
body” during the investigation.295 He explained that the nature of the DNA had been known 
to “a limited number of Avon and Somerset personnel and also to other relevant agencies” 
and therefore a leak was suspected.296 DCI Jones reported that the leak investigation into this 
matter was still ongoing when he gave evidence.297

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG2.154  The description given by DCI Jones of the impact on the police investigation mirrored that of 

DCI Driscoll. He said that:298

 “… the effect of such information appearing in the media had the potential to affect 
the morale of the team and seed distrust between us. It could be very distracting 
from our primary objective requiring us to review our investigation … Crucially, it also 
had the potential to destroy the trust between the police and Joanna’s family if they 
believed that we were not informing them of investigative developments.”

2.155  It is clear from the evidence that media coverage can on occasions have a negative impact on 
police criminal investigations. This impact is exacerbated where the information published 
results from a leak (or an assumed leak), given the internal disruption this can cause to the 
investigating team and the negative effect that it can have on the police’s relationship with 
victims  and  witnesses.  The  points  that  I  have  already  made  in  relation  to  leaks  and  leak 
investigations apply equally here. The above examples also perhaps argue in favour of closer 
(but  transparent)  engagement  between  the  police  and  the  media  in  cases  of  this  sort.  In 
conclusion, Commissioner Hogan-Howe provided an interesting analysis of this point:299

“I think in the cases where the press come to us and say, “We believe X committed 
this crime”, we would always counsel them not to share that information with the 
public. It seems to me that if we are able to put into the discussion – we don’t initiate 
that piece of information as a starting point, but if they come to us with something 
which we know to be true, then we can hardly deny the truth and if they’re right, 
they’re right. But I think we have got a duty to try and persuade them to use that 
information responsibly, which often will mean not publishing it, because that, for 
me, will compromise the criminal justice process. That’s what it’s there for. All they 
can be reporting, often at an early stage of an investigation, is their suspicion. Well, as 
we’ve seen numerous times, suspicions don’t always materialise into convictions. So 
for me, there’s never a reason to start sharing partial information, and on the whole 
I’ve found the press to be pretty good at that. The difficulty comes when you have a 
long-running investigation where the press start to challenge, on behalf of the public, 
whether the investigation is being run in a professional manner and whether or not 
you’re taking all steps you can to secure a conviction. That’s where it can become 
more challenging. But I think provided the press are reassured that it’s a professional 
investigation that’s being well led, well managed, they accept some of the problems 
we sometimes face and hold off.” 

Use of social media

2.156  One  of  the  more  recent  and  potentially  most  effective  tools  at  the  disposal  of  the  Police 
Service for communicating with the media (or perhaps more importantly, directly with the 
public) is through the portal of social media.

2.157  Despite  its  potential  use,  social  media  has  not  found  complete  favour  within  the  Police 
Service. There are also reservations within the media. A number of witnesses regarded its 
advent as being unhelpful to the proper performance of the police and the press within their

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGrespective roles. Colin Port, Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, for example, 
suggested that:300

“… difficulties can arise where people are spending more time tweeting than actually 
policing and we don’t encourage officers per se to tweet. What we have is a number 
of groups of officers who will do it, farm watch or particular watch areas. But we 
don’t encourage officers to tweet … we use Facebook corporately, but Facebook, as 
we know from our own experience, has exposed officers, because of their naivety and 
trust, to potential compromise, so therefore we monitor and give guidance where 
appropriate in respect of that.” 

2.158  Anne  Pickles,  the  acting  editor  of  the  News  and  Star  and  the  Cumbrian  News,  and  Nick 
Griffiths, the crime reporter for the News and Star, agreed that social media was not without 
its problems as a method of communicating with the Police Service.301 Ms Pickles described 
Twitter as a “personal irritant”,302 and said:303

“… since officers have started tweeting, it’s become an obstacle, really, for us. It’s 
almost a full-time job now, monitoring Twitter for police officers’ tweets, and then – 
of course, once they’re out, they’re completely out of control. Nobody’s monitoring 
Twitter. So it’s followed by all sorts of threads and streams coming after an officer’s 
tweet. You get a point where it may be a touch ambiguous. You go to the press office: 
“I’ve just seen a tweet that says blah, blah has happened.” “We have no information 
on that. Try tweeting the officer involved.” From our point of view, it wastes time and 
… it’s just a blurring and a fudging of what was really quite a streamlined way of 
getting information …”

2.159  However, the more widely held view was that social media provided opportunities for the 
Police Service and media alike. The MPS now has its own social media policy.304 The policy sets 
out how the MPS will “support and amplify the MPS corporate communication strategy” and 
“deliver increased direct communication and engagement with Londoners.”305 Commissioner 
Hogan-Howe  explained  that  the  MPS’  general  approach  to  this  issue  had  changed  in  two 
principal respects:306 

“One is that we now have not only a policy but we actually have all the boroughs and 
the specialist departments, who are now being encouraged to use social networking 
rather than discouraged … and the second thing is to actively allow our own staff 
access to the internet. The situation in the past had been … that you could have access 
to the internet as one of the 53,000 if you could show good reason to do it … So both 
in our use of social network and in our access to internet, we’re encouraging our staff 
to use it, not to have to explain why they want to use it.”

The Commissioner acknowledged that there were risks associated with this policy but said 
that:307

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“… no doubt some will let us down and we’ll have to deal with them appropriately, 
but I prefer that problem rather than an organisation that’s a few years behind the 
times.”

2.160  Ed Stearns, chief press officer for the MPS, said that social media offered the MPS an:308 

“… opportunity to reach new audiences … It’s an opportunity for us to get out context 
around issues to the public, and ultimately it’s another way of reaching the public.” 

Mr  Stearns  said  that  the  MPS  had  a  number  of  different  Twitter  accounts,  including  the 
corporate feed @MetPoliceUK which is used as a broadcast tool to provide updates on a range 
of news and other issues, and @MPSInTheSky which is used to highlight the work done by 
the MPS’ police helicopter unit.309 The MPS Twitter feeds are being rolled out to all boroughs 
and will be used “to provide information and crucially to engage with local communities.”310

2.161  Other police forces had a variety of different approaches to the use of social media. South 
Wales Police provides guidance to police officers on the use of social networks which includes 
a “prohibition on divulging any information that may compromise police operations.”311 Peter 
Vaughan, the Chief Constable of South Wales Police, said that officers within the force were 
encouraged to tweet to their communities but to “a limited extent.”312 He explained that the 
force has:313 

“… one Twitter account for each of our basic command units … we have what we 
call ourbobby.com which is a website that each of the policing wards, policing areas, 
electoral wards have their own information on the crime patterns and everything else 
that’s going on.”

2.162  Deputy Commissioner of the MPS, Craig Mackey, also acknowledged that the use of social 
media by the Police Service did not come without its risks.314 However, in respect of its use by 
Cumbria Police (the force for which he was previously responsible), he said:315

“… It would be fair to say if I was doing an assessment of where I am now to where I 
was last year, Cumbria’s probably a bigger user of social media than the Metropolitan 
Police, even given the size of the two organisations. It embraced Twitter, Facebook, 
Bebo,  all  the  social  media  far  earlier  than  most  others,  and  it  also  has  some  real 
practical examples. I’d go back to the 2009 flooding where the intelligence cell actually 
found a lot of people who had been evacuated by Facebook status and followed things 
up in a way that previously we’d have got in a car and gone off and done things. 
It also brings an immediacy to it in terms of last Christmas’ drink drive operation, 
information going straight out on Twitter in terms of what we were doing, where we 
were. It brings an immediacy and an accountability in terms of what’s going on. It’s 
not ideal, the limitation on characteristics, and it’s not without its challenges in terms

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGof people going beyond how they should in terms of their interaction, but as a general 
principle, it’s here to stay and I think we have to embrace it.” 

2.163  Similarly, Jerry Kirkby, the Assistant Chief Constable of Surrey Police, recalled the positive use 
of social media by the force in relation to an armed siege at a bank in June 2010. The use of 
social media allowed for the receipt of information from the public, and allowed the force to 
directly communicate information to the public and the media.316 He said:317

“I think social media is opening up massive opportunities for us for the way we engage 
and  communicate  with  the  public.  I  think  in  this  instance  it  was  complementary, 
predicting what will happen in the future. I think we are seeing greater use of social 
media  by  the  public.  It’s  a  good  means  of  communication.  Twitter  is  an  excellent 
means  of  actually  getting  fast  time  information  out  there,  accurate  information 
quickly. One of the interesting factors in this is not only did we communicate with the 
public; we were also actually communicating with the press on Twitter as well, in so 
much as they were picking up the comments and the feeds that we were putting out.” 

2.164  In relation to West Midlands Police, Chief Inspector Sally Seeley said:318

“It is important to remember that there are officers and police staff within a range 
of  roles  across  the  Force  putting  information  into  the  public  domain  on  a  regular 
basis which is followed by the media. For example, a response officer in Walsall has 
over 3000 followers on Twitter. He regularly ‘tweets’ about his operational activity 
and  writes  blogs  on  subjects  that  interest  him  around  policing,  including  current 
issues such as his experience of the impact of the Stephen Lawrence murder and the 
McPherson Report on policing.

All  officers  are  encouraged  to  follow  Force  social  media  guidance  when  engaging 
and  informing  via  social  media.  This  guidance  directs  them  to  consider  the  Force 
values,  standards  of  professional  behaviour  and  Force  vision  when  engaging.  This 
engagement is monitored by the Corporate Communications Department and is also 
monitored by local supervisors.

The  media  perception  is  that  social  media  accounts  provide  legitimate  and  quick 
access to officers. Whilst engaging freely with the public across social media account, 
officers and staff who use social media accounts are aware that any traditional media 
requests  require  engagement  with  the  Corporate  Communications  Department. 
Our experience is that any approach by traditional media in relation to information 
passed  on  social  media  is  referred  very  quickly  to  the  Corporate  Communications 
Department.” 

2.165  Roger  Baker,  one  of  Her  Majesty’s  Inspectors  of  Constabulary,  offered  the  view  that  “the 
police … have been struggling to keep in front of” the developing use of social media.319 He 
made the point that very few forces had what he would describe as: 320 

“… robust policies around what you can and cannot do on social media sites such as

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGFacebook, Twitter, et cetera.”321 Mr Baker went on to say that “I’m not against any of 
these sites, there are lots of positive aspects from the Police Service communicating 
with the public on these social networking sites to inform the public of issues in their 
areas that they would want legitimately to know about.” 

However, he suggested that controls around its usage were “very blurred” – particularly as 
between what is “public in your professional life” and what should be in “the public domain.”322 

2.166  Andy Trotter, Chief Constable of British Transport Police and Chair of the ACPO Communications 
advisory group, recognised that there was a need for greater clarity in this area.323 However, he 
considered social media to be “an excellent way” of connecting with the public.324 He said:325

“Police  forces  can  communicate  instantly  and  can  receive  feedback  without  the 
filtering process of newspapers, television and radio. Public confidence in the tabloids 
is not always high therefore the police need to continue to develop means of direct 
communication. While there have been instances of poor judgement by police officers 
when putting entries on Facebook such instances should not deter us from embracing 
the  opportunities  presented  by  the  new  world  of  social  media.  Many  forces  have 
made excellent use of new media in high profile murder investigations and during 
public disorder and there is a continuing growth in the use of new platforms.”

2.167  The  Police  Service  has  sought  to  address  these  points  in  part  through  ACPO’s  ‘Interim 
Guidance for Relationships with the Media’. Its section on social networking stipulates that:326

“Forces will have their own social networking policy or guidance but the same rules 
and ethos that apply for dealing with the traditional media also apply to the use of 
social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Social media channels can have benefits 
as a way to start conversations, build communities of interest, engage with the public 
and  provide  information.  Professionally,  Facebook  can  be  useful  to  provide  more 
information than Tweeting alone and photographs/video clips can be added. Police 
Officers and staff should be aware of the danger of material being used out of context.

It is important to note that constraints apply even to the private use of Facebook by 
serving police officers and staff. Personal information that could impact on a police 
employees’ professional reputation or that of their police force should not be shared. 
Additionally, cases or work related issues should not be discussed on private accounts 
via Facebook, Linkedin or any other social media.” 

2.168  This  is  clearly  sensible  advice.  There  is  no  doubt  that,  if  misused,  social  media  can  cause 
difficulties  for  the  police.  This  could  be  through  the  behaviour  of  individual  officers  or 
members of police staff, or may in fact be caused by the actions of the public. Mr Stearns, 
for example, cited the problems caused to the police by the widespread public breach of a 
reporting restrictions order, through the use of social media, in the ‘Baby P’ case.327 However, 
in the main I consider it to be a valuable tool for the police in communicating with the public,

able  to  communicate  to  the  public  directly,  and  not  through  the  conduit  of  the  media.  It 
seems likely that this will be of increasing use to the police and public alike as the role of the 
traditional print media declines. 

3.  Entertainment: an overview

3.1 

3.2 

3.3 

The principles
It is clear that on occasions the MPS, and police forces more generally, has offered hospitality 
to  journalists  and  police  officers  and  police  staff  have  accepted  hospitality  in  return  from 
members of the media, some to a greater degree and on a more regular basis than others. 
The  point  should  be  made  that  the  offer  and  acceptance  of  hospitality  is  not  necessarily 
wrong,  but  must  always  be  treated  with  caution  (as  the  Police  Service  guidance  in  place 
has  made  clear).  There  are  also  bound  to  be  entirely  acceptable  social  and  professional 
relationships  between  police  officers  and  journalists.  However,  where  those  relationships 
create a perception of proximity or impropriety, real reputational damage can be done to the 
individuals concerned and the organisation as a whole. 

This  section  will  first  look  at  the  existing  guidelines  which  establish  the  principles  and 
expectations of police officers and staff; and secondly, whether these principles were applied 
in practice. 

The  Association  of  Chief  Police  Officers  (ACPO)  has  recently  produced  interim  guidelines 
which address the issues identified by both HMIC’s ‘Without Fear or Favour’ report,328 and 
Elizabeth Filkin’s review into the relationship between the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) 
and the media.329 The guidelines include advice on the approach to the acceptance of gifts and 
hospitality.330 These guidelines offer guidance to police officers and staff on the appropriate 
level of relationships, and professional conduct with the media in all forms. They specifically 
offer guidance for the interim, stating that they will be reviewed in light of both this Inquiry 
and the election results of Police and Crime Commissioners in November 2012.331 The ACPO 
interim guidelines include firm guidance which states that:332

“It is essential to the standards of integrity demanded of the police service that police 
officers and staff should recognise and avoid or respond appropriately to potential 
conflicts  of  interest.  These  can  be  understood  as  situations  where  there  may  be 
competing  obligations  or  interest  to  those  who  relate  to  the  legitimate  policing 
purpose for engaging with the media.”

3.4 

Specifically, in relation to the acceptance of hospitality, Section Four of the guidelines advise 
that any instances of personal relationships between a police officer or a member of staff, 
with a member of the media which exists outside of their professional policing role, “should

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGbe disclosed and recorded under a force notifiable associate policy”.333 The guidelines continue 
to advise that “any gift of hospitality must be recorded in accordance with force policy.”334 
The guidance also sets out the duty of police officers and staff to report any practices of, 
or perceptions of corruption, which might include the acceptance of an improper level of 
hospitality.335

3.5 

Reference  was  also  made  to  the  Home  Office  Guidance  on  police  officer  misconduct, 
unsatisfactory  performance  and  attendance  management  procedures  which  was  effective 
from December 2008. In relation to this issue it stated:336

“Police  officers  never  accept  any  gift  or  gratuity  that  could  compromise  their 
impartiality. During the course of their duties police officers may be offered hospitality 
(e.g. refreshments) and this may be acceptable as part of their role. However, police 
officers  always  consider  carefully  the  motivation  of  the  person  offering  a  gift  or 
gratuity of any type and the risk of becoming improperly beholden to a person or 
organisation.” 

3.6 

The Rt Hon Alan Johnson MP, who served as Home Secretary between June 2009 and May 
2012, offered a view as to the sufficiency of this guidance in light of recent events. He said: 
“It seems to me to be sufficient … you don’t need guidance to know how to act properly and 
improperly, so I think that guidance, which I actually thought was much more recent, but it 
seems that it was 2008, is sensible. I never saw it in my period as Home Secretary. I wouldn’t 
have expected to have read it. I would expect people to act with the professionalism that one 
expects both from police and politicians.”337 

3.7 

However, in the absence of any central policy guidelines in relation to the acceptance of gifts 
and  hospitality  (prior  to  the  recent  interim  guidelines  published  by  ACPO),  the  MPS  and, 
indeed individual forces, have generally sought to establish their own policies on this issue. 
The MPS have commented that:338

“Whilst the level of guidance provided by these policies will differ from force to force, 
the MPS felt that given its size and scale of operations, a more precise policy was 
required to provide greater assistance to its staff.”

The overarching principles of the MPS policies and codes of practice are defined by the Nolan 
principles, established by the Nolan Committee’s first report on the Standards in Public Life.339

hospitality policy:340

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“(a) 

 ‘Gifts or offers of hospitality must be refused if there could be any doubt about 
the propriety of accepting them. If a gift or hospitality is accepted, you must be 
able to justify it in terms of benefit to the public service’

(b) 

(c) 

 ‘If the refusal to accept [a gift] would cause embarrassment or offence, the gift 
should be accepted but sent to the Director of Procurement and Commercial 
Services with a covering report.’

 ‘Inexpensive hospitality offered in the normal course of duty, including attendance 
at community functions, consultative meetings, visits to youth clubs and schools 
and  so  on,  may  be  accepted.  It  may  be  appropriate  in  some  cases  to  accept 
the offer of a light working lunch (or very exceptionally a working dinner) but 
more substantial hospitality should normally be declined. If, exceptionally, it is 
considered appropriate to accept more substantial hospitality, authority must 
be given in writing by a senior officer …’

(d) 

 All offers of gifts or hospitality (with certain limited exceptions) must be recorded 
in registers held by each business group within the MPS.”

3.9 

The Special Notice 28/97 introduced the formal registration of gifts and hospitality to the 
MPS.341 The policy outlined the requirement for recording any acceptances or rejection of gifts 
and hospitality in a hospitality register for ‘scrutiny purposes’.342 It set out the responsibility 
of the MPS unit heads to identify vulnerable posts, and to ensure that personal returns were 
submitted  on  an  annual  basis,  including  any  nil  returns.  The  policy  also  echoes  the  ACPO 
interim guidelines, reminding MPS officers and members of staff of their public duty to report 
any suspicion of, or abuse of the acceptance of hospitality to an individual’s advantage.343

3.10  Since August 1997, the MPS have reviewed this policy on a regular basis by means of internal 
audit  by  the  Metropolitan  Police  Authority  (MPA),344  now  reformed  as  the  Mayor’s  Office 
for Policing and Crime (MOPC), most recently conducted in August 2011,345 and resulting in 
a revised policy published in February 2012.346 The review of the existing policy led to the 
following conclusions made by the Corporate Governance Committee (CGC):347

“Gifts  and  hospitality  policy  does  not  reflect  appropriate  professional  and  ethical 
standards and/or does not meet legislative requirements.

Ill defined policy for dealing with offers of gifts or hospitality.

Procedures are not aligned to the approved policy and/or are unclear.

Staff  and  management  are  not  made  aware  of  the  policy  and  procedures  or

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGUnauthorised acceptance of gifts and/or hospitality, lack of transparency, potential 
conflicts of interest, non-compliance, inaccurate supervision and review.” 

3.11  The key principles of the revised policy remain substantially the same, although amendments 
to the level of detail contained in the guidance were introduced, particularly in relation to 
“what constitutes a ‘light working lunch’ or other form of hospitality that can normally be 
accepted”,348  as  well  as  more  clarity  on  the  process  of  auditing  hospitality  records.349  The 
MPS stressed that the revised policy has “made significant changes”,350 although the policy is 
undergoing further review in light of the recommendations of the Filkin Report.351

Other regional forces and constabularies

3.12  Although  there  are  common  elements  between  each  of  the  individual  policies  which 
exist in the regional forces and constabularies, it is evident that there is lack of a common 
framework. The policies generally outline the purpose of the policy, and detail key principles 
and standards which are associated with the policy. There is also a sense of promoting the 
‘common  sense’  approach  regarding  the  acceptance,  declining  and  recording  of  gifts  and 
hospitality. The remainder of the guidance includes: definitions of types of hospitality; the 
boundaries of acceptable behaviour of both officers and staff; as well as the expectations and 
responsibilities of individual police officers within that force, in respect of handling gifts and 
hospitality. 

3.13  The  level  of  detail  included  in  the  definition  of,  and  what  constitutes,  appropriate  or 
inappropriate  hospitality  differ  between  forces  and  constabularies.  Essex  Police  provide  a 
very brief overview of what is considered as hospitality,352 quite similar to West Midlands 
Police.353 Staffordshire Police define the receipt of hospitality as:354 

“The acceptance of free or discounted entertainment, access, service, refreshment or 
alcohol from any person or body outside the police service”

and continues to detail a more comprehensive explanation of the potential types of hospitality 
which officers and staff might encounter.355 The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) also 
follow a similar approach, providing advice and exemplary situations when gifts or gratuities 
may or may not be received.356 Clear responsibilities are set out for individuals, the senior 
management team, District Commanders and Heads of Branches.

3.14  British Transport Police also provide guidance in relation to expectations and full responsibilities 
of: the individual, the line manager, the area and force headquarters department ‘single point 
of contact’ (SPOC), and the Professional Standards Department Intelligence Unit (PSDIU).357

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGThere are exceptions in the acceptance of gratuity, for example, if it is “considered to be of 
crucial benefit to BTP business interested, then this may be accepted provided the specific 
written  authority  of  an  [strategic  command  team]  member  has  been  obtained”.358  Other 
forces, including the West Midlands Police, are less informative in this regard. 

3.15  The principles of public perception and compliance to the Nolan Principles are also frequently 
cited in these policies, quite similar to the MPS, and set expectations of professional conduct 
of police officers and staff in relation to handling the acceptance of gifts and hospitality.359 
The standard operating procedure of British Transport Police includes a requirement to this 
effect, which states that:360 

“All BTP employees should abide by the seven principles of public life in accordance 
with  the  Nolan  Committee  report.  The  seven  principles  are  Selflessness,  Integrity, 
Objectivity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership.”

Hospitality records

3.16  Many of these policies also set a requirement for either (or both) the authorisation of the 
acceptance of a gift or hospitality, and the recording of whether these have been accepted 
or declined. The structure of these policies may also include formats such as a ‘checklist’ of 
correct practices;361 thresholds in relation to the value of gifts which should be declared;362 
as well as reference to document templates for officers and staff to complete the process 
of recording hospitality, which are later released for publication. The processes involved in 
maintaining these records are considered here in brief.

3.17  The MPS requires all police officers and staff in receipt of hospitality or gifts, to declare these 
in a formal record which is published on an annual basis.363 This has been the practice since 
August 1997 and is a formally structured process through which officers and staff are obliged 
to follow.364 The MPS formal guidance specifies a timeframe of five days within which all gifts 
and hospitality (whether accepted or declined), “must be reported to a line manager … and 
entered in the Gifts and Hospitality Register using the Authorisation and Registration form.”365 
This is an electronic register which indexes all entries made by the responsible individual. The 
decision making process in relation to any gifts that are accepted lies with the appropriate 
ACPO level officer (or Director). Gifts that are received are estimated in value, and should the 
amount be greater than £25, the MPS practice is for these gifts to be sold and the proceeds 
donated to a charity at the choosing of the force. Any other gifts received below this amount

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“should be donated to a locally identified charity”.366 Any hospitality that is offered by the 
MPS is also recorded in the same register.

3.18  The MPS retains hospitality records for a period of seven years, after which they are subject 
to  removal  from  the  MPS  systems  in  line  with  the  appropriate  retention  period.367  The 
guidance also provides an authorisation hierarchy for the purposes of scrutiny and review of 
all hospitality entries. This states that:368

•   “The  Deputy  Mayor  for  Policing  and  Crime  will  review  the  registers  of  the 
Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner every month as part of the publication 
process;

•   The  Deputy  Commissioner  will  review  the  registers  of  Management  Board 

members every month as part of the publication process;

•   Management  Board  members  will  review  the  registers  of  ACPO  officers  and 
Directors (Special Pay Grade – SPG) they are responsible for every month as part 
of the publication process;

•   ACPO  Officers/Directors  (SPG)  will  review  the  local  B/OCU  Registers  for  their 

portfolios every month as part of the publication process;

•   The  B/OCU  Commander  or  Business  Group  lead  will  review  their  local  B/OCU/

Business Group registers every month as part of the publication process.”

3.19  Following this scrutiny exercise, the hospitality records of the MPS Management Board, ACPO 
and equivalent police staff, are published within 15 working days of the end of the month. 
The remainder of hospitality records of officers and  staff below ACPO level are published 
within 20 working days of the end of the month. Systems are established by the Management 
Board members to ensure that officers and staff comply with this policy within their individual 
business groups.369

3.20  The  Director  of  Audit,  Risk  and  Assurance  for  the  MOPC  is  responsible  for  the  internal 
auditing  for  the  MOPC  and  the  Metropolitan  Police  Commission.370  The  current  Director, 
Julie Norgrove, has explained that the introduction of the Audit Commission Act has led to a 
change in the statutory approach of the MPS to auditing, and specifically that:371 

“… in essence, the change meant that previously  the Metropolitan Police was not 
an auditory body, it was the MPA itself, and that’s why the audit service sat within 
that functionality. With the introduction of the Act, that has now changed and the 
Met is an auditory body, as is the MOPC, and therefore both are required to have an 
effective audit service.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG3.21  By comparison, the regional forces and constabularies have less stringent structures in place. 
Avon and Somerset Police provide only very broad guidelines on the registration of hospitality 
that is received. The 2010 Procedural Guidance states that:372

“Each  department  will  keep  and  maintain  a  register  of  gifts  and  hospitality,  both 
refused and received. Managers will review the record regularly (at least annually) to 
ensure the system works and to ensure the integrity of the process.

The register will be available for inspection by a member of the Chief Officers Group 
(COG) at all times. The register for COG will be inspected by the Chief Constable, and 
the register for the Chief Constable will be inspected by the Police Authority.”

Aside from these guidelines, the policy does not go into any depth and is unclear in regards 
to the scrutiny process, the retention period or the publication of hospitality records. Durham 
Constabulary  are  equally  as  vague  on  the  process  of  recording  hospitality,  providing  only 
guidance to this effect, “all lunches/hospitality offered by Contractors and Organisations will 
be recorded on a local register.”373 West Midlands Police only comment on the form of gifts 
which should be recorded, that:374

“all gifts of hospitality, given or received, above the value of £75 should be submitted 
to the Support Services Unit, Corporate Services Department along with form WG450 
via the standards forms page of the intranet.” 

The  force  directive  provides  no  further  guidance  in  regards  to  the  process  of  publishing 
hospitality records. 

3.22  Essex Police also provides a very general guideline, and does not set any precise requirements, 
nor does it specify any formal process for the publication of hospitality records. The policy 
states that “for the protection of individuals, records should be kept locally of all accepted 
hospitality  and  gifts,  other  than  token  items.”375  The  guidance  goes  no  further  other  than 
directing officers and staff to the relevant form which should be completed with the date, 
recipient and nature of the gift or hospitality that has been received. 

3.23  Staffordshire  Police  operates  an  internal,  electronic  database  for  the  management  of 
hospitality records and any gifts or gratuities that have been received by officers and staff. The 
guidelines are similarly broad in relation to the required timescale of the recording process, 
stating that records should be updated by the individual in receipt of the offer, “as soon as is 
reasonably practicable”.376 However there appears to be more attention within this guidance, 
than elsewhere, to the important requirement for an audit trail of such records in order “to 
demonstrate that proper ethical standards have been observed.”377

3.24  A more formal framework exists at the PSNI and British Transport Police. Hospitality registers 
at PSNI are maintained by the District Commanders and Heads of Branches for their respective 
areas, with the exception of any registers for members of the Senior Management Team, of

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGwhich are maintained separately by a Command Secretariat.378 These records are maintained 
in both hard copy and an online register, which is completed with full details of the hospitality 
or gift as a minimum requirement. The registers are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the 
District Commanders and Heads of Branches to ensure that there are no breaches in staff 
conduct, although there is no indication that the hospitality records are published on a regular 
basis by the force.379 British Transport Police (BTP) specifically state that gifts and hospitality 
registers:380

“… will be published in accordance with the Freedom of Information 2009 Publication 
scheme  adopted  by  BTP.  …  [they]  will  be  responsible  for  publishing  the  register 
disclosing gifts and hospitality received and declined by SCT members annually.”

The hospitality records of BTP are kept for a period of four financial years and contain entries 
of all gifts and hospitality that have been received which exceed the value of £15. Officers and 
staff have an obligation to declare these to the Area/Portfolio SPOC within the set timeframe 
of  28  days.381  The  PSDIU  are  responsible  for  producing  a  comprehensive  register  of  these 
declarations, which are then appropriately disclosed in the form of publication on the BTP 
website.382

3.25  The regional forces and constabularies recognise that hospitality records are subject to the 
Freedom of Information Act 2000. For this reason the hospitality records of senior officers are 
routinely published, normally on the force website or held by the relevant department in a 
detailed form, should a freedom of information request be made. The PSNI specifically note 
in their policy directive that:383

“It  must  be  remembered  that  all  entries  will  be  reviewed  by  ACCs/Heads  of 
Departments or, in the case of members of the Senior Management Team, Internal 
Audit, and may also be subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act 
2000. As a result, information must be full enough so that it can be justified at a later 
date.  If  information  is  not  full  enough,  the  authorising  officer  should  seek  further 
information from the member of staff.”

3.26 

It is a safe assumption that the introduction of the ACPO interim guidelines will help to address 
this  issue  and  foster  the  application  of  a  universal  guidance  policy  for  both  the  MPS  and 
all regional forces and constabularies. This will ensure greater clarity on the responsibilities 
of  individual  officers  and  staff,  and  most  importantly  define  the  appropriate  expectations 
of  handling  hospitality  and  gifts,  in  particular,  to  set  formal  procedures  in  relation  to  the 
publication of hospitality records. In the following section, the practical applications of the 
current policies are considered, based on the evidence that the Inquiry has heard.

The reality

3.27  Given the real and understandable concern about the nature of the relationship between 
certain senior officers within the MPS and News International, and the media more generally,

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthe issue of hospitality as between the police and the press has been the subject of much 
scrutiny. I will address this general issue within this section.

3.28 

In considering these matters, it is important to put them into their overall context. Sir Denis 
O’Connor,  formerly  Her  Majesty’s  Chief  Inspector  of  Constabulary,  said  that  a  review  of 
force hospitality registers across England and Wales provided to HMIC for the last five years 
showed 9,500 entries, of which 298 (i.e. less than 3%) related to gratuities and hospitality 
accepted from the media.384 Even allowing for under-recording, the numbers therefore are 
small.  However,  that  is  certainly  not  to  understate  this  issue  given  its  potential  impact  in 
public confidence terms. 

3.29  HMIC’s  report  ‘Without  fear  or  favour  –  a  review  of  police  relationships’  and  Mrs  Filkin’s 
report  ‘The  Ethical  Issues  Arising  from  the  Relationship  between  Police  and  Media’  both 
provide a very useful backdrop to this topic. When considering this issue, HMIC found that:385

“While  all  forces  and  authorities  have  hospitality  and  gratuity  policies,  these  vary 
significantly. Most seek to provide guidelines, but few provide sufficient clarity to staff 
on what is acceptable.” 

Self-evidently,  therefore,  this  is  not  an  issue  that  was  limited  to  the  MPS.  As  the  Home 
Secretary put it:386 

“… in relation to the question of what are appropriate relationships between police 
officers and the media, I think this is a more general issue than simply the Metropolitan 
Police …” 

3.30 

Interestingly, HMIC also recorded that in the absence of clear rules or guidance on this issue:387

“…  police  officers  and  staff  endeavour  to  define  what  should  and  should  not  be 
accepted based on their own concept of what is right and what is wrong and where 
the boundaries of appropriateness lie. There is sound evidence that in doing so junior 
staff understand the impact of their own decisions on the force’s reputation. They 
looked to senior officers to lead by example, although in many cases felt that senior 
leadership was lacking.” 

3.31  Mrs Filkin’s report, although focused specifically on the MPS, identified very similar issues 
and can be read alongside HMIC’s report in terms of the key messages that they impart. More 
particularly, Mrs Filkin found that:388 

“… many of those who spoke to me said that a culture had developed, at some senior 
levels in the organisation, which made it normal, and in some cases expected, that 
contact with the media would be close. In addition, hospitality which is now widely 
considered inappropriate was accepted.”

Mrs Filkin also recorded the opinion of some police officers and staff within the organisation

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGwho felt that there “appeared to be one rule for senior contact with the media and another 
for the rest of the organisation.”389 She expanded on this point and said:390

“Because the publication of the hospitality register and so forth, which had occurred 
for the first time shortly before the summer of last year, many of the police officers and 
staff that I interviewed were obviously highly shocked by the amount of hospitality 
that  the  senior  people  appeared  to  be  receiving;  either  hospitality  in  the  sorts  of 
things of dinners and lunches and so forth at rather expensive restaurants, but also 
some of them were receiving very large numbers of tickets to very expensive sporting 
events, so there were a set of things which some senior people had been receiving, 
others had not, others had not accepted, and that was clear. But many, many of the 
lower ranks people, as I think one of the senior people who was quoted said … I think 
his quote is that people were filling their boots, and that was a very view … That 
was what people were telling me, that it was very much a senior issue. Not entirely 
a senior level … people would say, well, people, yes, have drinks, people might be 
bought the odd meal and so forth at more junior levels, but it was very much in that 
period  of  time  seen  to  be  identified  with  certain  members  of  the  senior  staff  and 
management team.”

3.32  These findings prompted Mrs Filkin to conclude that:391 

“There has been wide variation in how the senior team interpreted policy on dealing 
with the media and receiving gifts and hospitality. In some instances this interpretation 
is seen as inappropriate. There has been no clear standard set by the senior team 
for police officers and staff to use as a guide for their own behaviour and in some 
instances the standards set have been poor and have led to consequent damage.” 

Mrs Filkin recommended that the MPS senior team:392 

“…  must  signal  a  change  in  culture  and  set  a  consistent  example  for  all  staff  on 
the ethical standards they expect, including how they relate to the media and the 
interpretation of the gifts and hospitality register.” 

I would certainly endorse this finding. 

3.33  Within the context of the corporate management of ethical issues, Mrs Filkin also made the 

point that:393

“… during my Inquiry members of the senior team acknowledged that there were 
significant differences of opinion about the need to develop close relationships with 
the media and the appropriateness of receiving extensive hospitality as part of it. The 
importance of collective standards on these issues was either not recognised by some 
of the senior team, or was of secondary importance in a culture where the value of 
independent decision-making at chief officer level is protected.”

The  corporate  management  of  the  organisational  risks  in  this  area  is,  in  my  view,  vitally 
important particularly in relation to a police force’s senior team given the top-down leadership 
role they play in the setting of standards. This is an issue to which I will return.

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG3.34  Commissioner Hogan-Howe certainly recognised the general points made by Mrs Filkin, and 
expressed  his  surprise  at  the  extent  and  the  frequency  of  the  social  interaction  between 
certain senior officers within the MPS and the press.394 In my view, the importance of example 
setting in this area cannot be understated. The Home Secretary reinforced this point when 
she said:395 

“… one of the themes that actually comes out of some of the reports that have taken 
place, that one of the reasons why it’s necessary to put a clearer framework in place for 
everybody within each force is precisely because junior officers may see relationships 
developing and not understand that actually the nature of those relationships may 
be necessary because of the nature of the job that the senior officer is doing but may 
take another message from it.” 

3.35 

It is undoubtedly the case that senior MPS officers had differing approaches to the issue of 
casual hospitality and what was considered by them to be acceptable in this context. It is 
true to say that all of the past Commissioners of the MPS who gave evidence had meetings 
over  drinks  or  meals  with  journalists  to  a  greater  or  lesser  extent.  The  variance  between 
Commissioners in relation to the frequency with which they engaged in this type of interaction 
with the media appeared to be due to a mix in personal style and the media climate in place 
at the time of their Commissionership.

3.36  Lord  Condon  said  that  he  “rarely”  met  with  newspaper  editors  at  restaurants  or  pubs, 

preferring instead to meet on police premises.396 However, he went on to say that:397

“… there were some editors – I don’t think they were being precious, but the demands 
on their time were such that it was clear that if you wanted to meet them, it had to 
be on their terms, at their office or at a restaurant. So over the course of seven years, 
on a small handful of occasions, I may have had the odd meal …”

3.37  More generally, Lord Condon said that he had preferred to keep journalists at a professional 

distance. He explained:398

“I guess it’s a question of personal style and comfort zones and I think over the years, 
in  policing  and  beyond,  I  think  I  understand  the  media,  and  I  think  whilst  you’re 
Commissioner, you have certain professional relationships and you make life more 
difficult for yourself if those professional relationships cross into friendships and a 
social life that goes with friendships. I’m not saying that it’s intrinsically wrong or 
morally or ethically wrong to be friendly or to have a social relationship, but I knew 
where my comfort zone was, and I was more comfortable with it being on very much 
a professional basis. So I may be wrong, but I don’t think I ever invited anyone from 
the media to my home address or I ever went to their home address.”

3.38  A number of witnesses shared this general view. The former Deputy Commissioner of the 
MPS, Tim Godwin, for example, said that his contact with the media had been on a formal

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGbasis,  had  not  been  conducted  socially,  and  never  over  alcohol.399  Mr  Godwin’s  approach 
was borne out of a concern that the “perception of a close relationship [with the media] in 
that way might actually be misinterpreted.”400 Whilst again careful not to suggest that the 
alternative approach was necessarily intrinsically or ethically wrong, Mr Godwin felt that it 
was  important  for  the  MPS  to  maintain  its  “constitutional  separation”  from  the  media.401 
Given that the line between the perception of impropriety and substantive wrongdoing can be 
so nuanced, as recent events have demonstrated, this point becomes all the more important.

3.39  Since leaving the Police Service, Lord Condon’s views on the potential dangers of hospitality 
have hardened. He offered the view that “hospitality can be the start of a grooming process 
which leads to inappropriate and unethical behaviour.”402 He explained that:403

“…  since  leaving  the  service  I  have  gone  on  to  work  and  deal  with  integrity  in 
international sport, and dealing with integrity in the business community, and I think 
it’s just common sense that in any walk of life hospitality can be appropriate, can 
be sensible, can be necessary, can be ethical. But the other side of that, it can lead 
to inappropriate closeness and, in some cases, that can lead to criminal behaviour. 
Certainly in the sporting world I have investigated cases where initial hospitality to 
international sportsmen eventually led to criminal behaviour.” 

3.40  Lord Blair’s evidence in relation to his social interaction with the media was similar in most 

respects to that of Lord Condon. He said that he:404

“…attended the CRA Christmas and summer drinks receptions on one or two occasions. 
I attended garden parties and the like hosted by newspapers. I would occasionally 
share  a  table  with  editors  who  were  sponsoring  public  events,  such  as  the  Police 
Bravery  Awards,  organised  by  the  Sun.  On  some  relatively  rare  occasions  I  would 
have lunch with a journalist … The only hospitality I offered to the media would have 
been the occasional tea or coffee.”

3.41  Lord Stevens’ social contact with the media was more frequent. As has been described, this 
was part of a wider strategy to “raise the morale and restore trust in the MPS.”405  406 Lord 
Stevens described how he:407

“…worked hard to foster good relations with the media. This involved being available 
to speak with editors or journalists. I had lunches with the editors of all the national 
newspapers.” 

Lord  Stevens  argued  that  that  it  would  not  have  been  possible  for  him  to  have  fostered 
professional relationships with national newspaper editors without some form of hospitality.408

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGHe said:409

“Some editors I saw in their offices and some editors I dealt with by way of phone on 
occasion. Specifically if I thought, you know, the stories they were putting out were 
wrong. But in a more relaxed – this is the way they did business. And if you didn’t do 
it that way, they probably wouldn’t see you … Certainly with Mr Dacre, we used to 
have lunch, but he used to have some of his premier journalists there, and I have to 
say, you didn’t concentrate so much on what you were eating because you were held 
to task and you were taken through things, and quite rightly so. With Sir Max, it was 
probably more relaxed because it was sometimes on a one-to-one basis, but he’s a 
man of immense knowledge and I have to say on occasions I learnt more from them 
than they learnt from me, I think.” 

3.42  Whilst he accepted that there was a risk of perception in meeting frequently with the media, 
particularly on a more social basis, Sir Paul Stephenson’s evidence was of a similar nature 
to that of Lord Stevens.410 Sir Paul argued that it was “difficult to see how the Commissioner 
could do his or her job properly” without a significant amount of media engagement at a 
senior level to counter the sometimes unbalanced coverage of the MPS.411 

3.43 

3.44 

It  is  certainly  apparent  that  there  is  increasingly  a  public  facing  dimension  to  the  role  of 
Commissioner, and Chief Constables more generally. I make the point elsewhere that there is 
a difficult balance to be struck in this area. Engagement with the media is an important part 
of the job for the reasons given above. However, great care must be taken to ensure that a 
perception of proximity is not formed, not only because of the obvious reputational damage 
that can be caused, but also because of the importance of providing an appropriate example 
to other ranks within the Police Service. 

It is also clear that a difference in approach to the issue existed at other senior ACPO ranks 
within the MPS. John Yates and Andy Hayman, both formerly Assistant Commissioners in the 
MPS, for example, appear to have accepted casual hospitality to a greater degree than their 
ACPO colleagues.412 I consider the evidence of Mr Yates and Mr Hayman later in this Chapter. 
Suffice it say at this stage, both examples provide an emphatic illustration of the point made 
above  in  relation  to  the  reputational  damage  that  can  be  caused  should  a  perception  of 
proximity be formed. 

3.45  Despite the self-evident risks, it is worthy of note in this context that other senior officers 
who took a different approach to their interaction with the media, saw no ethical difficulty in 
meeting with a journalist in a more social setting.413 Colin Port, Chief Constable of Avon and 
Somerset Police, went further by suggesting that it was not necessarily possible to discern 
what was acceptable from the nature of the hospitality. He said:414

“I trust and rely upon the discretion of my staff. They make life-and-death decisions

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGday in and day out, and if I can’t trust them to decide that a cup of coffee or a glass 
of wine or a pint of beer at the appropriate time is not appropriate, then I’ve lost the 
plot.” 

3.46  Mr Port, however, went on to make the point that any hospitality received must pass a ‘blush’ 

test as to what the public would consider to be acceptable.415 

3.47  That being said, there was a general acceptance from those within the policing world that there 
were additional dangers engaged where meetings were conducted in a social environment. 
Lynne Owens, Chief Constable of Surrey Police, for example, said that:416 

“I think the challenge of a social setting is if you are in that environment and you’re 
drinking alcohol, then there is perhaps an expectation that you will say some things 
that you wouldn’t say in a more formalised setting…” 

Dick Fedorcio, formerly the Director of Public Affairs for MPS, who generally saw value in the 
utility of social interaction with the media, also agreed that alcohol could increase the risk of 
gossip or inappropriate commentary.417 

3.48  From the perspective of the journalists that gave evidence, it is clear that their life blood 
is  information,  much  of  which  is  obtained  by  talking  to  those  with  a  direct  knowledge  of 
the matters in which the journalist is interested at that time. It is often the case that this 
interaction  is  facilitated  through  face-to-face  contact.  A  number  of  witnesses  argued  that 
the most socially acceptable way of achieving this was to engage over a meal or a drink. Mr 
Fedorcio, for example, said that given the practicalities of both professions:418 

“… very often a lunchtime was seen as a good time by both parties to do it. On other 
occasions, it wasn’t. A lot of crime reporters, for example, would spend time in court, 
so their hours were restricted between sort of morning and during the afternoon, so 
lunchtime was a break, or later in the day, evenings and so on. It varied in some ways. 
Some journalists didn’t have that problem, they didn’t attend court, they were happy 
to do it whatever time of the day you could fit them in the diary, but for others it was 
more of a practicality.” 

3.49 

It appears that this form of interaction was commonly regarded as a reasonable bargain if the 
food or drink was purchased by the journalist. This is perhaps implicitly confirmed by the fact 
that the vast majority of journalists from whom I heard were permitted, to a greater or lesser 
extent, to claim for such expenses from their employers.419 Indeed, a number of witnesses 
made the point that this practice was commonplace, and emphasised that it was not just 
police  officers  who  were  the  subject  of  casual  hospitality  from  journalists.  Sandra  Laville, 
crime correspondent for the Guardian, argued that social interaction of this sort was:420

“… part of human relationships. I think if an officer has worked all day and takes time 
out from his family to come and meet me, I see nothing wrong with buying him a

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGdrink or having a meal with him. As long as it’s reasonable, as long as common sense 
is applied, I see it as part of normal human relationships, and journalists do it with 
every profession. They do it with doctors, they do it with trade union leaders, they 
do it with lawyers, they do it with pharmaceutical companies. You know, scientific 
reporters do it with scientists.” 

3.50  Ms Laville also spoke for most, if not all, of the journalists who gave evidence when she said 
the following in response to Lord Condon’s observation that hospitality could be the start of 
a ‘grooming process’. She said:421

“… I think it’s a very strong thing to say. I think, as I’ve said, there’s criminality and 
then  there’s  legitimate  journalistic  activity,  and  socialising  to  a  reasonable  extent, 
using common sense, with police officers is not a grooming process. These people are 
grown-ups. Some of them make life or death decisions … they deal with organised 
crime, they investigate rape. You know, the idea that me buying them a couple of 
beers or a meal is grooming them in any way is faintly ludicrous, to be honest. I don’t 
agree with that.”

3.51  The notion that it is reasonable and appropriate for police officers or police staff to meet 
with journalists and discuss issues with them over a light working lunch found favour with a 
number of witnesses. Anne Campbell, Head of Corporate Communications for Norfolk and 
Suffolk Constabularies, for example, said that:422

“…I think there has to be caution, but I actually think a lot of it falls into that area 
of common sense. I mean, journalists from time immemorial – and I used to be a 
journalist – are used to, I suppose, having drinks in bars and that would be one way 
of chatting to make relationships. It’s probably moved on since then. I don’t actually 
believe it’s acceptable to purchase alcohol, but I think for low level-level expenses 
or refreshments, then those expenses are justifiable because it is part and parcel of 
the role. How else would I be able to have fairly private conversations with senior 
members of the media to discuss the massive changes affecting the Police Service?”

3.52  Deputy  Commissioner  Craig  Mackey  provided  similar  evidence.  He  suggested  that  the 

question was one of proportion and balance:423 

“… It might be entirely appropriate over a working lunch to have a sandwich, a pizza 
or a cup of coffee, but actually outside the working day in other environments, you 
begin to get to the point where you have to question (a) your own values, but also 
why are you doing it? Why are you there?” 

He also favoured was has previously been described as a ‘blush test’:424

“… it ought to be the sort of thing that when you write it in the hospitality register and 
it appears on the force Internet, you’re entirely comfortable in terms of what you’ve 
done and why you’ve done it, and be very clear that there is a professional reason and 
basis on why you’re accepting hospitality…”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG3.53  Ms  Laville  offered  a  view  as  to  what  should  be  considered  acceptable  and  appropriate  in 
this context. She argued that the offer of casual hospitality involving, for example, expensive 
meals and alcohol, fell within the ambit of the Bribery Act:425 

“… I think if it’s not reasonable, if you’re repeatedly taking an officer to the Savoy 
and throwing in a lap dancing club repeatedly, obviously  that’s not reasonable or 
common sense and it potentially is illegal, so there’s your criminality.” 

As to what she felt was a “reasonable level” of hospitality, Ms Laville said:426

“… there’s a guideline at the Guardian that it should be no more than £40 to £45 for 
two people having a meal, but I mean sometimes it goes above that. Obviously we 
live in London. But, you know, reasonable amount.”

3.54  A number of the journalists who gave evidence also argued that there was no link between 
the level of the casual hospitality offered and the amount or type of information received. 
Stephen Wright, the associate news editor of the Daily Mail, said that:427

“… whenever I’ve had lunch or dinner with someone, there’s no strings attached. I fully 
respect that. If they don’t want to talk in an authorised way…It would be completely 
inappropriate  to  lavish  hospitality  on  a  junior  officer  –  any  officer,  frankly.  I  don’t 
think that is the issue at all, certainly not the way I operate, it would be completely 
inappropriate.”

3.55 

John Twomey, crime reporter at the Daily Express, made an associated point, by suggesting 
that the standard of the restaurant frequented was linked to the rank of the police officer 
concerned and the need for privacy, rather than as a method of obtaining more information.428 
In relation to this issue more generally, Mr Twomey conceded that his working relationship 
with police officers “could be done in a police station or at Scotland Yard, quite clearly”429, 
however, he argued that it was “a convivial and convenient and more comfortable way of 
meeting. But clearly you don’t have to have the food and drink element.”430 Despite conceding 
that there could be a question of perception in relation to interaction of this sort, Mr Twomey 
did not accept that the offer of casual hospitality was an inducement to the police officer 
concerned.431 He said:432

“… it does go on in a business world. It goes on in Parliament. Defence correspondents 
meet  army  officers  in  their  clubs,  in  restaurants.  It  doesn’t  mean  to  say  they’re 
knocking back £400 bottles of champagne…there’s a tradition there, and I think they 
would expect it. They don’t want to be stuck in Scotland Yard when they could be 
out  in  a  comfortable  place…in  surroundings  with  people  they  know  and  they  can 
trust…I don’t think you should lose that. I think…there’s a question of flexibility…if 
new rules, should they be introduced, if they’re too strict…it will make it more difficult 
for reporters like me to get access to information, to get access to officers. If you only

more likely to be toeing the party line, as it were…it would be a shame to lose that 
because it makes everything so formal and restricted.”

3.56 

It was also argued by some that this issue has become somewhat overstated. Michael Sullivan, 
crime editor at The Sun, made the point that:433

“… there’s been a lot of mention in this Inquiry about long lunches and reporters or 
journalists entertaining lavishly, bottles of champagne. My experience actually is that 
those lunching and buying dinners have become an increasing rarity over the last few 
years, and that was really perhaps as Fleet Street sobered up or perhaps as the police 
became  more  professional  with  alcohol  taken  during  working  hours.  The  normal 
social setting would be in a pub, or possibly a wine bar, but more likely a pub, and it 
wouldn’t be a case of the reporter handing over a credit card behind the bar and let’s 
go and drink as much as possible. It would be a case of the journalist buying a round 
of drinks and the police officer buying a round of drinks in those social settings…”

3.57  The general evidence of the police forces outside of London was that casual hospitality was 
conducted at a limited level. The Chief Constable of South Wales Police, Peter Vaughan, for 
example, told the Inquiry that he would meet the media for the purposes of interviews or 
press conferences.434 In addition to these meetings, he has also attended charity fundraisers, 
where the media were present, as well as sporting events within the force area. Mr Vaughan 
provided an example where he was invited to a rugby match by Media Wales, which was also 
attended  by  a  Welsh  government  minister,  as  well  as  “another  key  individual  from  Welsh 
society”. He explained that:435

“…it was deemed as an opportunity to go along to meet people in a social surrounding 
that wasn’t necessarily a formal office environment, and to step on them, to develop 
some sort of relationship rather than retrench and dig myself in.”

He told the Inquiry that is had been an opportunity for him to address the issues that were 
affecting the force at that time:436 

“…it felt right at that moment … from the inaccuracy being reported by the Police 
Review…  it  just  presented  itself  as  an  opportunity  then  to  start  to  put  the  record 
straight.”

3.58  Mr Vaughan went on to explain that the meetings were “fully documented in the Force Media 
Register”.437  Hospitality  recorded  included  the  provision  of  drinks  or  refreshments  by  the 
media.438 Catherine Llewellyn, a press officer for South Wales Police, told the Inquiry that 
there had not been an occasion where any hospitality has been accepted or offered to the

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGmedia on her behalf.439 Typically, meetings which took place between the force and the media 
were conducted in the offices of South Wales Police, or Media Wales.440

3.59  The editor of the South Wales Echo, Timothy Gordon described the relatively minimal level 
of contact between himself and officers of South Wales Police. He has said that the majority 
of contact is made by the reporters of his title. He has told the Inquiry that the other titles 
of Media Wales Limited, publishers of the South Wales Echo, including the Western Mail and 
Wales on Sunday, also have infrequent contact with the local force. Describing one example 
of a meeting he attended in March 2011 with the Chief Constable and Deputy Chief Constable 
of South Wales Police, the editor in chief of the Western Mail, and the editor of Wales on 
Sunday, Mr Gordon told the Inquiry that:441 

“There was no hospitality at the meeting, which was held at the Media Wales offices, 
beyond a cup of tea/coffee/glass of water being offered.”

Mr  Vaughan  also  noted  in  his  evidence  that  this  meeting  was  deliberately  arranged  after 
lunch, as he told the Inquiry that he does not dine socially with editors or journalists, and has 
not been invited to any lunches or dinners of this kind.442 Mr Gordon asserted that as editor 
of the South Wales Echo, he has never accepted any hospitality from the local force, as far as 
he could recall, with the exception of “a cup of tea … may have been the offer of a biscuit”.443 

3.60  Abigail Ashford, the crime correspondence for the South Wales Echo, echoed the absence 
of any culture of accepting hospitality from the local force. Ms Ashford explained just one 
occasion  where  she  attended  a  Cardiff  v  Swansea  football  game,  at  no  expense,  whilst 
‘shadowing’ the Inspector of South Wales Police. The purpose of this exercise was to report 
on how the local force policed the event.444 She said that the extent of hospitality that was 
offered was “a sandwich and a cup of tea from their own catering, but I also bought food for 
myself.”445 Ms Ashford could not recall any other occasions where she had received hospitality 
from South Wales Police.

3.61  Chris Sims, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, told the Inquiry that he would meet 
occasionally with editors of the local papers, but not very often. He stressed the absence of a 
culture of hospitality between the force and the local media, stating that there are very few 
occasions that the force have accepted hospitality from the media, and specifically, that he 
has never accepted any.446 Mr Sims referred to only one occasion in 2005, where a number of 
West Midlands Police officers attended a local football match, courtesy of a local newspaper 
title, which had included the invitations to other prominent figures within the community.447

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGWith the exception of this event, he could not recall any other instances where the force had 
accepted offers of hospitality from the local press, other than the acceptance of refreshments 
or drinks.448  

3.62  Chief Inspector Sally Seeley, told the Inquiry that she was not aware of any instances where 
there had been an acceptance of hospitality from the media by any of the ACPO rank members 
of the force. However, Ms Seeley recognised the necessity of building effective relationships 
with the media and said that:449

“Clearly it would be counterproductive to create an environment where all invitations 
of hospitality were refused and that would be at odds with the accepted norms of 
society. Acceptable hospitality falls within these norms and I believe include accepting 
a drink or some light refreshments having regard for the time, duration and context 
of the engagement.”

3.63  Mr Sims told the Inquiry that West Midlands Police no longer provide a ‘Christmas Reception’ 
for the local press, which had previously been held at West Midlands Police Headquarters 
up until 2007.450 Since this change, the exchange of hospitality has been minimal, other than 
the offers of simple refreshments accompanying meetings between officers and the media. 
Adrian Faber, editor of the Express & Star in Wolverhampton, attested to this view, stating 
that his title have not been offered (or indeed accepted) any hospitality from West Midlands 
Police.451 

3.64  Mr Faber has explained the basic level of hospitality offered by his title would be in the form 
of  lunches  which  would  take  place  at  the  newspaper’s  offices.  These  lunches  had  taken 
place with the previous Chief Constable and senior officers of West Midlands Police. He also 
explained that a corporate hospitality arrangement existed between the Express & Star with 
Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion local football clubs, whereby match 
tickets  have  often  been  offered  to  police  officers,  but  are  not  exclusively  sought  for  this 
purpose.452 Mr Faber told the Inquiry that “[we] regularly take contacts and advertisers to 
local football matches”453 and that he “has not taken any police officer since [2009] as tickets 
have been used by other people in the company.”454

3.65  This, as well as the title’s annual Local Heroes Awards, is the only form of hospitality that 
the  Express  &  Star  would  offer  to  West  Midlands  Police.  The  hospitality  would  consist  of 
a meal, drinks and in the case of the football matches, the value of the ticket for watching 
the game. Mr Faber’s crime reporters have also informally met with police officers over a 
drink, as a way of discussing their work, but such an offer is not “considered to be a ‘reward’ 
for information”.455 In his evidence to the Inquiry, he emphasised that “you’re able to have

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGa  perfectly  professional  relationship  [with  the  police]  without  elaborate  entertainment  or 
socialising.”456

3.66 

In summarising this issue, Commissioner Hogan-Howe said:457

“… there’s no doubt that police officers and the press will meet on social occasions. 
The question is if the only reason for the meeting is around their social interaction 
and if complicated by alcohol, it seems to me there is a risk that in fact … judgment 
is  clouded  and  the  relationship  develops  in  another  way.  I  suppose  for  the  Police 
Service,  it  seems  to  be  important  to  say  that  at  least  for  appearances,  but  more 
fundamentally because of the way we should operate, because of the probity of the 
way we operate, we need to leave the perception that we are not tainted by being 
too close to any part of society. That can sometimes isolate us. So I think we have to 
make sure we’re not isolated, but I think at times that just by what might be seen by 
some as austere, provided we have a good professional relationship, provided we’re 
open about it and provided that therefore we can be held account, we’re … probably 
[in] the right place.”

3.67  ACPO  have  sought  to  address  this  issue  through  the  issuing  of  revised  national  guidance 
on  gifts,  gratuities  and  hospitality  (the  guidance  was  implemented  on  18  October  2012). 
The guidance provides “police officers and police staff with a framework to determine the 
boundaries  of  acceptability  regarding  the  receipt  of  gifts  and  hospitality.”458  Importantly, 
given the variation in practice identified by HMIC, the guidance is to be used by forces “to 
review  and,  where  necessary,  adapt  existing  policies  and  procedure  for  dealing  with  gifts, 
gratuities and hospitality.”459 The guidance also reminds forces that they have a responsibility 
to ensure that their staff “understand how the acceptance of gifts, gratuities or hospitality 
can undermine personal and professional integrity.”460 

3.68  The general principle underpinning the guidance is one of blanket non-acceptability, save for 

limited exceptions. The Home Secretary, for one, favoured this approach. She said:461 

“I  think  that  is  a  sensible  approach  that  has  been  taken  by  ACPO  in  an  attempt 
obviously  to  find  a  greater  consistency  …  what  is  important  is  that  they  have  the 
single force register but that everybody knows that there is a general belief that they 
should not be taking gifts, gratuities and hospitality except where, as it says there, of 
a more trivial nature.” 

She also re-emphasised the importance of perception in this context:462 

“… the expectation is officers should not put themselves in a position where people 
could feel that they were being influenced by the receipt of such gifts, gratuities or 
hospitality.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG3.69  The guidance sets out the circumstances in which hospitality may, or may not, be accepted. 

Given its relevance I reproduce it in full:463

“Hospitality may be accepted if it:
•   extends  to  the  impromptu  provision  of  light  refreshments  during  the  course  of 

policing duties

•   is a conventional meal provided during the course of the working day by another 

police force or partner agency in either law enforcement or community safety

In either case, there should be no requirement to declare any such hospitality in the 
force register

Hospitality may also be accepted if it is a conventional meal and is in accordance with 
the recipient’s duties such as:
•   attending a meeting, seminar or conference organised by an external body
•   the annual dinner of a representative association or local authority which is limited 
to isolated or infrequent occasions and can be demonstrably in the interests of the 
force to attend

Such offers of hospitality should be declared in the force register

Hospitality will not be acceptable if it:
•   amounts to regular free or discounted food or refreshments on duty, or off duty 
where the hospitality offered is made because the recipient is a police officer or 
member of police staff

•   includes a degree of lavishness which is outside of the industry norm or is beyond 

any sense of common courtesy or reasonableness

Such offers of hospitality should be declared in the force register.”

3.70 

I would certainly endorse the key principles contained within this guidance. Without wanting 
to be overly prescriptive or puritanical on this issue, I think that it should more specifically 
spell out the dangers of consuming alcohol in a casual hospitality setting (without necessarily 
specifying a blanket ban); it also strikes me that the concept of an “industry norm” in this 
context may still allow for a variance in practice from force to force, and may tend to assume 
what needs to be established. However, I would certainly adopt in full the guidance provided 
to police officers (at all levels) and police staff in helping them to determine the boundaries 
of what is acceptable:464 

“Is it genuine? Is the offer made for reasons of genuine appreciation for something 
I  have  done?  Why  is  the  offer  being  made?  What  are  the  circumstances?  Have  I 
solicited this offer in any way or does the donor feel obliged to make this offer?

Is it independent? Would the offer or acceptance be seen as reasonable in the eyes of 
the public? Would a reasonable bystander be confident I could remain impartial and 
independent in all of the circumstances?

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGIs  it  free?  Will  I  feel  obliged  to  do  something  in  return?  How  do  I  feel  about  the 
propriety of the offer? What are the donor’s expectations of me should I accept?

Is it transparent? Would I be comfortable if my acceptance of this offer was transparent 
to colleagues, the force, and the public or if it was reported publicly? What could be 
the outcome for the force if this offer was accepted or declined.” 

3.71 

It is also vital that transactional change in the form of new policies and guidance is aligned with 
real cultural change. As the evidence has made clear, leadership can be the key determining 
factor in this regard. Given this, it is important that a challenging and transparent environment 
exists within each force area so that staff at all levels (including Chief Officers) understand what 
is expected of them in terms of issues of integrity. Again, this is an issue to which I will return.

4.	 The	perception	of	influence
4.1  Mr Jay provided the context to this section of the Report when he described some of the 
inherent risks engaged when individual members of two powerful institutions or groups of 
institutions, in this case the press and the police, come into contact. He said in the opening 
to Module 2:465 

“…  As  so  often  happens  in  human  affairs,  the  difference  between  healthy  and 
dysfunctional  behaviours  does  not  have  to  be  vast.  By  this,  I  mean  at  least  two 
things: first, that it does not necessarily take many rotten apples to undermine the 
whole body politic, and secondly, that very often it does not take many adjustments 
in behaviours, objectively measured, to turn what is good into what is bad and vice 
versa. More precisely, the potential for abuse on both sides of this bilateral equation 
is significant, leading to the risk, if not the reality, of unhealthy, over-cosy and overly 
close  relations  between  the  two  …  Ultimately,  the  vice  here  is  lack  of  democratic 
accountability and the perception, if not the reality, of personal gain. The noun “gain” 
in this context needs, of course, to be broadly interpreted and should certainly be apt 
to accommodate the enhancement of an individual’s professional or personal profile.” 

4.2 

Lord Blair was of a similar view and he told the Inquiry:466 

“I believe that where that problem may have become significant is that a very small 
number of relatively senior officers increasingly became too close to journalists, not 
I believe for financial gain but for the enhancement of their reputation and for the 
sheer enjoyment of being in a position to share and divulge confidences. It is a siren 
song …” 

4.3 

This  qualitative  description  of  the  issue  at  hand  was  supported  by  the  findings  contained 
within Mrs Filkin’s report ‘The Ethical Issues Arising From The Relationship Between Police 
And Media’.467 Mrs Filkin stated that it was the perception of the public and some journalists 
that unethical relationships between the media and the MPS had existed and caused harm.468 
Furthermore, she recorded that:469

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“Many of those who spoke to me said that a culture had developed, at some senior 
levels in the organisation, which made it normal, and in some cases expected, that 
contact with the media would be close.” 

4.4 

Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick acknowledged that a perception had been created that 
some senior officers had developed overly close relationships with certain parts of the media. 
She said:470

“I think it is certainly a perception. There’s no doubt about that, and this has clearly 
been discussed here and widely in the media. It is also the case that there’s been very 
regular and close contact between some senior members of the Met. I should say I 
think all of these issues are not, of course, completely confined to the Met, but that’s 
what we’re focusing on here. I think some of the contact had led to the perception. 
I can’t tell whether it’s been overly close, but in terms of whether it’s been wrong 
or right, what I can say is that I think it’s been unfortunate that it has led to that 
perception, and I think for the future we will have to be clearer about the professional 
boundaries between us and members of the media.” 

4.5 

Sir  Hugh  Orde,  President  of  ACPO,  expressed  his  surprise  at  some  of  the  “quite  close 
relationships between individual chiefs and certain media outlets”.471 In seeking to quantify 
the potential damage caused by this phenomenon, he suggested that:472

“I think you should be concerned because it goes to the heart of the reputation of the 
service generally, so it is an important factor …” 

4.6 

Commissioner Hogan-Howe recognised the fundamental importance of this point and said:473 

“… because of the probity of the way we operate, we need to leave the perception 
that we are not tainted by being too close to any part of society …” 

The reputational harm that can be caused should the alternative be perceived is perhaps 
best illustrated by the allegation that the MPS deliberately did not pursue Operation Caryatid 
further, or reopen it in 2009 and 2010, because of the closeness of the relationship between 
some of its senior officers and News International (NI).

4.7 

This allegation was acknowledged by Commissioner Hogan-Howe who said:474

“… it’s left the perception, at least, which is maybe rebuttable but is an assumption 
which has to be challenged, which is that it may have influenced in some way the 
thoroughness  of  that  investigation.  And  that’s  an  unfortunate  place  to  be  for  a 
police officer, to have to start addressing that before they explain why they did or 
didn’t  do  something.  It  can  be  hard  enough  sometimes  to  explain  why  you  did  or 
didn’t do something even when it’s a very straightforward case where there can be 
no allegation that there was bias  involved, but where there’s an establishment of 
some perception of bias, then it leaves a police officer in a difficult position if that 
investigation doesn’t go as well as it should. There are many reasons we fail. We fail

do our job properly. I think people can accept human error. What the except[ion] is 
that if that’s contaminated by a perception of prejudice.” 

4.8 

One  of  the  key  issues  of  concern  identified  by  Mrs  Filkin  in  her  report’s  analysis  of  the 
relationship between the media and the MPS was the perception that the access provided 
to the media by the DPA had not been impartial. This, she said, was a view that had been 
expressed  internally  and  externally.475  She  concluded  that  the  perception  that  access  was 
provided unequally was:476

“… widespread and damaging, whatever the reality of its impact on the independence 
of decision making within the MPS …”

and suggested that:477 

“…  some  journalists  felt  very  much  cut  out  of  the  club,  as  it  were.  Some  crime 
journalists feel that they haven’t been allowed into the Crime Reporters Association, 
and other journalists feel that because they’re seen as difficult – I would say in many 
instances good at scrutinising – that they were in the past given short shrift.” 

If true, it might be said that the obvious corollary to this is that any journalist brought into 
the ‘club’ would be less likely to write a critical piece of a particular police officer or perhaps 
a force as a whole. As to this, Mrs Filkin said:478

“That would be the implication. How often that occurred, I don’t know.” 

4.9  Mrs Filkin stated that the perception around inequality of access appeared to have grown 
as a result of a particular style of leadership within the DPA and that this style legitimised 
“informal contact lacking in transparency and allowed exclusionary practices to develop.”479 
Mrs Filkin developed this point by saying:480 

“… the person who was the senior person in that department was said by a considerable 
number of people who spoke to me to have set that tone and that style within that 
department, and that – made it clear that certain newspapers were favoured over 
others …” 

Mrs Filkin’s reference to ‘certain newspapers’ was “mainly”481 aimed at the NI stable although 
she accepted that “it may have been wider than that.”482 

Dick Fedorcio

4.10  The ‘senior person’ referred to by Mrs Filkin in her evidence was the former Director of Public 
Affairs  for  the  MPS,  Dick  Fedorcio.  Mr  Fedorcio  recognised  that  it  was  important  for  the 
credibility of the DPA for that department to have been seen to serve “all the media equally

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGand  impartially.”483  He  did  not  however  accept  that  anyone  had  “benefited  through  their 
relationships with me or any of my staff.”484 The extent to which this may, or may not, have 
been true is tested throughout the remainder of this section of the report. Mr Fedorcio did 
accept in hindsight that, at the very least, a perception had been created that the relations of 
some senior officers within the MPS and the media had become too close. He said:485 

 “I think at the time I didn’t see it that way. When I look at it now, in view of everything 
what’s gone on, I would agree with that view.” 

Whilst disputing the underlying fact, Mr Fedorcio also accepted Mrs Filkin’s observation that, 
at the very least, a perception had been created that certain organs of the press had been 
favoured  over  others,  in  particular  NI  titles.  He  said  “if  she  found  that  perception,  then  it 
exists.”486 

4.11  As to the reality, Mr Fedorcio argued that within the DPA there had been no preference for 
one newspaper over another and that the approach had been one of even-handedness. That 
being said, he did acknowledge that in respect of the printed media, contact had been skewed 
in favour of the tabloid press because generally speaking, they had been more interested 
in policing, as they were likely to obtain the sort of sensational stories they needed from 
the  criminal  justice  system.487  By  way  of  illustration,  Mr  Fedorcio  suggested  that  the  DPA 
had sought to avoid situations where a journalist, who may have had a friend in the MPS, 
was then given information to the detriment of other members of the press.488 Mr Fedorcio 
described how he sought to maintain an even-handed approach to media access:489

“… by an awareness amongst myself, the chief press officer, the deputy director, of all 
the activity that is going on across the department. So it would be an assessment. Not 
that there’s anything recorded but it would be an assessment of: we think that over 
time everyone has had a fair share of access to what’s going on.”

4.12  The position described by Mr Fedorcio was generally supported by the diaries of Commissioners 
which showed that there had been a wide spread of meetings with various titles. Lord Blair, 
for example, stated that “I think the spread of the meetings that are recorded indicate that it 
was pretty much across the board.”490 However, Mr Fedorcio did concede that there had been 
no formal structure in place within the DPA to ensure that access for the press to the MPS 
was fair and equitable.491 That being the case, it is perhaps easy to see how a perception of 
enhanced access for some could have developed. Mr Fedorcio reported that such a system

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGwas  now  in  operation,  and  agreed  that  it  had  been  a  sensible  step  forward.492  I  can  only 
agree. Similarly, Mr Fedorcio stated that the DPA had not previously adjusted its relationship 
with journalists on the basis that there had been a perception that there had been too much 
contact in the past.493

4.13  The MPS had clearly recognised the risk of its senior officers being perceived as being too 
close  to  a  particular  media  outlet  and  the  potential  damage  that  could  be  done  to  the 
reputation of the organisation as a result. Sir Paul Stephenson, then Deputy Commissioner 
of the MPS, asked Mr Fedorcio to draft a media relations policy for the MPS management 
board to guide their relationship with the media.494 The policy, entitled ‘Management Board 
and the Media’, was published in February 2008.495 Mr Fedorcio described the background to 
the document:496

“… I was asked to look at producing additional guidance for how management board 
themselves  should  operate,  both  as  a  reminder  to  the  individuals,  how  we  expect 
them to operate, and also to reinforce to them their responsibilities  to make sure 
their staff are aware of the policy and followed it.” 

4.14  The policy instructed management board members to:497 

“… avoid being too accessible to journalists in any way that could compromise their 
position or lead to accusations of favouring any particular media outlet or providing 
unauthorised information to them.” 

Mr Fedorcio confirmed that the risk of a perception being formed that the DPA, or the MPS 
more generally, were favouring a particular media outlet had been on his radar for a number 
of months prior to the issuing of the new management board media policy.498 

4.15  Given his position on the MPS management board,499 it could be argued in respect of Mr 
Fedorcio that this policy was not adhered to. Mr Fedorcio stated that to perform his role 
effectively, he was encouraged, by the then Commissioner Lord Stevens, to:500

“get out and network extensively with the media and meet with journalists to build 
positive and credible relationships for myself and the MPS.” 

He suggested that the purpose of his networking was to “have a wide range of contacts”501 
within the media with whom he would “be in touch”502 regularly. This networking activity 
included meeting with journalists who usually, but not exclusively, belonged to the Crime 
Reporters Association (CRA) at a bar close to Scotland Yard – often following the Commissioner’s

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGregular CRA briefing sessions.503 As to the cast list of the journalists attending these informal 
‘networking’ sessions, Mr Fedorcio said:504

“It would vary. It would vary, depending on attendance at the briefing in the first 
place and the availability of the people afterwards to do that. I mean, some had to 
disappear, but there were, I don’t know, normally maybe half a dozen upwards who 
would attend.” 

4.16  Given the length of his tenure with the MPS,505 Mr Fedorcio accepted that over time he had 
“inevitably”506  got  to  know  the  journalists  with  whom  he  had  been  meeting  regularly  on 
a  rolling  basis,  a  number  of  which  he  had  been  seeing  for  years  although,  as  he  pointed 
out, there would also have been “changes of face during this time. Various journalists have 
retired or moved on to other specialisms and new ones have come in.”507 Despite the enduring 
nature of some of his relationships with individual journalists, he stated that they were all 
“work-related professional contacts”508 and that no personal friendships had resulted from 
his extensive networking activities. On this he said, “I have no personal contact with any of 
the journalists that I’ve dealt with in my time at the Metropolitan Police.”509 

4.17  This  may  indeed  have  been  true  from  Mr  Fedorcio’s  point  of  view,  although  it  is  easy  to 
see how the opposite perception may have been formed, not least by those with whom he 
was interacting. Michael Sullivan, crime reporter for The Sun, for example, suggested that he 
considered himself to have been part of Mr Fedorcio’s ‘inner circle’ of favoured journalists. 
He said:510

“I would probably say I was, sir, yes. If – “favoured journalists”? I don’t know that that 
was – that wouldn’t necessarily tell the whole story, sir. I think Dick, if I can call him 
that since he’s a friend as well as professional contact, over a period of time you get to 
know someone well and therefore you would normally expect to perhaps have more 
contact with that person, not just Dick, but with plenty of others, rather than someone 
arriving – say, for instance, another newspaper has appointed a crime reporter. In 
the same way that I didn’t know Mike Brammett(?) or Sarah Cullum, because I was 
an inexperienced reporter at the time, there would perhaps be reporters arriving or 
being made crime reporters who would then take – it does take a number of years 
to build up a good working relationship, so I think that would – “favour” is perhaps 
not totally applicable but perhaps I would regard myself as part of a group of … long-
serving crime reporters who would have been in a circle of trusted journalists for Mr 
Fedorcio to talk to.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG4.18  This notion of a favoured grouping or ‘inner circle’ of journalists would appear to have been 
recognised by other members of the press reporting on the MPS at the time. Jeff Edwards, 
former Chairman of the CRA and currently its President, said:511 

“I wouldn’t like to use the word “favourites”, but I think there were people he had 
more contact with than with others. Again, I don’t necessarily think you can draw 
any conclusions from that, but I think there were – as I said, I think that there were 
possibly  some  organisations,  for  instance  News  International,  possibly  Associated 
Newspapers, that I think he was more keen to engage with than others.” 

4.19  Similarly, Ms Laville said:512

“I think there was something of an inner circle that was created, but to my perception 
that was more about the length of time certain individuals had been covering crime 
and they had built relationships over many years; in fact, you know, seven or eight 
years, and they knew each other very well. But, yes, there was certainly at times a 
perception that you would have a briefing and then maybe another briefing with a 
smaller group of people would go on, but, you know, then you negotiate that and 
you make sure you get in the smaller briefing. I mean, that’s what journalists do. It’s 
our job to go to the source of the information and find it out … it never struck me as 
anything dodgy, it just struck me as these people were good at their jobs and, you 
know, they’d managed to make a very good contact over many years.”

4.20  Although Ms Laville was careful not to suggest that Mr Fedorcio, or the DPA more generally, had 
in fact favoured certain news organisations with enhanced access or through the provision of 
information, she did agree that it would be “unhealthy” for such a perception to exist.513 There 
was certainly a lack of transparency as to the level and nature of Mr Fedorcio’s interaction 
with the media. He acknowledged, for example, that the MPS gifts and hospitality register 
did not record the occasions where he had met with journalists for drinks at a wine bar.514 It 
is also true to say that most of his more social interaction with the media was conducted on 
a one-to-one basis.515

4.21  The hospitality that was recorded within the MPS’ gifts and hospitality register is worthy of 
some more detailed analysis. In assessing the period between 2003 and 2008, for example, 
a distinct pattern emerges. In the year 2003, Mr Fedorcio went on accompanied hospitality 
visits to seven different newspapers, with The Sun and the NoTW being the only newspapers 
that  were  visited  twice.516  He  also  met  with  journalists  from  a  total  of  seven  different 
newspapers for individual lunches. Mr Fedorcio met with Lucy Panton of the NoTW on three 
occasions, and therefore more than any other individual journalist. He also met with Andy 
Coulson, then editor of the NoTW, on a separate occasion, taking the total number of lunches 
with NoTW journalists to four. This equalled the total number of his interactions with the 
Evening Standard, the other leader in terms of his contact with individual titles for the year 
in question.517

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG4.22  Taking the remaining years in turn, Mr Fedorcio met with the NoTW most often in 2004; the 
same was also true in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, several newspapers came in equally, with 
Mr  Fedorcio  meeting  with  the  NoTW,  The  Sun,  the  Express  (through  John  Twomey,  in  his 
capacity as a senior member of the CRA), and the Evening Standard on an identical number 
of occasions. Finally in 2008, Mr Fedorcio met with The Sun most often.518 

4.23  Mr  Fedorcio  accepted  that  the  record  of  his  interaction  with  the  media  for  the  period  in 
question accorded with his recollection of events.519 In taking the level, but not at this stage 
the nature, of Mr Fedorcio’s contact with NI as a whole, it could be argued that there was 
a  rational  basis  for  it  being  skewed  in  their  favour.  Sir  Paul  Stephenson,  for  example,  in 
analysing his own contact with the media, made the point that during his Commissionership, 
NI had some 42 per cent of the total United Kingdom newspaper readership.520 However, 
that reasoning does not necessarily explain the level of contact between Mr Fedorcio and the 
NoTW as an individual title within the NI stable, nor does it necessarily justify the nature and 
amount of the hospitality received.

4.24  Mr Fedorcio accepted that there was a commonality in the journalists that appeared within 
the gifts and hospitality register – namely Michael Sullivan, Stephen Wright, John Twomey and 
Lucy Panton.521 Mr Fedorcio attempted to explain this level of interaction with the individuals 
concerned by suggesting that:522 

“…  they  were  quite  active  in  covering  the  Metropolitan  Police,  following  lots  of 
different  angles  and  stories.  They  were  often  exploring  whether  –  you  know,  they 
were the sorts of stories that we would be interested in assisting them with.” 

4.25  That may well have been the case. However, I believe that Mr Fedorcio’s understanding of his 
role and remit as the Director of Public Affairs for the MPS became somewhat blurred over 
time, to the extent that a perception was created that he had become too close to certain 
journalists and particular news organisations. Mr Sullivan, for example, described how their 
“reasonably close working relationship forged over many years”523 meant that:524 

“… on occasions … he could be – not necessarily open up with any great personal 
detail on anyone, but talk about his concerns, I suppose, and use me in some ways, as 
I used him, as sounding boards”. 

The particular example given related to the difficulties with the media encountered by Lord 
Blair during his Commissionership.525 

4.26  Perhaps a more egregious example was provided by Mr Fedorcio himself. It related to his 
interaction with Ms Panton, formerly crime editor for the NoTW.526 Mr Fedorcio described 
how on most weeks he would speak to Ms Panton on the telephone about the stories the 
newspaper was planning to run the following Sunday. This contact would sometimes involve a

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGone-to-one meeting late in the week, often on a Friday afternoon.527 On the specific occasion 
in question, which took place in his office at Scotland Yard, Mr Fedorcio recalled that Ms 
Panton had arrived for one of their regular end of week meetings: 528

“…  with  a  story  about  the  reception  into  prison  of  ex-Commander  Ali  Dizaei  (in 
particular concerning his alleged refusal to hand over his suit to the prison staff).” 

Mr Fedorcio suggested that Ms Panton was:529

“… being chased by telephone and/or text by her office to file this story, which they 
were expecting from her. To help her, and as she was under pressure, I offered to let 
her type the story, which she did from notes that she arrived with, in an e-mail on the 
stand-alone computer in my office.” 

4.27  Mr Fedorcio stated that he saw a copy of the story at the time that this incident took place.530 
The story itself made reference to ‘a prison source’ and ‘insiders’531, which may at least have 
suggested that The NoTW had a source within the prison providing them with the information 
– Mr Fedorcio accepted “that is possible”,532 although Ms Panton denied it to be true; instead, 
she suggested that the information came from “another journalist.”533 Despite the uncertain 
provenance of the information contained within the article, Mr Fedorcio saw nothing in the 
story at the time to cause him concern, he said “not from a Metropolitan Police perspective, 
but I think for Commander Dizaei it would have been embarrassing.”534

4.28  Leaving aside for one moment whether it was appropriate for Mr Fedorcio to allow Ms Panton 
to use his computer to file a story, it might also be argued that the very nature of the article 
in question gives rise to a number of ethical considerations. As to this, Mr Fedorcio said:535

“… at the time, I recall thinking that I was helping someone who was being put under 
what I thought was quite unnecessary pressure, if not bullying, by her news desk, 
and – you know, to help her solve her problem. In return, from my perspective, I felt I 
was going to get sight of a story which I may not otherwise have sight of until Sunday 
morning. At the time, I had no idea what was in it, but of course, it enabled me then 
to consider the impact of that on the Metropolitan Police, if at all.”

4.29  For her part, Ms Panton described why the filing of the story was so urgent, even though the 
meeting with Mr Fedorcio took place on a Thursday afternoon and The NoTW did not go to 
press until Saturday evening:536

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“The – what we call “back of the book stories” – so those are stories that are not as 
explosive, exclusive, smaller stories – would often be put to bed and put on a page 
on  a  Friday,  and  this  would  probably  come  into  that  category.  Also,  news  editors 
would want to get their stories from their departments in the newspaper, so they’d 
want to go into conference in the morning knowing something about the story, as 
much as they could, to pitch it in conference … In the olden days, I think people used 
to knock on doors, strangers, random residents, to use telephones when they were 
under pressure. I think on this occasion … journalistic instinct took over and I did what 
it took to get the news desk off my back.” 

4.30  Ms Panton confirmed that once she had typed the story using Mr Fedorcio’s computer, she 
forwarded it to her own e-mail account, and using her Blackberry then forwarded it on to 
three individuals at the NoTW.537 Ms Panton’s covering e-mail to The NoTW read as follows:538 

“Had 2 use dicks computer 2 file and can’t seem 2 delete the original msg details. 
Would not be helpful 2 him for people 2 know I was using his office so pls delete that. 
Mfl.” 

4.31  Although Ms Panton asserted that it was not at his request,539 it is clear from her covering e-mail 
that she had formed the view that it would not be helpful for Mr Fedorcio for others to know 
that she had used his computer to draft and file a story. Given the perception this created, it is 
not difficult to understand why that might be the case. As to this, Ms Panton said:540 

“I wouldn’t know who they were sending it on to. That was where I was concerned, 
and although I’d just sent it to three people, when you file things it can go to any 
number of people within that office, who wouldn’t necessarily understand who he 
was or the situation of why I was filing from there.” 

4.32  Mr Fedorcio stated that the computer used was a stand-alone machine and was not connected 
to the MPS computer system,541 that the e-mail concerned was not retained on his system, 
saying “I deleted it almost immediately afterwards”.542 He was also clear that Ms Panton had 
had no access to any of his files or documents in writing the story and that he was:543 

“… keen to say to her that I wouldn’t want anyone to think that I had been the source 
of the story, which I wasn’t. She arrived with the notes on this when she came to see 
me.” 

However, the fact is that, by allowing Ms Panton the use of his computer to draft and file 
the story, this was an entirely accurate assessment of the position in which Mr Fedorcio had 
placed himself. 

4.33  Mr Fedorcio denied that this episode came as a result of his friendship with Ms Panton:544

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“I don’t think it resulted from my friendship. As I said earlier, I think I would have 
considered doing it for anybody who was in that set of circumstances, but I accept it 
may have been an error of judgment.” 

I can only agree with Mr Fedorcio’s assessment. Whatever his true motivation for allowing Ms 
Panton the use of his computer, and I am prepared to accept Mr Fedorcio’s explanation that 
it was done for purely benevolent reasons, this example did (and does) create a perception 
that an overly close and exclusive relationship existed between the two. This perception was 
heightened by the level and nature of some of the social interaction between the two.545 
Whatever  the  reality  of  the  relationship,  and  again  I  am  prepared  to  accept  that  their 
interaction was fundamentally professional in nature, it was difficult for Mr Fedorcio to rebut 
the suggestion that over time he had become beholden to Ms Panton. The creation of this 
perception of influence, as we have seen, clearly had an impact on the public’s confidence in 
the MPS, and the Police Service as a whole.

Links with News International

News of the World

4.34  Despite the apparently close relationship that existed between certain journalists employed 
by the NoTW and the MPS, it was suggested that in fact, the newspaper presented the DPA 
with more difficulties than other media outlets because of their sting operations. Mr Fedorcio 
said:546

“The News of the World was one of the most challenging media outlets to deal with 
because of the nature and content of their coverage, propensity for sting operations 
and their reluctance to approach the MPS with questions or requests for operational 
support until the last minute on a Saturday. This was fuelled by a lack of trust and the 
fear that their exclusive story would be undermined by premature police intervention 
or leaked to another media outlet. From an MPS perspective this was not a satisfactory 
situation. For example, if we received a telephone call at mid-Saturday afternoon, just 
ahead of the deadline for Sunday newspapers, then there was little or no time to 
provide input or properly planned support or intervention.”

4.35  Furthermore, Mr Fedorcio suggested that through his contact with the newspaper he had 

sought, over time, to:547

“… gain their confidence and trust to encourage them to work with us at a much 
earlier opportunity on their stories. It enabled me to make arrangements for timely 
access to relevant officers and put them on notice of what approaches we may be 
getting in due course. The positive effect of this can be seen in the case of the cricket 
match fixing story when the editor, Colin Myler, approached me at 6pm on a Friday 
evening, which gave us far more reasonable notice to put an effective policing plan in 
place the following day which ultimately led to successful prosecutions.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG4.36  The  occasional  difficulties  presented  by  the  NoTW  for  the  DPA  would  appear  to  have 
recognised  by  the  newspaper  itself.  Mr  Fedorcio  recalled  the  DPA  receiving  a  Christmas 
hamper  in  December  2003  from  the  then  editor  of  the  NoTW,  Andy  Coulson,  which  was 
shared  amongst  staff.  The  receipt  of  the  hamper  was  recorded  within  the  MPS’  gifts  and 
hospitality register.548 Mr Fedorcio explained why the gift had been made:549

“I think that it was a regular occurrence that the News of the World would come to 
the Metropolitan Police with a question about a story or stories they were running, 
at the last minute on a Saturday, and the Met was faced with either, in some cases, 
needing to put an operational response together, ie to find officers who may be able 
to respond to what they were putting to us, or we needed to find an answer to give 
them back again … So I think that in the main, we managed to just about respond to 
them. It often led, I think, to the News of the World getting their story but the Met not 
getting its man, if I can put it that way. The lateness of them coming to us meant that 
operationally we weren’t able to secure the sort of intelligence or evidence that we 
would need to pursue if a crime was being committed …”

4.37  Mr Fedorcio explained that as well as seeking a response to ‘sting’ type stories, the NoTW 

had also sought confirmation on facts relating to articles that they were planning to run:550 

“I think, like all papers, you may get a normal press Inquiry with: “We understand the 
following; can you comment?” That would have gone on in the normal run of things …” 

He also suggested that the NoTW, on occasions, published critical articles in relation to police 
officers:551

“I can point to a case during the Damilola Taylor case where the News of the World 
ran a very nasty story about the police officer who had been selected as the media 
spokesperson for that case, and as a result of his status as the media spokesperson, 
he became a celebrity in their mind and was therefore fair game for them to look into 
his private life. They didn’t pull punches.”

4.38  Ms Panton explained that the NoTW frequently carried out high profile investigations, the 
fruits of which were very often handed over to the police.552 Despite this, Ms Panton argued 
that it did not place the newspaper in a special position in relation to the police. She said:553 

“I  think  my  role  was  to  try  and  make  these  sting  operations  run  as  smoothly  as 
possible, and by having someone who was used to dealing with the police, I think the 
paper found it helpful and the police often did.” 

She also argued that there was no preferential treatment by the MPS towards the NoTW.554

4.39  Despite this assertion, there is no doubt that a very damaging perception was created that 
the NoTW exercised an inappropriate level of influence over the MPS. The appearance of

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGcloseness  or  “cosiness”  between  some  of  the  MPS’  senior  officers  and  staff  at  the  NoTW 
can  be  attributed  to  a  number  of  factors.  Elements  of  Mr  Fedorcio’s  interaction  with  Ms 
Panton, for example (and in contradistinction to the argument made by her above), give rise 
to the perception that the newspaper was being given preferential treatment. This legitimate 
concern was underscored by the level of formality and frequency of some the contact that 
existed between certain individuals in the MPS and the NoTW.

4.40  Undoubtedly  the  most  damaging  allegation  made  against  the  MPS  was  that  some  of  the 
relationships  in  question  actually  influenced  operational  decision  making,  and  whilst  I 
subsequently  make  clear  that  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  was  true,  it  is  easy  to 
see how such a perception was in fact created. By way of illustration, Mr Fedorcio’s social 
interaction with the NoTW continued whilst Operation Caryatid was taking place. He recalled, 
for example, meeting for lunch with the NoTW journalist Rebecca Mowley on 23 August 2006, 
just a few weeks after the arrest of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman.555 Mr Fedorcio confirmed 
that he had been aware of the arrests on the day that they had taken place but denied that 
any discussion in relation to Operation Caryatid had taken place. He said:556

“Not that I recall. I must admit, in all the interactions that I’ve had with News of the 
World, I don’t recall ever any discussion around phone hacking or those arrests.” 

4.41  However,  it  is  not  hard  to  see  how  an  alternative  conclusion  might  be  formed,  with  Mr 

Fedorcio himself now candidly admitting that:557 

“I think, looking at it now, one would question that and one would question a whole 
series of interactions over the following months and years …” 

This is by no means the only example of this type, and in subsequent sections I analyse in 
more detail some of the specific relationships and instances of concern that helped to create 
the perception described.

Neil Wallis

4.42  Neil Wallis was a central figure in the relationship between NI and the MPS. Mr Wallis joined 
The Sun as its Chief Investigative reporter in December 1986, and then progressed to be the 
features editor, news editor, associate editor and then deputy editor of the newspaper. In 
January 1998 he left The Sun to become editor of the People, and then in January 2003 he 
joined The NoTW as its deputy editor, a role he held until becoming the newspaper’s executive 
editor in early 2008. Mr Wallis resigned from the NoTW in June 2009.558 In describing the 
background to his contact with the MPS, Mr Wallis explained:559

“The  relationships  which  I  forged  over  a  number  of  years  with  the  senior  figures 
at  New  Scotland  Yard  were  established  by  me  in  my  capacity  as  an  experienced 
journalist who I believe was respected by those I knew at the highest levels for my 
insight, knowledge and judgment over a range of issues which essentially fit under 
the discipline of public relations.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGMoreover, he suggested that the relationships referred to were built up on the back of his 
reputation as a journalist:560 

“… I think the point being that it was a relationship built up not just at my time at the 
News of the World but before that at the people and before that at the Sun.” 

4.43  Mr Wallis asserted that his “good working relationships with senior officers at New Scotland 
Yard” dated back to the Commissionership of Lord Condon.561 He suggested that he had “got 
on well” with Lord Condon and explained that over the relevant period they had from time to 
time met in his office or on a “handful” of occasions for lunch or dinner.562 It is worth repeating 
in some detail the description provided by Mr Wallis of the nature of his conversations with 
Lord Condon:563 

“… What would happen is we would meet, we would have conversations, I’d give him 
my views, and if he found them interesting or if he found them useful, then I was glad. 
We talked on a number of issues. He had a number of issues going on at the time … 
he was trying to do two things at the same time in the Met. He was trying to end 
to end tenure, which was a very important thing in the Met, whereby effectively an 
officer would get a job and it was pretty much theirs for life. At the same time, he was 
tackling serious issues of corruption, and he believed there was a parallel – there may 
be a link between the two. He was in the midst of trying to bring an end to tenure, 
with the knock-on effect of helping disrupt corruption, and this was being met with a 
pretty strong dirty tricks campaign amongst certain elements of the police who didn’t 
want it. 

He had particular problems, I remember, with the Flying Squad at – I think it was 
called Rigg Approach or somewhere like that. So we would talk about those issues, 
and as a result of that, one of the things I said to him was: “You should come out with 
it. You should tell London. You should tell Britain how big a problem this is, that it’s 
not just you sort of tinkering around for financial reasons, that there is a problem.” 
So we did a very big set piece, exclusive interview, me on him, in his office, that was 
a splash and spread in the Sun, followed up BBC, Guardian et cetera, places like that, 
that spelt out the fact that … they feared they had 2-300 corrupt officers in the Met 
and he was determined to root it out. And so it was a big PR campaign for him. He 
was  setting  his  stall  out  to  the  nation  but  also  to  the  corrupt  officers  and  also  to 
the sort of local government in London, to say, “This is a big problem. It isn’t minor 
tinkering, as it’s been led to suggest; it is serious.” 

4.44  Mr Wallis suggested that in giving his advice to Lord Condon “I had an opinion how he could 
make something  that was very important to him  accessible  to the Great British  public”,564 
although  he  could  not  remember  whether  his  advice  was  requested  or  provided  on  an 
unsolicited basis:565

“I couldn’t tell you how it came about … He wouldn’t talk about specifics ever, of

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGcourse, but … he was talking to someone who represented the biggest daily newspaper 
in the country and then, later, the editor of another major circulation tabloid – he was 
interested in my views. Chicken or egg, I have no idea.” 

4.45  Mr Wallis’ relationship with Lord Condon was not simply one way, and he explained what he 

was seeking to gain from this type of informal interaction:566

“This was a sort of corporate/strategic relationship. It wasn’t about trying to get a 
quick hit at a story. For instance, I think one of the things I mentioned elsewhere is the 
Police Bravery Awards. The Police Bravery Awards, which I happen to think is a great 
thing, got off the ground because of Sir Paul Condon. We, as the Sun, were a feisty, 
controversial organisation. We were quite happy to take a whack at anybody and we 
were seen in that way. We were trying to reach out to the police establishment, if 
you like, and to make them go along with an idea and it was going to be a struggle. 
Because of our relationship with Sir Paul, who realised that there may be more to us 
than simply the tabloid cliché, he became willing to back it and said, “Come what may, 
the Met will support this.” I was then able to go to the head of the Police Federation, 
who also had a good trusting relationship with Sir Paul, and together, as a result of 
that, we were able to jointly go around the rest of the forces of Britain to say, Sir Paul 
and the Met are backing this. Why don’t you? If you need to, have a conversation 
with the Met about why they’re backing it.” And as a result, something is still going I 
think 14, 16 years later.” 

4.46  Mr Wallis agreed therefore that this was a long-term strategy on his part, and not one that 
would  necessarily  produce  an  immediate  return  in  terms  of  stories  or  exclusives  for  his 
newspaper. He said:567 

“… Now, let’s be correct about it: if they sat there and said, ‘Oh, incidentally, such-
and-such a thing, do you want to know that or do you want that?’ then on occasions 
I daresay that might have happened. I don’t remember any, but the relationship was 
about a strategic relationship.” 

4.47  This long-term strategy continued through his relationship with Lord Stevens. Mr Wallis told 
the Inquiry that he had first met Lord Stevens in his capacity as Deputy Commissioner of the 
MPS, having being introduced to him by Mr Fedorcio.568 He suggested that the relationship 
was fostered in much the same way as his relationship with Lord Condon had been:569

“… I mean, initially, but as time developed, it became a more active relationship than 
it did with Sir Paul Condon, but it would be over meals, phone calls, occasional drink.” 

4.48  Mr Wallis stated that through his contact with Lord Stevens he became aware of his intention 
to apply for the post of Commissioner of the MPS.570 Furthermore, he suggested that, in his 
view, Lord Stevens had been “the best candidate of the candidates I was aware of”,571 and

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGso had advised him throughout the application and interview process.572 As to how this had 
taken place, he said:573

“In the same way as I talked about before with Sir Paul Condon, we would be talking, 
and if an issue came up, we would discuss it and I would give him my view. I had, 
it is fair to say, quite strong views about what was happening at the Met. I cared 
about the Met a lot. The MacPherson report was pretty catastrophic for the Met, 
and whoever succeeded Sir Paul Condon, it was going to be a very, very important 
appointment for the Met. As Joe Citizen, never mind as a journalist, I had quite strong 
views about it.” 

4.49  Mr  Wallis  candidly  admitted  that  his  support  for  Lord  Stevens’  candidacy  for  the  post  of 

Commissioner had not been simple altruism on his part:574

“… What I knew about John Stevens was that he had a view about how police and 
press should interact. He had a strong view that was based, at least in part, on his 
experiences  in  Ireland  –  which  I  knew  a  lot  about,  because  I’d  served  there  –  his 
experiences in Northumbria – which, again, I knew about because I’ve lived there – 
and also because of what we had seen with Sir Paul Condon, MacPherson, et cetera, 
et cetera, and the relationship between the press and the Metropolitan Police. He had 
a view that (a) I agreed with and (b) was also convenient for him and was also good 
for newspapers. So, if you like, the opposite of a perfect storm. A perfect sunburst.”

4.50  Despite this convergence of views, Mr Wallis denied that he had enjoyed a fast-track to the 

office of the Commissioner:575 

“… What happened was that this was a guy who was going for it. I gave him some 
input.  He  succeeded.  I  thought,  “Happy  days,  because  this  has  worked  out  all 
right  and  hopefully  there  will  be  a  better  moving  forward  way  for  the  media  and 
the Metropolitan Police.” That benefited my newspaper, so it was good all round. I 
similarly felt, at the time, that there was a better relationship we were working on, 
for instance, at the Home Office. All right? I didn’t necessarily think that that was of 
instant benefit to me. I got on with Alastair Campbell. It wasn’t just a benefit to me 
that … you were able to talk to Alastair Campbell in the press, if you see what I mean. 
All I’m saying is my life is not about the MPS.” 

4.51  Mr Wallis also stressed that throughout the period of Lord Stevens’ Commissionership he had 
not sought to influence his “individual decision making process, rather it was a case of him 
asking me how certain options would be perceived by the general public.”576 He said that his 
role of informal advisor to Lord Stevens “grew like Topsy” and continued “throughout his time 
as the Commissioner” over lunches, dinners and by telephone.577

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG4.52  When dining or meeting for drinks, Mr Wallis stated that he:578 

“… would pay the bill on each occasion which I would reclaim via an expenses claim, 
where appropriate, from News International from time to time, with the assistance 
of my PA.” 

According to Mr Wallis, the level of contact varied depending on what was happening at the 
time so that it could be “every week, every month, twice a day. It just varied”.579 The advice 
offered was on an unpaid basis, with Mr Wallis suggesting that he:580 

“… very much regarded it as part of my duties as the Deputy Editor of the News of 
the World to forge and maintain relations with senior police officers in the interests 
of my readership.”

4.53  Despite his apparently frequent contact with Lord Stevens, Mr Wallis was clear that he saw 
no conflict between his role in reporting objectively about the police on the one hand, and 
his informal advice-giving role on the other. He said:581

“… you know, journalism and newspapers are like lawyers. You know … they can be 
talking to someone and have a view, but it doesn’t mean to say that they then don’t 
have a different conversation with somebody else, you know, depending on which 
side hired you. So I would have a personal view and I would say to whoever I was 
talking to: “I think this.” If a hoofing great story came along that wasn’t convenient 
to that, first and foremost I’m a journalist and the hoofing great story went in the 
paper.” 

4.54  The long-term benefits of Mr Wallis’ enduring relationship with Lord Stevens and the MPS 
would  appear  to  have  manifested  themselves  in  a  number  of  different  ways.  Mr  Wallis 
suggested, for example, that on occasions his conversations with Lord Stevens would lead to 
a specific story for his newspaper:582 

“If he wanted and I was interested – because that’s one of the other things that comes 
into this, of course. Let’s be real. I worked for tabloid newspapers. Quite a lot of police 
policy, et cetera, et cetera, is simply not of interest to tabloid newspapers. Now, one 
of the things I would attempt to do was to find a way to make that accessible if it was 
relevant, but occasionally he might have a view about something that might make a 
story or a feature or whatever.” 

4.55  His evidence also suggested a degree of enhanced access to senior officers within the MPS. 

He said:583

“… One of the benefits of my relationship, without question, with senior police officers 
is that if I rang – and it would always be via Dick Fedorcio, but if I rang one of them 
and said, “We have this situation that we think the Met ought to get involved with”,

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthen they would take that seriously, because they know that I’m a guy who is not 
going to mess them about …” 

4.56  This may all hint at an inappropriately exclusive relationship. Certainly one can well understand 
why the fostering of such a relationship with the MPS would be of significant benefit to Mr 
Wallis and the newspapers for which he worked. His evidence rather hinted at this aim when 
he said of his relationship with Lord Stevens:584 

“I’d  rather  hope  he  was  more  friendly  to  me  than  anybody  else,  but  in  honesty,  I 
haven’t a clue. I mean, when you look at his hospitality register, as far as I can see, he 
wasn’t mean in his charms, as it were. I know he got on very well, for instance, with 
Paul Dacre.” 

4.57  As to the reality, Lord Stevens described his relationship with Mr Wallis in these terms:585 

“It was totally professional. I never went to his house, he never came to mine or to my 
flat. It was all on a professional basis, and that’s how I wanted it to be and that’s how 
it was with all of the people involved in the press.” 

Mr Wallis endorsed that description.586

4.58  With reference to his diary, Lord Stevens also commented on some of his social interaction 
with  Mr  Wallis.  His  diary  recorded,  for  example,  a  meal  with  Mr  Wallis  at  the  Birdcage 
restaurant in January 2000. As to this, Lord Stevens said:587

“… I met Mr Wallis twice, with my wife and his wife, when we were working up the 
charity I was basically in charge of, which was Convoy 2000, to involve his wife. We 
met twice. He paid for the dinner once and I paid for the other dinner, but that didn’t 
come to anything …” 

4.59  His diary also recorded a lunch with Mr Wallis and Lord Waheed Alli in October 2000, and 
then subsequently a meeting at New Scotland Yard in November 2000 with the same two 
individuals. He described the purpose of those encounters:588 

“… Neil Wallis was a friend of Lord Alli, Waheed Alli. I wanted Waheed Alli to be an 
adviser – a group of about 12 or 14 people, and I wanted him to be one, to be advisors, 
to actually say what we were doing wrong, in particular what the Metropolitan Police 
was doing wrong, what I was doing wrong, and what we could do to right that. So 
there were two meetings with Lord Alli and he then agreed to be one of the advisers 
who I used to meet up with once every three to four months for dinner at Scotland 
Yard.” 

4.60  For his part, Mr Wallis suggested that this example provided an illustration of the benefits of 
his informal advisory role, given that his introduction of Lord Alli to Lord Stevens provided

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGthe latter with a “more diverse audience and pool of ideas than he had been accessing up to 
that point.”589 

4.61  Lord Stevens’ relationship with Mr Wallis continued beyond his tenure with the MPS. Shortly 
after  his  retirement  in  February  2005,  Lord  Stevens  described  how  he  decided  to  write  a 
number of articles for the NoTW. This was part of a package which was negotiated around 
his  autobiography, ‘Not for the Faint Hearted’, which  was serialised  in  The Times  and  the 
NoTW.590 Lord Stevens said:591

“… I was approached by Lord Weidenfeld, who talked me into it. Other Commissioners 
had written autobiographies and I wanted to model my autobiography on Sir Robert 
Marks’ “In the Office of Constable”. Part of the deal was that that would be serialised 
in  the  News  of  the  World  and  the  Times  and  that  was  part  of  the  package.  The 
proceeds of that were going to go towards officers attending Northumbria University, 
where I’m chancellor, who had not been to university, who did not have a degree or 
university education … So that was the process. The question writing articles was part 
of the package that the book involved, and it was writing no more than seven articles 
in a year, which were police-related, and being paid £5,000 per article, which was a 
vast sum of money as far as I was concerned, but that, I was told, was the going rate, 
and Jeremy Lee of JLA, who was acting on my behalf in relation to these matters, 
dealt with that.”

4.62 

In  respect  of  the  NoTW  serialisation,  Lord  Stevens  was  clear  that  Mr  Wallis  had  nothing 
whatsoever to do with the contract itself, he said:592 

“… that was dealt with by Mr [Kuttner], who was the managing director of the News 
of the World and the Times. So they were dealt with by separate people, and Neil 
Wallis wasn’t involved in that.” 

Lord Stevens was also clear that it was the publishers who arranged the particular titles where 
his articles would be serialised.593 

4.63  The  articles  themselves  went  under  the  title  “The  Chief”.594  They  were  ghost-written  and 
edited by Mr Wallis being “based on major policing issues that arose during 2005-2006, such 
as the 7/7 bombings and the shooting of PC Sharon Beshenivsky.”595 Lord Stevens said that 
in writing the articles he had been expressing a personal view on the matters at issue.596 He 
said:597 

“The theme was really about how difficult the policing task is in terms of what they 
do. I had the idea – it might have been naively – that no longer having the constraints

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGof being Commissioner, I could talk about things in a far more open manner in terms 
of what the police do and the excellent work that they do in terms of terrorism …”

4.64  Although not involved in the contract negotiations, Mr Wallis confirmed that it was through 
his contact with Lord Stevens that the NoTW had first become aware that an autobiography 
was being written,598 and that furthermore, on receipt of that information, he had indicated 
to Lord Stevens that the NoTW would be “very interested” in serialising the book.599 Mr Wallis 
suggested that this, together with “The Chief” articles, were examples or by-products of his 
relationship with Lord Stevens, a relationship built up over a considerable period of time.600 
Mr Wallis explained that he had chosen the subject matter for “The Chief” articles and:601 

“… wrote them so that they would be a great read for the News of the World readers, 
that would gather interest from other media organisations and would be completely 
compatible with how he thought or what he believed. So it was, again, you know, a 
synthesis of coming together of interests.” 

4.65  Mr Wallis also elaborated on the editing process in these terms:602

“… ghosted articles in newspapers have been going for as long as Mr Caxton was 
here. It was a perfectly common thing and I wouldn’t want you to think that I would 
just write a piece and lob it in the paper. What would happen was I would have a view, 
I would speak to John Stevens, we would work out the structure of the article, I would 
write the article, I would email it to him or fax it to him, he would come back to me 
and say, “I like this, I don’t want to do that, I want to change this”, I would do it again, 
I would send it back to him, he would say, “Okay”, I would send it to the back bench, 
the back bench would subedit it, I would get the subediting version – because plainly, 
you’re going to write about 1,000 words which are going to come down to about 800 
words, say. I would then check that I was happy with the subediting. I would send 
that back to John for his final say-so before it was put in the paper, including the 
headlines.”

4.66  Lord Stevens terminated the contract with the NoTW in October 2007, explaining that he had 

had no further dealings with Mr Wallis or the newspaper since then.603 He said: 604

“… I didn’t complete that contract because of the conviction that took place of the 
two people in the News of the World, and I saw Colin Myler and Neil Wallis and told 
them I didn’t want to continue. I never gave them specific reasons, but from that 
night on, I never saw them again … when the convictions were taking place, certain 
other information was coming to my ears which just – I didn’t just want to do it.”

4.67  As to his original rationale for writing the articles, Lord Stevens suggested that: 605 

“It did not seem like an unusual step to take at the time and I was aware that countless

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGpoliticians had done exactly the same thing. It gave me the opportunity to promote 
policing and talk about the difficulties MPS police officers and staff had to deal with.” 

With respect to Lord Stevens, I am not sure that the roles of Commissioner and politician 
should be viewed as being particularly analogous in this context. Public confidence in the 
police is a critical element in the concept of policing by consent, and therefore there is a risk, 
and I put it no higher than that, that public media commentary on police matters by a former 
senior officer may undermine the authority of those presently in command and that may be 
contrary to the public interest. This is an important issue, and one to which I will return in 
greater detail later in this Section of the Report. 

4.68  At least from Mr Wallis’ perspective, the articles under the banner “The Chief” would not 
appear to have been designed as a completely neutral, benign and objective commentary 
on the Police Service. As well as choosing the subject matter and ghost-writing the articles, 
Mr Wallis confirmed that he had also played a part in the naming of the column.606 Although 
Mr Wallis denied it to be true,607 it could certainly be argued that the title of the column was 
deliberately provocative. Mr Wallis himself suggested that Lord Blair, Commissioner of the 
MPS during the period that the articles appeared in the NoTW, had been unhappy that his 
predecessor was featuring in the column, he said:608

“There was a bit of gossip about it. It had been around, may have even been in a 
gossip column. But when we actually met him – I was trying to recollect how this 
happened, but one day he ended up in our office. I think he may have been visiting 
another newspaper and had been invited, if you like, by whoever was accompanying 
him, to do a tour of the building, and he ended up on our floor … But he came in and 
it came up in conversation and he said, “I don’t know how you can call him the chief 
– he’s not the chief any more; I am”, which was vaguely funny, I thought.” 

4.69  Mr Wallis conceded that Lord Blair’s displeasure was not in the least bit surprising, and perhaps 
tellingly in this regard said “mischief is a significant component of newspapers, particularly 
tabloid newspapers”.609 In fairness to Lord Stevens, in hindsight, he recognised that this was a 
contract that he should not have entered into in the first place. He said:610 

“I think knowing what I do now, I certainly wouldn’t have entered into it, and that’s a 
fact. By terminated [sic] the contract with five more articles to write, I was throwing 
away money, but that didn’t worry me.” 

4.70  As  may  now  be  obvious,  the  relationship  between  Mr  Wallis  and  Lord  Blair  was  in  stark 
contrast to his interaction with the previous incumbents in the role of Commissioner, Lord 
Condon and Lord Stevens. Mr Wallis said of Lord Blair:611

“I did not really know Ian Blair. He made absolutely no effort to forge any relationship 
with me or anyone else at the News of the World or to my knowledge any other mass 
market editor or deputy editor at the time on Fleet Street.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGIt is of interest that, in describing his relationship with Lord Blair, Mr Wallis also suggested 
that:612 

“… he took a different view from John Stevens. He decided that he wasn’t interested 
in the views of either the tabloid or mid-market press. He was a very cerebral man. 
He saw himself very much as somebody who didn’t want to pursue those sorts of 
contacts, so, you know, he didn’t.” 

4.71  Mr Wallis’ analysis of Lord Blair’s attitude towards the press would appear to have mandated 
their relationship. He went further by suggesting that Lord Blair’s apparent failure to establish 
good relationships with senior editorial figures in the press was partly responsible for the 
generally  negative  coverage  he  received  as  Commissioner  of  the  MPS.613  If  true,  this  may 
inevitably lead the Commissioner of the day, or other senior police figures, to the conclusion 
that they must have a very open and receptive relationship with the media to ensure that the 
coverage of them personally, and their forces, is fair and balanced. Mr Wallis denied this to 
be the case, and said: 614

“… anybody who ever thinks they have a sort of free pass from the press is fooling 
themselves. It’s a symbiotic relationship, but it is one that always can go both ways. 
So Ian Blair couldn’t have rescued himself with the press simply by buying us drinks 
and being friendly. What he needed was some good advice to say, “Look, this is an 
issue. This is what you need to do about the issue. If you got that wrong, don’t be 
self-justifying about it. Face up to it. This is how you should face up to it. These are 
some PR leads, if you like. These are some attitudes you could strike. These are some 
things you could do to try to repair that damage.” One of those, without doubt, would 
be sitting down with – whether it’s Paul Dacre, Ian McGregor at the Telegraph, Andy 
Coulson or Colin Myler at the News of the World, and explaining to them where he 
was coming from, what his thoughts were, and taking their view about, you know, 
what he was doing that – you know, in a way, newspapers have constituencies, you 
know? The Sun has a distinct constituency. So when its editor speaks, it’s telling you 
what the perception is – the editor’s perception of what the constituency thinks. So 
what you can take out of it is if I want to reach out to that constituency, then I need 
to take this, that or the other into account.” 

4.72  There  is  an  element  of  circularity  to  Mr  Wallis’  argument  and  it  is  perhaps  unsurprising 
that Sir Paul Stephenson said this when describing his approach to the media on becoming 
Commissioner of the MPS:615 

“… It was quite clear that during my predecessor’s term of office, Sir Ian Blair, now 
Lord Blair, that there was a good deal of commentary in the media, and much of 
it  negative.  My  belief  was  that  that  reflected  quite  poorly  and  unfairly  on  the 
Metropolitan Police Service and indeed on Sir Ian Blair, Lord Blair now, himself. Not 
only that; it was extremely distracting to senior officers, constantly having to deal 
with this sort of list of headlines, much of which I felt were unfair at the time, which 
actually distracted us from what should be the main purpose of the Met, which really 
is about doing the job we’re supposed to be doing on behalf of Londoners, and I came 
to a very strong view that what we needed to have in our relationship with the media

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGis to try and effect the situation where the story was much more about what we do 
and less about who we were as senior officers, and that was something reflected to 
me when I met many junior officers when I took up office.” 

4.73  Sir Paul would appear to have succeeded from Mr Wallis’ perspective. The latter described 
his relationship with Sir Paul as following “the same blueprint as my relationship with Sir John 
Stevens.”616 The extent to which this may or may not have been true is analysed below.

4.74  Although it is not something from which it is necessarily possible to draw any firm conclusions, 
it is certainly the case, as Mr Wallis himself confirmed, that the pattern of the relationship 
between the police and the newspapers for which Mr Wallis worked was generally one of 
convergence. He said: “I think that it is absolutely true, that for many years I have been lucky 
enough to have my newspaper’s interest and the Metropolitan Police’s interests on occasion 
converge to our mutual benefit …”617 This is not of course to say that from time to time critical 
pieces were not written, as can be evidenced, for example, from some of the stories that 
appeared during Lord Blair’s period as Commissioner.618 However, Mr Wallis agreed that the 
usual approach was one that tended to be pro-police:619

“… I think that’s true. I worked for the Sun and then I went to … edit the left of centre 
Sunday People, but it’s essentially a populist approach, really. Believe it or not, most 
people out there do support the police and the Army, and so it seemed to me that it’s 
very often that those interests converge.” 

4.75  Mr  Wallis’  most  enduring  relationship  with  any  of  the  senior  figures  at  the  MPS  was  Mr 
Fedorcio. Mr Fedorcio confirmed that they had known each other since 1997, having first met 
at a dinner in the December of that year in the presence of Lord Condon and Stuart Higgins, 
then  Editor  of  The  Sun.620  Mr  Wallis  explained  that  in  Mr  Fedorcio’s  capacity  as  the  MPS’ 
Director of Public Affairs, he would “speak to him on the phone on a frequent basis, often 
with weekly frequency” and he would meet him for “dinner or a drink about six times every 
year.”621 Mr Wallis suggested that he had enjoyed a “good relationship” with Mr Fedorcio, 
and that on occasions he had provided him with public-relations or media advice. He said:622

“… I remember two examples of that. Once, going back to a Condon era, when there 
was a bombing at Canary Wharf and – I was editing the Sun at the time and there 
was going to be a press conference on the Sunday and I heard from our reporters 
when this was going to be, and it was – I think something like a February. And I rank 
[sic] the press office and said, “Look, the light is failing … the most dramatic thing 
about this in your PR terms are going to be the amazing pictures, so bring it forward 
an hour, do the photo-shoot before you do the press conference, and then you will get 
a bigger show in all the newspapers.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGAfter the 7/7 bombings, I had a very similar conversation with Dick Fedorcio about 
getting footage or getting stills from inside the tunnels of where the explosions had 
been, because I knew that they would be the best pictures and I knew they would 
dominate all the front pages and therefore that what the Met would get was what it 
needed, was those harrowing images, and it was sort of giving Dick the support to be 
able to go on to whoever he needed to speak to to try to get those pictures and that 
footage, and it worked.” 

4.76  Taking the level of Mr Wallis’ apparent assistance to the MPS on public-relations and media 
matters as a whole, some might conclude that the Director of Public Affairs, and the MPS more 
generally, were not particularly competent in this area, and therefore for his own professional 
and strategic reasons, Mr Wallis was filling a gap. As to this, Mr Wallis said:623 

“Well, I contributed where I felt that it was worth contributing and it was up to them 
what they took out of it.” 

Certainly it would appear once again that the advice provided by Mr Wallis to Mr Fedorcio 
was not simple altruism on his part. Their relationship would appear to have provided Mr 
Wallis with access to the very senior echelons of the MPS. By way of example, he said:624 

“I didn’t really often want to speak to anybody, because that wasn’t my sort of role, 
but certainly, for instance, I would go to Dick and say, “Look, we are instituting the 
Police Bravery Awards. It would be a big help to us if John Stevens would agree to be 
on the judging panel”, and so we got: “Yes, thanks very much.” 

4.77  Mr Wallis also described a sting operation in which the NoTW were seeking to set up someone 
whom they believed to be a paedophile and had asked for Mr Fedorcio’s assistance, which he 
provided. He said: 625

“… I remember there was an occasion where we had a paedophile investigation and it 
had nothing to do with me, but for some reason – and usually the Met are brilliant on 
these things, I have to stress but for some reason, on that Saturday we had this sting 
about to happen with a paedophile who thought he was going to pick up a 12-year-
old girl and we weren’t getting any help locally. So what I would have done in that 
circumstance is ring Dick and say, “Look, we’re about to do this. We’re not getting any 
reaction from whoever it is we’ve spoken to. I think it’s worth it for the Met.” And if 
he did or he didn’t, then we did get the help on that situation and a man ended up in 
jail for trying to groom a 12-year-old child as a paedophile.”

4.78  Despite the apparent closeness of Mr Wallis to some of the senior figures at the MPS, he said 

that:626 

“With the exception of the very occasional odd exclusive interview given to the News 
of the World by Sir Paul Condon and Sir John Stevens I was not provided with any 
information as a result of my relationship with these officers which they did not seek 
to be published. I was never provided with information from them which they were 
not authorised to divulge.” 

In un-packing this statement, Mr Wallis acknowledged that at times he had been provided

874

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGwith off-the-record information in the recognition that it would not be published save with 
the express agreement of the person providing it,627 and that this had taken place because, in 
his own words, “we had a relationship of trust”.628 

4.79  The receipt of this background information enabled Mr Wallis to gain a better understanding 
of how the police worked, or as he put it “I felt I was well briefed, yes, inasmuch as whatever 
they  chose  to  brief  me  about.”629  It  might  be  argued  that  the  receipt  of  this  sometimes 
privileged information was the entire purpose of Mr Wallis’ carefully crafted relationships 
with a number of very senior police officers and staff. As to this, he said:630

“I’m a journalist. You know, journalists live or die by their contacts. I was a very senior 
journalist. I had good relationships with people that enabled us both to benefit out of 
it. And, yes, I nurtured those contacts because that’s what journalists do. Incidentally, 
there is just one point – you know, there seems to be almost a presumption that it’s 
somehow wrong, the idea that people like senior journalists should not have access 
to senior opinion-formers. Well, you know, I don’t think I agree with that … you could 
take the view that … it’s actually quite important to a free press that people can – you 
know, a senior journalist can sit down and have off-the-record conversations with 
a whole variety of people, whether they be judges, whether they be police officers, 
whether they be politicians. I have done all of those things. All of those three things 
I’ve just said, I have done, and I think that’s a pretty healthy way to look at the idea 
of a democracy and a free press, frankly.”

4.80  Perhaps the most powerful illustration of what Mr Wallis described as his mutually beneficial 
relationship with the MPS was his procurement of the exclusive footage of what impact the 
‘shoe-bomb’  would  have  had  if  it  had  exploded  in  2001.631  Andy  Hayman,  formerly  ACSO 
within the MPS, recalled this example as being one that “epitomises the relationship” with 
the NoTW.632 He suggested that he had attended a meeting at the NoTW offices to:633 

“… ask the newspaper to show on their internet site a reconstruction of what could 
have been achieved by the airline plotters in blowing up an aircraft. I was accompanied 
at this meeting by Dick Fedorcio, the Director of DPA. It led to the newspaper agreeing 
to put the reconstruction video on their website, allowing members of the public to 
access it. It was promoted within the body of an article which they ran inside the 
newspaper.” 

4.81  Mr Wallis’ recollection was that the idea came from him, not Mr Hayman. He said:634 

“I can recall on one occasion in late 2005 that I was instrumental in the release of 
footage which was broadcast on the News of the World website of the effect that 
the “show bomb” which failed to detonate would have had in the event of it being 
successful. I was persistent with my advice to Hayman that this footage would have

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGa profound affect if released into the public domain as a result of which he provided 
to the News of the World.” 

4.82  This would also appear therefore to be an example of the nurturing of a contact by Mr Wallis, 

in this case, Mr Hayman. He explained:635

“I think it is an example of how I had spent X number of months where I would talk and 
whatever with him about a variety of things. My crime reporter, Lucy Panton – crime 
editor, Lucy Panton, I was talking to her one day about police issues, as I quite often 
would do if I was passing her desk. I would sit on it and chat, and she told me that 
Andy had mentioned to her this DVD, this video, because he’d said … something to her 
like: “If only people could really see what damage a shoe bomb could do”, because 
there was a little bit of – not scepticism in the world, but: “A shoe bomb? What could 
that do?” So I said to her: “Ask him if we can actually come and see it so we can see 
whether it would be worth producing.” So he said yes, so we went to see it. It was 
staggering. I said to him: “In my view, you really should put this out. I’d like you to do 
it through us.” He said, “You could get some video grabs.” I said, “Yes, we could get 
some video grabs, but one of the things we could do is put it on our website – put it 
openly on our website, and it will go viral worldwide.” So he then thought about it for 
a few days, came in to see Andy Coulson, the editor, showed it to Andy Coulson, and 
we did all of those things and it went round the world and is being shown to this day.”

4.83  Mr Wallis explained that it had not occurred to Mr Hayman that this was an exclusive or that 

he had thought:636 

“Oh, where can I place this? I know, I’ll go to the News of the World.” He mentioned 
it in passing to Lucy. Lucy then mentioned it in passing to me. I thought that would 
have two things: (a) it would be interesting for my newspaper, but (b) it was also a 
very good piece of PR for the Met.” 

Given the clear national  public  interest of  this  video, there is  a question  as to  whether it 
was appropriate or sensible for it to have been offered by the MPS to one newspaper alone. 
However, Mr Wallis argued that:637 

“This was an asset they didn’t know they had. It hadn’t occurred to them that this was 
worth putting out. It was mentioned to me, so I went and pursued it and suggested to 
them that they release it to us. If I hadn’t have made that pursuit, it would not have 
been released because it didn’t occur to them.” 

4.84  Certainly no criticism can be levelled at Mr Wallis or his newspaper in this instance; he was 
simply utilising his carefully built relationship with the MPS to procure an exclusive story. I 
have already addressed the relationship of trust that exists between the police and the press 
elsewhere,638 an important part of which is the police’s respect for exclusives, and Mr Wallis 
argued that the principle applied in this instance:639

“… This was not an asset that they saw as a PR asset. I, as a journalist, saw that I 
could turn it into a PR asset and therefore it was no different, I guess, than from me 
going to them and saying, “We have a story about X or Y or Z”, and them then putting

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGit out to everybody. It wouldn’t have been published in any way if it hadn’t have been 
my newspaper’s idea.”

4.85 

It  could  be  argued  that  this  was  qualitatively  different  from  the  hypothetical  situation 
where the MPS, appreciating the importance to the public of such a video and its value to a 
particular newspaper, had offered it for exclusive publication. The line, however, is a very fine 
one. This example certainly adds to the perception that the NoTW, and NI more generally, 
were provided with more favourable access to police information. It again also points to an 
apparent gap in the media expertise of the DPA and the MPS, whose failure to recognise 
the potential importance in public interest terms of this footage was surprising to say the 
least. Ed Stearns, Head of Media for the renamed Directorate of Media and Communication, 
appeared to have recognised this point. He said:640

“That was before my time in the directorate, but I’d absolutely hope that … if I was 
aware of that footage, that I would have thought about the possibility of putting it 
out into the public domain because it was something that might be of use to show 
the damage  that  that  bomb  may  have caused, and  it’s  certainly  something  that  I 
would like to consider in my role if that had come across my desk. I’m not sure if the 
directorate  knew  with  that  footage,  or  at  what  stage  they  did,  but  certainly  that 
would be something that I would at least consider and perhaps challenge officers on 
the possibility of getting that out there into the public domain.” 

4.86  This  example  would  appear  to  have  been  another  demonstration  of  the  convergence  in 

interests of the police and Mr Wallis, who said:641 

“The  upshot  of  us  publishing  it  was  that  video  appeared  in  other  newspapers,  on 
television, and went around the world. It was a rather good idea … We both won.” 

That may have been true in this instance, but was this all simply part of a long term-strategy to 
place himself at the heart of the MPS? The following exchange with Mr Wallis was important 
in this regard:642

“Q.  If  you  were  to  stand  back  from  all  of  this  and  you  were  to  take  into  account 
the  hospitality,  all  the  phone  calls  with  different  commissioners  and  assistant 
commissioners, writing of these articles, would you agree that it might be said to be 
part of an over-arching strategy to place the News of the World in a special position 
with the Metropolitan Police Service?

A. I think it is an example of how journalism worked well to our mutual benefit.

Q. That’s a bit of a non-committal answer. I wouldn’t want to flatter you too much, 
Mr Wallis, but if the implication is that you’re rather good at your job in this respect, 
surely you would agree that that’s what you were, in fact, trying to do: using your 
skills,  all  of  your  skills  –  and  we’ve  heard  the  full  range  of  them  –  to  achieve  for 
the News of the World a special relationship with the Metropolitan Police Service? 
Although you may not like the sharp way in which that was put, that’s what you were 
trying to do, wasn’t it?

A. In a way, but the problem is if I say yes, then it sounds too crude again. I mean, 
I was – plainly, I am a journalist. My job is journalism and, yes, I work with people,

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGbut this relationship that lasted from 1998 through – right, and with other people 
for  different  lengths  of  time  –  worked  because  it  was  a  good,  balanced,  trusting 
relationship that both sides felt they got stuff out of.” 

4.87  The fact that Mr Wallis was seeking to place himself in a special position with the MPS is 
unsurprising, given the obvious potential benefits to him and to the newspapers for which he 
worked. Those benefits, at the very least, would appear to have taken the form of privileged 
background  information  which  aided  Mr  Wallis’  understanding  of  the  MPS  and  helped  to 
contribute to stories that appeared within his newspapers.643 The fact that Mr Wallis carefully 
built relationships with some of the most senior figures at the MPS is not something for which 
he should be criticised; many will argue that he was simply a very effective journalist. From 
the perspective of the MPS, however, and looking forward to the future, it should ensure 
that its relationship with the media, in general, and individual journalists in particular, is kept 
within appropriate bounds and completely transparent to all. 

Chamy Media Ltd

4.88  The  relationship  that  Mr Wallis  had  with  the  MPS  continued  beyond  his  resignation  from 
the NoTW in June 2009. The background to the use of Chamy Media Ltd by the MPS starts 
with the fact that, from spring 2009 onwards, Mr Fedorcio had been considering whether he 
needed to engage some external support due to the long term illness of his deputy director, 
who had been on sick leave since mid-February 2009.644 The issue was then formally raised 
during Mr Fedorcio’s appraisal process, he said:645

“I remember some sort of previous interactions with the Commissioner during my 
internal appraisal. The Commissioner in there asked how I was coping wouldn’t [sic] 
a deputy in place, whether I needed any additional support, and at that stage I said 
it was my aim not to do it, in the hope that he would return shortly. The issue arose 
again when I had the second stage of that appraisal with the Commissioner and the 
chairman of the police authority, and again it was my view that I would try and cope 
without the deputy. The trigger, I suppose, to act on this was that probably about the 
third week of August, my deputy found that the treatment had not been successful 
and was therefore now going to have to undergo further treatment, which gave us 
some quite serious concern about his health and the prospect of him ever returning. It 
was my decision that I would not want to take any pre-emptive action to replace him 
… So my assessment was that I wasn’t looking to replace my deputy, I was looking to 
find some support, second opinion, guidance, you know, a reference point, for some 
of things that I did, to make sure that I wasn’t missing the sort of opportunities that 
might be around that I should do. So that led me then to think about what sort of 
resource I might take on within the sort of budget that I might have available within 
all of this, and came to the view there was a need for … someone, but not for a lot of 
time, that I needed on a retainer basis so that I could access it if or when I felt I needed 
that support.”

4.89  That decision having been taken, Mr Fedorcio took the view that he needed someone who 

had:646

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“… worked as an adviser at a senior level in an organisation, who had relevant media, 
speech-writing, public affairs experience, had knowledge, contacts, strong awareness 
of policing issues, and I wanted him to be available to give advice, possibly at short 
notice, which I thought was sort of reliable, credible advice.” 

4.90 

In the meantime, and on leaving the NoTW, Mr Wallis had formed two companies; these were 
Neil Wallis Media Ltd and Chamy Media Ltd.647 Through Neil Wallis Media Ltd, Mr Wallis applied 
his trade as a “freelance journalist selling tips and stories to news media organisations.”648 
Through Chamy Media Ltd he “provided PR advice which could be described as in some cases 
sensitive due to the identity of the client – for instance a number of senior politicians, also 
PR agencies and corporate bodies received my advice on PR matters through Chamy.”649 Mr 
Wallis suggested that having told Mr Fedorcio that he was intending to leave the NoTW, he 
had been made aware that the MPS were looking to recruit someone to provide PR advice, 
and that furthermore:650 

“I believe I said to him that although I was leaving the News of the World if he wanted 
to continue to avail himself of my advice he was free to do so. I stated that this would 
be on a “pro bono” basis.” 

4.91  Mr Fedorcio’s recollection was that he had met with Mr Wallis for lunch on 12 August 2009, 
and it was there that Mr Wallis had told him of his “new line of work as a media consultant 
and offered his services to me and the MPS.”651 Mr Fedorcio explained that over the following 
few  days  he  came  to  the  conclusion  that  Mr  Wallis  met  the  selection  criteria  and  would 
be  available  to  start  almost  immediately.652  He  then  informed  Sir  Paul  Stephenson,  then 
Commissioner  of  the  MPS,  that  he  was  considering  engaging  the  services  of  Mr  Wallis.653 
As to whether Sir Paul had expressed a view on the potential appointment at that stage, Mr 
Fedorcio said: 654 

“He didn’t express a view. I was having one of my regular meetings with him and 
we had a long list of things to talk about, and I think towards the end I just said to 
him: “I’ve considered your encouragement about finding some additional support, I 
think I now need to to [sic] it, and I’ve had a look around and … I’m considering Neil 
Wallis.” He didn’t make any comment on Neil Wallis. I think he was just pleased that 
I’d thought about taking on some support.” 

4.92  For his part, Sir Paul could not recall any discussion with Mr Fedorcio regarding Mr Wallis 

before he was recruited, although he was clear that:655

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGto be invited to tender or likely to get the job coming through a very proper process, I 
would not be discomforted by that because I had no reason to doubt – sort of doubt 
that he wasn’t a fit and proper person.” 

4.93  Mr Fedorcio recalled that he had also spoken to John Yates, formerly an Assistant Commissioner 

in the MPS, about the proposal to engage the services of Mr Wallis as:656 

“I knew he was expected to deliver a number of public speeches and presentations 
in his role and could make use of this support service. I thought he might also be 
prepared to co-finance the contract.” 

Mr Yates confirmed that “one or two” meetings took place with Mr Fedorcio and Mr Wallis 
relating to potential work for Mr Wallis.657 

4.94  Mr Fedorcio was aware that Mr Yates and Mr Wallis knew one another through work but “did 
not understand them to have any significant contact outside of work.”658 I examine Mr Yates’ 
relationship with Mr Wallis in much greater detail elsewhere.659 At this stage, it is sufficient to 
say that there is some debate as to Mr Fedorcio’s knowledge of the true extent of Mr Yates’ 
friendship with Mr Wallis. Mr Fedorcio suggested that had he been fully aware of the fact 
that the two had been “good friends”, then that would have affected his decision to seek Mr 
Yates’ advice on the potential appointment. He said:660 

“… I would have sort of moved away from John Yates in terms of seeking his views on 
the appointment, the selection. I may have gone elsewhere, to one of his deputies …” 

4.95  Moreover, Mr Fedorcio went as far to suggest that had he been fully cognisant of the nature 
of Mr Yates’ relationship with Mr Wallis, then he may have taken the view that it would have 
been  inappropriate  to  hire  Mr  Wallis.661  Nevertheless,  and  having  approached  him  for  his 
view on the matter, Mr Fedorcio suggested that Mr Yates did not express enthusiasm for Mr 
Wallis, but rather:662

“… I don’t think he expressed a view as to whether … the person involved was better 
than  anybody  else. I think  he was just prepared to take my  view on  who I should 
approach.” 

4.96  An added benefit for Mr Fedorcio in seeking the input of Mr Yates at this stage was that, as 
Assistant Commissioner Specialist Operations (ACSO), the latter had inherited responsibility 
for the phone hacking investigation.663 In those circumstances, Mr Fedorcio felt that Mr Yates 
was:664 

“… well placed to advise me on any potential risks to the organisation if Neil Wallis

hacking case.” 

4.97 

It is arguable that the very fact that the potential risk had been recognised should have ruled 
out Mr Wallis from consideration for the role. Mr Fedorcio had certainly read the Guardian 
article  of  9  July  2009  and  was  aware  of  the  allegations  made  within  it.665  Moreover,  and 
despite  Mr  Yates’  press  statement  of  9  July  2009  following  his  establishment  of  the  facts 
exercise,666 the story had not disappeared, with the MPS engaged in an ongoing debate with 
the Guardian.667 As to this point, Mr Fedorcio said:668

“…  I  don’t  think  there  had  been  anything  new  or  different  that  the  Guardian  had 
pulled out in that period from the July story. It was reinforcement of that original 
story, rather than any new lines or direction. There was nothing going on within the 
Met to say, “Do we need to have another look operationally at this?” So, you know, I, 
in the same way, was not seeing any change that I needed to reflect.”

4.98  Despite his apparent confidence that there was nothing of substance in the Guardian article 
of 9 July 2009 and the coverage beyond, Mr Fedorcio suggested that, absent the assurance 
that he subsequently received from Mr Yates, he would himself have raised the matter with 
Mr Wallis.669 Even with the added benefit of hindsight, I am afraid that this represents a failure 
on his part properly to recognise and heed the reputational risks to the MPS of engaging the 
services of Mr Wallis. As to the assurance referred to, Mr Yates spoke to Mr Wallis on 31 
August 2009, and a note of the conversation was recorded in Mr Yates’ day book at the time. 
The note read:670

“Wanted absolute assurance that there was nothing in the previous phone hacking 
matters still being reported and chased by Nick Davies that could embarrass him, 
me,  the  Commissioner  or  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service.  I  received  categorical 
assurances that this was the case.”

4.99  One could certainly question the substance of such an assurance, particularly given Mr Yates’ 
role  as  a  very  senior  police  officer.  It  is  only  necessary  to  pose  the  question  whether  Mr 
Wallis could realistically have answered in any other way. Mr Yates, however, considered the 
assurance of value, and said:671

“It was the proper assurances and the proper due diligence, as it were, is of course 
done  through  the  normal  channels  of  the  procurement  branch  in  the  Met.  It  was 
a type of formal reassurance to me that there was nothing. I wanted to be doubly 
certain. I knew the rumours that were swilling around potentially, and I just wanted 
to be absolutely certain … because I think it is me saying, “Come on, Neil, is there 
anything, anything, anything, that’s going to embarrass you, me or the Met in the 
future?” I felt it was valuable. You know, it would – if anything, it would put him off 
taking the job if he thought there was something, rather than say, “Oh yes, lots to

something. So it was me sort of reinforcing those facts with him.”

4.100  Mr Fedorcio explained that he subsequently came to the view that, on a professional basis, 
Mr  Wallis  fully  met  his  requirements.672  Further,  following  the  assurance  obtained  by  Mr 
Yates,  he  felt  that  there  were  no  reasons  as  to  why  he  should  not  go  ahead  and  discuss 
the possibility of engaging his services.673 He therefore arranged to meet with Mr Wallis to 
discuss a draft speech being prepared for the Commissioner as he was “interested in hearing 
his views on how we could improve its content and presentation and generate positive media 
coverage.”674 Mr Fedorcio explained:675

“We met for lunch on 3 September 2009 and discussed the possibility of him providing 
strategic support to me and likely costs. He offered to do some work on the speech at 
no cost to demonstrate the sort of help he could provide. He proposed a considerable 
number  of  useful  changes  and  re-writes.  I  was  very  impressed  with  what  he  had 
advised and felt that we should go ahead and seek to engage his services as soon as 
possible.” 

4.101  Mr Wallis understandably agreed with Mr Fedorcio’s assessment of his suitability for the role, 
as he put it “I thought that I could do the job that they wanted doing, yes.”676 Although in a 
different context, Mr Wallis explained that:677 

“Mr Fedorcio would know that I was a close associate of a number of senior figures 
past  and  present  at  New  Scotland  Yard  including  Commissioners,  officers  of  other 
senior rank and civilians such as himself.” 

This point was exemplified by Mr Wallis’ description of his input into the preparation of the 
Commissioner’s speech referred to above, he said:678 

“All I was doing there … was continuing to do what I’d done many times before for 
them … I was simply continuing to do what I’d done for years for them. Sometimes 
they asked me for my thoughts on things.” 

In summary, Mr Wallis agreed that the relationship he had developed with the MPS was such 
that they would see the great value in employing him to fulfil this particular position.679 

4.102  On 7 September 2009, Mr Fedorcio asked his staff to  “request a single tender process on 
the grounds of urgency for the period from then to the end of March 2010.”680 Mr Fedorcio

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGagreed, therefore, that this was going to be a tendering process with only one applicant,681 
however he explained:682 

“… what happened and what I discovered, of course, is that they should have advised 
that that wouldn’t have been possible at that stage. The procurement advice I was 
given was that this could be done in this manner. Subsequently they came back and 
said, “No, we couldn’t”, but I think the advice should have been that in the first place.”

4.103  Following  the  revised  procurement  advice,  Mr  Fedorcio  informed  Mr  Wallis  that  he  was 
“unable to put a contract in place at that time but would be inviting him to submit a quotation, 
if he wished, as part of a competitive tender process.”683 He explained that he took the decision 
to invite Peter Bingle, Charles Lewington and Mr Wallis to submit quotes by email,684 choosing 
Mr Bingle and Mr Lewington because:685 

“They’re both people that I’ve known for some time professionally, and in my selection 
criteria, they met it. In particular, both of them had previously been advisers to the 
Police Federation, so I was aware of their work for the Police Federation and their 
knowledge of policing matters.” 

The  invitation  to  quote  sought  strategic  communication  support  and  advice;  Mr  Fedorcio 
described this as taking the form of:686

“… verbal advice on the presentation of current policy matters in the areas of public 
affairs, media relations and speeches, mainly over the telephone but with occasional 
meetings.”

4.104  Mr  Bingle  was  employed  by  Bell  Pottinger  Private  Public  Relations,  and  Mr  Lewington  by 
Hanover.687 Some may argue therefore than the tendering process was immediately balanced 
in favour of Chamy Media Ltd in terms of the fees likely to be charged. Mr Fedorcio denied 
this to be the case, and said:688 

“…  I’ve  never  had  to  let  a  contract  like  this,  so  this  was  new  territory  for  me.  My 
reference  points,  I  suppose,  were  two  in  a  way.  One,  I  was  aware  of  a  colleague 
who had a daily contract with a London borough at a figure of about £800 a day, 
and … the Met had a London PR agency working on property matters whose cost, 
depending on who did the work, varied between £125 and £250 an hour. So that’s 
what my reference was. But I had no idea what either of them were going to pitch 
… Bell Pottinger recommended one of their – not their top people, one of their junior 
people to do the work … I was of the view … as I said, previously, I’d been looking at 
potential suppliers. I’d had a list in my mind, which included these two. It included a 
couple of others as possibilities, but I decided on these at the end of the day. I felt

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthey could do what I was looking for. I knew of them, and I would trust any of them. I 
would have chosen any of them to do the work.” 

4.105  It  was  certainly  the  case  that  more  could  have  been  done  to  source  PR  companies  of  a 

comparable size to Chamy Media Ltd. Mr Fedorcio conceded this point,689 but said:690 

“There is such a place to go to, but I didn’t go there, I knew Mr Bingle, I knew Mr 
Lewington, I’ve known them for a number of years. I both felt that they were … the 
sort of people that I would trust their judgment and their support.” 

4.106  Notwithstanding the above, Mr Fedorcio denied that the tender process had been set up 
to get a particular result, namely the engagement of Mr Wallis.691 He explained that he had 
received  prompt  responses  to  the  tender and  that  the  quote from  Chamy Media  Ltd  had 
been considerably lower than the other two bids, by a factor of 50 per cent.692 Mr Fedorcio 
therefore arranged for a contract to be issued for the period 1 October 2009 to March 2010 
with options for extensions.693 

4.107  It was Mr Fedorcio’s evidence that Mr Wallis never had unescorted access to MPS premises, 
and the matters discussed or advised on were all matters of public record, either put there by 
the MPS or in the published or broadcast media. Furthermore, he suggested that Mr Wallis’ 
role did not cover any operational or investigative matters, and that he had no access to any 
MPS systems. Mr Fedorcio did not believe, therefore, that personal vetting was necessary, 
and the point was never raised by anyone else.694 He also explained that despite Mr Wallis’ 
expectation that he was not to be paid for the advice that he had provided in relation to the 
Commissioner’s speech in September 2009 given that it was effectively a trial for the role, a 
receipt for that work was requested and subsequently arrangements were made for him to 
be paid.695 Mr Fedorcio provided his rationale for the retrospective payment:696

“I  thought  someone  had  done  work  for  the  Metropolitan  Police,  then  the  police 
should be prepared to pay them for it. I didn’t think we should take a freebie … I was 
of the view that I didn’t think we should be in debt to or owing for that relationship. 
I thought it was quite reasonable that he’d spent the time on it and that we should 
recognise that.” 

4.108  Once appointed to this temporary position, there was some question as to the transparency 
and internal visibility of Mr Wallis’ role within the DPA. Sara Cheesley, the senior information 
officer on the specialist operations press desk in the DPA, indicated that, on occasions, she 
would  interact with  the deputy  director, ostensibly  the role  being  filled  by Mr Wallis,  but 
had only become aware of the existence of Mr Wallis’ contract with the MPS in July 2011,

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGby which time the contract had been terminated.697 As to why she had not been aware, Ms 
Cheesley said:698

“I really couldn’t say why I wasn’t told, but clearly the decision was that there was a 
strategic gap, which I wouldn’t necessarily feel … my role is for operational matters, 
and the decision obviously was not to make me or others aware.” 

The  fact  that  somebody  of  relative  seniority  within  the  DPA  had  not  been  aware  of  Mr 
Wallis’ recruitment is slightly odd in itself, and rather adds to the air of lack of transparency 
surrounding the way in which the contract was awarded and fulfilled. 

4.109  Moving forward, on 14 July 2011, Mr Wallis was arrested as part of Operation Weeting.699 Mr 
Fedorcio explained that it was only on the day of his arrest that he first became aware that 
Mr Wallis was of interest to the MPS in relation to phone hacking and said:700 

“I discussed with the Commissioner how we should make public the details of the MPS 
contract with Chamy Media without compromising the phone hacking investigation 
or  Mr  Wallis.  The  Commissioner  advised  me  that,  because  of  my  involvement  in 
awarding the contract, I should not be involved in any decisions on this and it should 
be left to the deputy commissioner and my deputy director.” 

4.110  The details of Mr Wallis’ contract were leaked to the media during the course of the day of 
the arrest,701 and the following MPS press release was issued in relation to the use of Chamy 
Media:702

“Chamy  Media,  owned  by  Neil  Wallis,  former  Executive  Editor  of  the  News  of  the 
World,  was  appointed  to  provide  strategic  communication  advice  and  support  to 
the MPS, including advice on speech writing and PR activity, while the Met’s Deputy 
Director of Public Affairs was on extended sick leave recovering from a serious illness.

In line with MPS/MPA procurement procedures, three relevant companies were invited 
to provide costings for this service on the basis of two days per month. Chamy Media 
were appointed as they were significantly cheaper than the others. The contract ran 
from October 2009 until September 2010, when it was terminated by mutual consent.

The Commissioner has made the Chair of the police authority aware of this contract.”

4.111  With  the  benefit  of  hindsight,  Sir  Paul  expressed  regret  that  the  MPS  had  entered  into  a 
contract with Mr Wallis and it is not difficult to understand why he took that view. He said: 703

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“… without any presumption of guilt or innocence around Mr Wallis’ current position, 
but  quite  clearly  the  hiring  of  Wallis  played  very,  very  badly  in  the  way  that  the 
perception of this story was taken.” 

4.112  The perception referred to by Sir Paul was perhaps best illustrated by a statement made by 

Mr Wallis himself, when he said:704 

“I do recall at some stage reference being made that the Metropolitan Police Service 
would now be paying me for the service which I had been providing free of charge for 
many years.” 

Whilst there was no evidence that Mr Wallis’ work for the MPS had any effect on operational 
decisions,  whether  in  respect  of  the  phone  hacking  investigation  or  any  other  case,  a 
damaging perception was created that the contract awarded to Chamy Media Ltd was simply 
an extension of Mr Wallis’ carefully built relationship with the MPS. This was a relationship 
which appeared to be overly close; and one which created a perception of influence. 

4.113  In  respect  of  Mr  Fedorcio,  a  perception  was  also  clearly  created  that  his  long  standing 
relationship with Mr Wallis had influenced the appointment process. There is no evidence 
to suggest that the process itself, once instituted, was not conducted fairly, but whatever its 
adequacy, the fact remained that there was an appearance of bias, particularly given that Mr 
Wallis had already completed work for the MPS. On 29 March 2012, the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced that Mr Fedorcio had a case to answer upon gross 
misconduct charges for offering a contract to Chamy Media Ltd following which Mr Fedorcio 
resigned.705  In  light  of  the  IPCC’s  investigation  report  into  this  matter,  I  do  not  intend  to 
address this issue any further.706 

The recruitment by the MPS of Neil Wallis’ daughter707

4.114  On 27 January 2009 Mr Wallis, then Executive Editor of the NoTW, sent an email to Mr Yates 
with the CV of his daughter attached. Mr Wallis said that in early 2009 he had become aware 
that there were a number of unfilled low grade casual clerical positions within the MPS and it 
was this knowledge which precipitated his email.708 Mr Wallis explained that he had sent the 
email to Mr Yates because he did not know the head of human resources at the MPS and said 
that, in effect, asking a friend or a contact to pass on a CV of your child was “the way of the 
world”, noting that on occasions he had given work experience to the children of journalists 
from other newspapers.709 

4.115  Rightly  or  wrongly,  the  practice  of  referring  friends  and  relatives  for  appointment  on  a 
temporary or permanent basis within the MPS would appear to be have fairly commonplace

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGalthough there may be an important difference between paid (even temporary) employment 
and unpaid work experience (which I discuss below). Martin Tiplady, the then Director of 
Human  Resources  for  the  MPS,  said  in  an  email  to  Mr  Yates  in  relation  to  this  potential 
recruitment  of  Ms  Wallis  to  the  effect  that  a  number  of  senior  officers  in  the  MPS  had 
referred relatives and friends to them in order that they might be considered for temporary 
employment.710 

4.116  Mr Yates described his involvement in this matter as being limited to “acting as a post-box 
and forwarding her expression of interest to … Martin Tiplady. I had no influence over the 
decision to offer [Mr Wallis’ daughter] work with the MPS and I did not encourage anyone else 
to do so.”711 Mr Fedorcio also said that he played no part, formally or informally, in Ms Wallis 
obtaining work at the MPS and did not encourage the offer of work to her.712 The email from 
Mr Yates to Mr Tiplady, sent on 29 January 2009, stated:713

“Bit of advice plse [sic] – the attached CV belongs to the daughter of Neil Wallis, the 
Dep Editor of the News of the World. You probably know that Neil has been a great 
friend (and occasional critic) of the Met in past years and has been a close advisor to 
Paul [Stephenson] on stuff/tactics in respect of the new Commissionership.

Mr Wallis’ daughter is looking for a change of direction and something steady – a bit 
along the lines of the work that my son did recently – although she looks eminently 
qualified to do something more demanding. I have met her on several occasions and 
although would not claim to know her well she is clearly bright, very personable and 
presents well.

Clearly  there  is  a  vetting  issue  which  would  prob  [sic]  have  to  go  through  normal 
channels unless you advise me otherwise.

Be grateful for an early response so I can manage expectations with both Neil and his 
daughter.” 

4.117  Mr Yates’ description of Mr Wallis is interesting in itself. However, and specifically in relation 
to his involvement in this matter, Mr Yates disagreed that there was at least the perception 
of  influence  created  by  the  fact  that  Mr  Wallis’  daughter  did  ultimately  obtain  a  position 
within the MPS, pointing out that the recipient of the email, Mr Tiplady, was a peer on the 
management board “who had a reputation for telling it as it is”.714 

4.118  That said, on 15 July 2011 Ms Wallis declared her connection to Mr Wallis in line with MPS 
policy following her father’s arrest the previous day, and on 18 July 2011 the Metropolitan 
Police  Authority  (MPA)  recorded  the  conduct  of  Mr  Yates’  role  in  the  employment  of  Ms 
Wallis and the matter was referred to the IPCC for investigation.715 I make it abundantly clear

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthat Mr Wallis’ daughter was not, herself, the subject of any investigation and there is (and 
never has been) the slightest suggestion that she had acted inappropriately in relation to the 
manner in which she obtained employment with the MPS. 

4.119  The IPCC on 19 October 2011, and in their final report published in March 2012, found no 
evidence that Mr Yates had directly influenced the appointment of Ms Wallis and accordingly 
concluded  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  his  actions  and  involvement  amounted  to 
misconduct. The IPCC went on to say, however:716

“…  it  is  however  evident  that  the  email  chain  between  two  members  of  the  MPS 
senior management board was perceived by more junior staff to be in the nature of 
an instruction to find a job for Ms Wallis – and this should have been foreseeable both 
to Mr Yates and Mr Tiplady. Whether or not it was “routine” for senior officers to pass 
on CVs it was poor judgement to do so, bearing in mind the appearance of favouritism. 
Mr Yates’s claim that he was “simply a post box” should be read alongside the full 
text of his email which refers to the relationship of the owner of the CV to Neil Wallis, 
described as “… a great friend (and occasional critic) of the Met in past years and 
has been a close advisor to Paul [Stephenson] on stuff/tactics in respect of the new 
Commissionership.”

4.120  For the purposes of this Inquiry, and in relation to this specific issue, I am satisfied that I have 

heard nothing which would cause me to come to a different conclusion to that of the IPCC.

Work experience students

4.121  In 2003 or 2004 Mr Fedorcio approached the then editor of The Sun, Rebekah Wade (now 
Brooks), to see if his son (who was considering a career in journalism) could undertake a 
week’s relevant work experience. He explained that the arrangements were made between 
his son’s school and the HR department of The Sun and that when he was there:717 

“… he spent some time on the Bizarre desk. I think he spent some time on the general 
news desk. I think he also spent some time on the online version of the paper. I’m not 
totally sure, but that’s my recollection.” 

After Mr Fedorcio’s son had successfully completed this period of work experience he was 
invited to return if he wished. He took up that offer after university, completing a further 
four-week placement in 2007.718 Mr Fedorcio acknowledged that The Sun was aware that the 
initial placement was for his son but strongly denied that this was an example of “favours 
being called in”, he said:719

“I don’t believe it was at all. Not as far as I was concerned. And the arrangement at 
that stage in 2007, I was not involved in. That was a matter between my son and the 
Sun direct.”

888

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG4.122  In July 2005 Lord Blair’s son also undertook a week’s work experience at The Sun. Lord Blair 

explained that:720 

I  arranged  through  Dick  Fedorcio  …  for  my  15  year  old  son  to  do  a  week’s  work 
experience  at  the  Sun  newspaper.  Arranging  work  experience  for  young  people  in 
this  manner  was  perfectly  commonplace  at  that  time;  the  current  debate  about 
formalising arrangements for internships had not then begun. I had a whole series of 
young people do attachments, although none of them to my knowledge were from 
press-related families.” 

As to why The Sun newspaper in particular, Lord Blair said:721 

“…  I  think  that  Mr  Fedorcio  mentioned  that  Paul  Condon’s  son  had  done  work 
experience at the Sun, so I said, “Oh, well, that’s the kind of thing that would excite 
most 15-year-olds, so I think that should be a good idea”. That’s all I thought about 
it …” 

As Lord Blair noted, this kind of arrangement was commonplace at the time, and moreover, 
The Sun was not known for being particularly favourable towards, or close to, Lord Blair during 
the period of his Commissionership. As Michael Sullivan, the crime editor of The Sun, put it:722 

“… the Sun … had a fairly ambivalent approach to Sir Ian, as he then was. I don’t think 
he was our cup of tea and I dare say we wouldn’t have been his cup of tea …” 

4.123  I  do  not  believe that  there is  anything  of  substance in  the instances  detailed  above.  It is, 
indeed, commonplace for parents in any walk of life to seek to arrange work experience for 
their teenage children in places that they will find attractive and to do so by contacting those 
whom  they  know.  Today,  there  is  much  greater  awareness  of  the  potential  disadvantage 
suffered by those whose parents do not have any such contacts but I do not consider that this 
sort of interaction creates any concern. I am not surprised that a teenager would find work 
experience on a tabloid of real interest: there is no basis even for any perception of undue 
closeness as a result. 

Loan of a horse to Rebekah Brooks

4.124  A similar conclusion can be reached in relation to this issue, which was the cause of some 
public comment. It came to light initially through the evidence of Lord Blair, who explained 
that the MPS maintained an arrangement whereby members of the public could apply to be 
given a horse which had been retired from the MPS mounted branch. He said:723 

“The Met has about 100 horses, of which I assume a regular proportion are released, 
and this is a regular event, because the horse is still well but it is not strong enough 
to do the work that it’s required to do, and the Met, I presume, quite understandably, 
doesn’t want to put them down. So I think this is quite regular …” 

Lord Blair reported his understanding that at some point during his period as Commissioner,

889

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGMs Brooks made such an application.724

4.125  Mr Fedorcio was able to elaborate on the circumstances which led, ultimately, to the loan of 
a MPS horse to Mrs Brooks. He recalled that Mrs Brooks approached him about the scheme 
and expressed interest in offering a home to a retired police horse in September 2007.725 Mr 
Fedorcio placed her in contact with the relevant officer of the mounted branch and said that 
he “felt this could possibly lead to some positive coverage about the care of retired police 
horses.”726 Furthermore, Mr Fedorcio agreed that he would arrange for Mrs Brooks to visit 
the Imber Court stables and introduce her to Inspector Hiscock who was in charge of the 
scheme.727 He subsequently made the then Commissioner, Lord Blair, aware of the approach 
and the action taken. He said:728 

“I spoke to the Commissioner because on the day that I was due to take her to Imber 
Court, we were having lunch with Rebekah Wade, and I thought it would be wrong 
for Rebekah Wade to turn up at the lunch, having been at the Metropolitan Police 
Stables that morning and had such a discussion with the officer, and I assumed one 
of her first lines would be: “I’ve had a very interesting morning at stables”, and the 
Commissioner would have looked blank. I thought he needed to be briefed on what 
might come up over lunch.” 

4.126  The visit to the stables took place on 19 September 2007 and thereafter, neither Lord Blair 
nor Mr Fedorcio had any dealings with Mrs Brooks in respect of her interest in the loan of the 
MPS horse and she was left to deal directly with Inspector Hiscock.729 Mr Fedorcio explained 
that there was then a nine month gap between the initial meeting and Mrs Brooks receiving 
the horse, which was some time in July 2008.730 In the intervening period it transpired that 
a suitable horse had been identified and that Inspector Hiscock had visited and checked the 
facilities being offered by Mrs Brooks for the care of the animal.731 In relation to his role in this 
affair, Mr Fedorcio said that he was “keen that if she was able to enter the scheme like any 
other member of the public, then she should be able to.”732 

4.127  I am quite sure that Mr Fedorcio’s initial assistance in this matter went beyond what a member 
of the public could expect in similar circumstances, however, I have heard nothing to suggest 
that there was anything irregular about the loan of the horse given the standard checks that 
were apparently performed by Inspector Hiscock. For her part, Mrs Brooks strongly denied 
that there was any connection or exchange between the work experience placement offered 
to Mr Fedorcio’s son, and the acquisition of the police horse.733 I have no reason to believe 
that there is.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGDPA staff and media employment

4.128  The fact that Mr Wallis and his daughter were employed by the MPS, and that Mr Hayman and 
Lord Stevens were engaged to write articles for the Times and the NoTW respectively gave 
rise to the allegation that there was a ‘revolving door’ of employment between the MPS and 
NI. This in turn raised more general questions as to the appropriateness of former journalists 
being  employed  by  the  Police  Service.  The  ‘revolving  door’  allegation  was  made  by  Brian 
Paddick, formerly a Deputy Assistant Commissioner in the MPS, and was echoed by James 
Murray, Associate News Editor of the Sunday Express, who asserted that “the Metropolitan 
Police did have a lot of ex News Of The World journalists but I could not understand why. It 
was exceptional.”734 

4.129  On examination, however, these assertions would not appear to be borne out by the facts. 
Mr  Fedorcio  told  the  Inquiry  that  within  the  DPA,  of  32  members  of  staff  with  a  media 
background, there were 12 who had previously worked for NI titles.735 Of these only three 
had worked for the NoTW and all were part time staff.736 Mr Fedorcio explained that:737

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“… I’ve looked through the data that’s provided those raw numbers, and I find it quite 
interesting the three staff who have worked for the News of the World, one of them 
worked on some freelance shifts there between 1988 and 89, so over 20 years ago. 
The second one had a four-month contract in 1995, so 15 years ago, and the third 
worked some freelance shifts between 2001 and 2004. So there is no one within the 
department  who  has  worked  for  the  News  of  the  World  since  2004.  on  the  wider 
Murdoch media, the other nine, as it were, four of those worked for Sky News, one 
for the London Paper and the Sun had worked for both the organisations, two had 
worked for the Sun, one for six months, one for five weeks, and one had one week’s 
work experience on the Times …”

4.130  Mr Stearns, who had worked for the Daily Mail for seven years and for two years at a PR 
agency prior to joining the DPA,738 defended the employment of former journalists as police 
press officers. He said:739

“In my view, if I want to recruit the most capable press officers then I want people 
with the right skills, such as news sense, good writing skills, good interpersonal skills 
and good overall communication skills. When we advertise jobs we get a wide range 
of  people  applying  –  including  reporters.  Sometimes,  but  not  always,  ex-reporters 
are the strongest candidates and therefore I do not feel it is right to exclude a strong 
candidate on the basis that they have been a reporter.” 

4.131  Mr Stearns also pointed out that all DPA staff were recruited by the MPS in open competition 
and in accordance with the process laid down by the Government Communication Network 
(GCN).740 He went on to say that:741

“In  general  those  that  have  worked  in  the  news  media  have  worked  for  multiple 
organisations – for example, of the six staff who have paid employment for the Sun 
or News of the World (mainly on a freelance shift basis) all have worked for between 
three to seven news organisations before joining the MPS. In addition, four of these 
staff left the media over ten years ago. Other staff have worked for a wide range of 
local newspapers and other national media groups.” 

4.132  This would not appear to be particularly unusual within the Police Service. The West Midlands 
Police had a communications team of 30, of which five were trained journalists and four had 
a background within local journalism.742 Similarly, in South Wales Police three members of 
the 20 staff in its communication team had previously worked for the media.743 Perhaps more 
striking  in  this  regard  was  the  example  of  Surrey  Police.  The  experience  of  managing  the 
media interest generated by the Milly Dowler investigation led to a number of changes to 
its Media Relations Team. This included increasing the number of ex-journalists who were 
recruited, to the point that by 2012, all Surrey Police Media Relations Officers had experience 
of either local or national journalism. It was said that these staff brought with them a better 
understanding of the demands placed upon journalists and the knowledge of how to build

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGan effective and professional relationship that met the needs of both parties.744 As Lord Blair 
put it “if they don’t have experience of the media, how good are they going to be to you as 
press officers?”745 

4.133  This  viewpoint  was  shared  by  Stephen  House,  Chief  Constable  of  Strathclyde  Police,  who 

said:746

“We  actively  recruit  into  our  media  department  from  journalists  …  and  to  say  we 
won’t  accept  journalists  into  our  media  department  would  be  the  wrong  decision 
because we’re looking for people who understand what journalists are looking for 
and are there to assist them in getting what they need within the requirements of our 
organisation …”

Similarly, Jerry Kirkby, Assistant Chief Constable of Surrey Police, said:747

“… Personally, I think having professionally trained individuals who come from that 
background [i.e. journalism] is a good way of actually doing it and it works for us …”

4.134  Broadly speaking, it would appear that movement from the print media to public relations or 
communications specialism (within the Police Service) was in practice a one-way street. Mr 
Fedorcio, for example, could only recall one member of DPA staff joining the media, but this 
in his view “never caused any problems or concerns.”748 Mr Stearns’ evidence was of a similar 
nature, he said that “my colleagues in DPA and I can only recollect one individual in over 20 
years who has moved back into journalism. I believe this illustrates that there isn’t, generally, 
a two way movement between these jobs.”749 Part of his explanation for this position was that 
an employed job in PR or communications provides greater job security for those who have 
been previously working on shifts at a newspaper, and that generally the level of pay is better. 
He said:750 

“Once someone in journalism has taken a decision to leave to take an employed job, 
such as working for the DPA, these lifestyle choices mean that they rarely go back. 
Obviously, I’m not saying it never happens, but as the experience at the DPA shows, 
it is far from common.”

4.135  Mr  Stearns  also  suggested  that  the  concept  of  journalists  working  for  the  Police  Service, 
amassing contacts and confidential information, then returning to the media with a plethora 
of unethically sourced exclusives was a myth. He said:751

“It is extremely common for people entering a range of PR jobs to have had a media 
background as the skill set needed to work in communications has many similarities 
to working in the news media. In my view and experience, this does not mean that

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthose leaving behind a media career continue to have allegiance to their previous 
employer  …  although  I  have  friends  and  acquaintances  who  are  journalists  that  I 
have known throughout my working life, this does not mean that I reveal confidential 
information to them over a pint in the pub. It is normal for any individual working 
in  a  particular  job  to  have  both  friends  and  acquaintances  who  do  the  same  job; 
these  are  the  people  you  meet  and  develop  working  relationships  and  friendships 
with. It is not unusual; it is the same the world over in any profession. But this does 
not mean that when I, or any other journalist, leave a newspaper that suddenly we 
have no respect for duties of confidentiality or integrity and are leaking information 
back to our former employer … To suggest otherwise shows a lack of understanding 
of those who regard journalism and PR as a profession and take pride in their work. 
Most journalists in my experience have a due and proper regard for the bounds of 
confidentiality; not least because of our experience in protecting sources for whom 
public identification could be devastating.” 

4.136  Similarly, Mr House said that he would not be concerned about a former journalist leaving 

the Police Service to return to journalism, he said:752

 “… If someone from the media comes into our organisation and then goes back out 
again into the media, you are reliant upon professional code of ethics, both journalists 
and  the  police.  I  have  to  say  that  we  have  a  number  of  people  within  our  media 
department who have been journalists and worked in the media and we experience 
no  problem.  If  they  were  to  turn  around  and  go  back  into  the  media,  would  I  be 
concerned? Actually, I wouldn’t be, because they’re good at what they do and if they 
go and work for someone else, they’ll be good …” 

4.137  There were other slightly differing views as to what limitations, if any, should be placed on 
former journalists now working within the Police Service rejoining the media. Lord Blair was 
of the view that it would not be appropriate to put a restriction on a journalist working for 
the MPS going back to the print media because “that is his or her profession”.753 Similarly, Sir 
Paul Stephenson said that:754 

“… I would be very reticent about recommending a restriction around junior officers. 
It seems to me that’s not the problem that we’ve had and I think that would be a 
disproportionate response …” 

Mr Fedorcio on the other hand thought that a cooling off period may be appropriate but this 
would depend on the type of work undertaken whilst in the Police Service.755

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG4.138  I set out my reflections and conclusions on this issue in Part G Chapter 4 below.

Former senior MPS staff taking media jobs, writing books and articles

4.139  Of greater concern from the standpoint of perception and good practice is the issue of former 
senior police officers and staff taking media jobs, or writing books (to be serialised in the press) 
or newspaper articles, shortly after the conclusion of their tenure within the Police Service. It 
is true to say that the issues that arose concerning former MPS police officers and staff taking 
on such work was largely limited to those who attained the highest office. Of those who gave 
evidence to the Inquiry who have written books or regular newspaper columns, all but one 
was either a former Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner in the MPS. The exception was 
Mr Paddick, who subsequently sought to develop a political career.756 

4.140  As has been described, in 2006, Lord Stevens published his autobiography, “Not for the Faint-
hearted”, and the book was serialised in the NoTW and The Times.757 From that contract came 
a further contract to write seven articles for the NoTW. The contract for these articles was 
then renewed for a further year with a maximum of nine articles, but Lord Stevens terminated 
the contract in October 2007, with only four articles having been written that year.758 Lord 
Blair began writing and broadcasting for payment about a year after he left office, publishing 
“Policing Controversy” in 2009.759 Mr Hayman, having the left the MPS in April 2008, entered 
into a contract with The Times in the August of that year and continued writing until July 
2011.760 He also wrote a book (with the journalist Margaret Gilmore) titled “The Terrorist 
Hunters” which was published in 2010.761

4.141  There were certainly differing attitudes to the issue of writing books or performing the role 
of  a  media  commentator  or  columnist  after  leaving  office.  Lord  Condon  said  that  he  had 
personally declined all offers to write a book about his time as Commissioner. Similarly, he 
declined  all  offers  to  be  a  columnist  or  retained  commentator  for  particular  newspapers, 
television or radio. He said that he had declined offers:762

“…  not  because  I  saw  anything  morally  or  ethically  wrong  per  se  …  having  spent 
my career sort of trying to major on integrity, independence, being apolitical, it just 
seemed that I would have to take decisions and be partial and be drawn into favouring 
or  working  with  one  group  over  another  …  my  view  is  there  is  nothing  inherently 
wrong in that, it just … would have taken me out of my comfort zone …” 

4.142  Sir Paul Stephenson expressed doubts about officers publishing soon after leaving office and 

said:763

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“… I am nervous about restraining people when they leave public office because we 
shouldn’t discourage people from coming into public office in the first place. But I am 
not a fan of people going into print so soon after leaving public office, perhaps for 
another reason that’s not really relevant to the Inquiry, and that is it makes it very 
difficult for existing post holders if they think that every discussion might suddenly 
find its way into print shortly after somebody leaves office. I think it’s a debate that 
has many sides and I don’t say I’m right on this. I just simply say I’m not a fan …”

4.143  I have previously made the point that I can identify a potential risk, in terms of the public 
interest, in recently retired senior police officers immediately providing a commentary on 
policing matters, given its capability to undermine legitimately taken operational decisions, 
even where an alternative approach might also have been appropriate. Sean O’Neill, Crime 
Editor of The Times, who was instrumental in the hiring of Mr Hayman for his newspaper, 
accepted  that  such  employment  ran  the  risk  of  undermining  those  who  were  then  in 
command:764

“I see the risk where someone with recent experience of the management board is 
writing about it, I can see that. I can see that if a person has a score to settle, that 
might be done.” 

4.144  Despite this, Mr O’Neill believed that former senior police officers offered:765

“… a valuable insight into the workings of the police and the way the police behave. 
Any imposition of a “cooling off period” between leaving the police and commenting 
in  the  media  would  reduce  their  relevance.  The  policing  world  can  change  very 
quickly (as we have seen in the wholesale transformation of the leadership of the 
Met recently) and it is most helpful to the readers to have relevant and contemporary 
voices writing and commenting on it.”

4.145  HMIC,  in  their  review  report  “Without  fear  or  favour  –  a  review  of  police  relationships”, 
recorded  that  there  was  “little  evidence  of  “cooling  off”  periods  being  required  for  senior 
staff leaving to take up posts with commercial or other bodies with related interests.”766 This 
is certainly the case in relation to the MPS, which generally does not impose restrictions as to 
the future employment which police officers or staff can accept on leaving the organisation. 
Police officers are governed by Police Regulations, which do not include such a restraint in 
respect of any future employment.767 

4.146  The terms and conditions of employment for ACPO-ranked officers issued by the Metropolitan 
Police Authority (MPA) had a clause concerning post authority employment and appointments. 
It  provided  that  before  accepting  any  appointment  which  would  start  within  one  year  of 
leaving the MPS, the approval of the Chief Executive of the MPA was necessary in cases where 
the employment was with (a) an organisation, firm or business providing any commercial 
or contractual services to the MPS or to the Authority, or (b) where the organisation, firm 
or business intends to tender for the provision of such services. The clause further stated 
that the approval of the MPA would not be “unreasonably withheld.”768 However, Catherine

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGCrawford, formerly Chief Executive of the MPA (now the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime 
or  MOPC),  confirmed  that  the  clause  was  directed  towards  procurement  contracts  rather 
than employment with the media, and that furthermore, there was currently no contractual 
impediment to prevent an ACPO officer on leaving the MPS to begin to work immediately for 
the press.769

4.147  There  were  varying  opinions  as  to  the  need  to  contractually  prevent  officers  from  taking 
media related jobs for a set period of time. Commissioner Hogan-Howe confirmed that he 
or the MOPC could seek to introduce such a restriction for senior officers of ACPO rank or 
above, particularly for those who are appointed on fixed term contracts or whose service is 
terminated on agreed terms.770 He suggested that any “restraint of trade clause” should be 
restricted to a reasonable period.771 On this he said:772 

“… it seems to me that something of the order between 12 months and two years is 
probably where this might settle, but I certainly would advise a cooling-off period.” 

Lord Blair said that the lack of any restriction on future employment, beyond the duty of 
confidentiality that police officers and staff are subject to pursuant to the Official Secrets Act, 
was a source of concern.773 He said:774 

“I am sure this is a situation that should be changed, even though that might have 
meant that there was some limitation on me writing and broadcasting for payment … 
It is my view that a restriction period of two years would be appropriate.” 

This two year period would apply to “senior staff who have access to the most sensitive and 
detailed information.”775 

4.148  Similarly, Sir Paul Stephenson said:776 

“… all senior officers do have what’s called a fixed-term appointment, which is a kind 
of pseudo-contract, which allows for discussion between the employer and that senior 
officer, which doesn’t exist with junior officers, to actually put certain conditions in 
there  of  their  employment  …  And  it  might  be  worthy  of  consideration  in  terms  of 
engendering public confidence – and of course I’m thinking of the perceptions that 
come out of this very matter itself – it might be worthy of consideration for further 
thought to be given to: should there be some sort of time bar or should there be some 
sort of consideration before a senior officer – and we’d have to discuss the level of 
seniority – takes up full-time direct employment with the media?”

897

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG4.149  However, Sir Paul was slightly more equivocal on this matter than the current Commissioner 

and Lord Blair, for he went on to say:777 

“…  I’m  nervous  about  it  because  I’m  nervous  about  any  restraint  of  trade,  and 
I’m nervous about stopping people making a contribution, but I do think that this 
particular Inquiry and the whole matters that have been deeply distressing for many 
people and the difficult position for the Met, it’s worthy of consideration. I simply say 
that …” 

4.150  Mr House took a slightly different view. He certainly saw risks in senior officers moving on to 

a writing or media career following retirement but said:778

“… I think if it’s done in the right way, it’s done authoritatively about technical issues 
to inform the public, to provide a useful inject of experience and done for positive 
reasons, it’s a good thing. If it’s done for revenge and settling of some scores, and “let 
me tell you what really happened”, then it’s disappointing.” 

He did not feel that a cooling off period was the “right thing to do in many respects” because 
“one has to trust senior police officers and 99 per cent are completely trustworthy”.779 

4.151  Whilst mindful of the concerns expressed by Sir Paul Stephenson and Mr House in particular, 
on balance I have come to the conclusion that consideration should be given to the terms 
on which ACPO rank officers are engaged and, in particular to whether these terms should 
be amended to prevent employment by media organisations in much the same way as the 
previous MPA contracts prevented employment by those with a contractual relationship with 
the MPS. I appreciate that regard must be had to issues of restraint of trade and, the rights 
to  seek  employment  to  freedom  of  expression  and,  additionally,  to  the  public  interest  in 
receiving information. With this in mind, it seems to me that a time bar of twelve months 
would be sufficient to provide an appropriate balance between the rights of the individual 
and public interest concerns relating to future employment by the media.

4.152  As I am not in a position to consider all the ramifications of such a proposal my recommendation 

is, therefore, limited. I set this out in Part G Chapter 4 below.

5.  The problems of friendship

5.1 

Andy Hayman
Andy Hayman joined Essex police in 1978, serving in a variety of uniform and CID roles as he 
worked his way through the ranks. He was Chief Constable in Norfolk from January 2002 to 
February 2005 when he transferred back to the MPS as an Assistant Commissioner in charge 
of Specialist Operations (ACSO). Mr Hayman therefore had overall responsibility for Operation 
Caryatid  having  been  ACSO  during  the  relevant  period  of  time.780  In  around  2003  he  was 
selected to be Head of the ACPO Media Committee. Mr Hayman announced his retirement 
from the MPS in December 2007 and left the organisation on 17 April 2008.781

898

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG5.2  Mr Hayman told the Inquiry that, in his view, it was important for the MPS and all police 
forces to maintain a healthy, collaborative working relationship with the media so that they 
could build and maintain public confidence in the police.782 On entering ACPO, Mr Hayman 
described his challenge to the more reserved position of some of his colleagues who he said 
preferred to keep the media at arms length; it was his view that the public expected a senior 
officer to be visible.783 In analysing the relationship between the police and the media, Mr 
Hayman concluded that there was a benefit to both sides in having a professional relationship, 
but  that  the  terms  of  engagement  between  the  two  had  to  be  clearly  understood.784  Mr 
Hayman said:785

“I came to this work with the background … of being very reserved towards the media. 
I didn’t feel I needed to engage, because I felt that sometimes that kind of relationship 
was difficult. There was some – if you went and speak [sic] with colleagues, there 
were probably experiences where it wasn’t particularly positive on either side. So I 
saw that at worst there could be the media’s objective to try and get exclusives and 
cross a line, and on the other side at worst, from the police side, the danger would be 
that maybe people would cosy up and start leaking inappropriately [sic] information 
to the media. But I didn’t feel that that was necessarily an obstacle to embark on this 
work. That was just something that we needed to manage. I have to say, trying to 
drive this nationally was difficult, because I think people always went to their default 
position of this is just too difficult, I’m not going to do it.” 

5.3 

Despite this initially reserved stance towards the media, Mr Hayman confirmed that he would 
meet with journalists where he believed that it would benefit the MPS and its mission.786 
He  described  his  professional  relationship  with  the  media  as  becoming  “more  intense”,787 
as he performed the national roles as ACSO and the ACPO Media Lead. As his professional 
relationship  with  the  media  developed,  Mr  Hayman  clearly  understood  that  their  contact 
with him may have been for a broader purpose than simply to better their understanding of 
the policing challenges of the time. He said:788

“… I think if you look at the media in its broadest sense, which just doesn’t include the 
written media, it includes radio and TV, is that there’s not one type, there’s all different 
styles and approaches, just as there are with senior police officers or junior police 
officers. It would be a lot easier, wouldn’t it, if everyone was operating in the same 
way, but they don’t, and therefore I think what I’m trying to say there diplomatically 
is there may be – I would like to think that the mainstream would see it for what it is, 
that relationship, but I hope I’m not naïve to realise that there may be other agendas 
playing which people might seek to exploit.”

5.4 

This difference in style and approach to the media by senior individuals within the Police 
Service, as described by Mr Hayman, has certainly become evident during the course of this

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGInquiry. There was clearly a social element to the interaction between Mr Hayman and the 
media. He described his attitude to these more social encounters:789

“… I can’t remember whether I inherited it or not, but there was a structure in place 
where with this Crime Reporters Association there were regular lunches which my 
colleague, Peter Clarke, would go to, and when I joined the Met, that’s something 
that I did as well. And it’s on a regular basis. The purpose of those lunches was to 
develop and foster the relationship I tried to describe earlier where you just didn’t 
pick up when you wanted something. Of course I was operating here with two hats 
on, and I was trying to do the same nationally with the ACPO media group hat on, and 
therefore what I felt there was an awful lot of benefit in probably going the extra mile 
with that ACPO hat on, because I wanted to get traction not just in London but also 
elsewhere, and I wanted to support the media officers within each force accordingly. 
So that would extend beyond a lunch, and I would have meetings in the evening at 
dinner, not necessarily in London, it could be elsewhere. And I remember one event 
… with the Society of Editors where I think I spoke at their conference, so it would be 
beyond just those CRA lunches, but I would want to make sure everyone understood 
that the social scene of interacting was businesslike, but it was also to develop the 
relationship which hopefully I could have built on around that plan I set out.”

5.5 

It might be said that it is incumbent upon whoever has the role of ACPO Media Lead and ACSO to 
foster relations with the media in this way. However, the level and type of interaction with the 
media in these two roles does appear to be individualistic in nature. Chief Constable Trotter, 
the current ACPO Media Lead, told the Inquiry that although from time to time he met with 
editors and journalists to discuss any areas of current concern, the contact was fairly sporadic 
and would “very infrequently” encompass a lunch or a dinner.790 Assistant Commissioner Dick, 
the current Assistant Commissioner responsible for Specialist Operations, confirmed, to the 
best of her knowledge, that in the 11 years that she had been an ACPO officer in the MPS, 
she had had just one lunch with a journalist, and on that occasion she had been accompanied 
by a press officer. She also confirmed that on one occasion she had attended a charity dinner 
paid for by the CRA, and had attended three of the CRA annual drinks party with the MPS in 
those 11 years; she emphasised that she would always decline alcohol at those events.791 The 
stark difference in approach to their interaction with the media between Mr Hayman and Ms 
Dick would also appear to have been recognised internally within the MPS; Sara Cheesley, 
for example, agreed that Mr Hayman’s approach was somewhat more expansive than Ms 
Dick’s.792

5.6 

That is not necessarily to say that a less expansive approach to interacting with the media 
is preferable; however, there are clear dangers involved for police officers and other senior 
public officials in developing overly close social relationships with journalists where there is a 
pre-existing professional relationship, particularly where hospitality and alcohol are engaged. 
Jane  Furniss  of  the  Independent  Police  Complaints  Commission  succinctly  articulated  the 
potential dangers in this way:793

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“… I do think it’s very unwise to develop social relationships between people who 
have a professional relationship. Of course friendships develop and … one wouldn’t 
want to restrict that, but being very clear about the boundaries. As I said earlier, I 
don’t think journalists wine and dine senior public officials because they like them. 
They do it because they want something. They want to influence decisions. As I said 
earlier, alcohol in those circumstances makes that even riskier, because the risk is that 
all of us become more indiscreet, more relaxed in those circumstances. The biggest 
problem about alcohol is it impairs your judgment and it leads you to believe your 
judgment isn’t impaired, so it makes it doubly risky, doesn’t it? So in my – from my 
point of view … this is something you do when you’re with friends, not something you 
do when you’re at work, and the perception is a really important part of it because 
public confidence in bodies like mine and in the police is based on the belief that we 
are doing our job in the public interest, with integrity and without any bias. Those 
are really important principles that we should all feel very strongly that we should 
protect.” 

5.7 

Perhaps the best illustration of this point was made during John Twomey’s evidence to the 
Inquiry. He described meeting Mr Hayman for lunch on two or three occasions with a view 
to  learning  more  about  the  general  context  of  counter-terrorism  police  operations.794  Mr 
Twomey  admitted  that  given  the  social  nature  of  the  interaction,  the  conversations  went 
wider than simply a discussion about counter-terrorism policing:795

“Well, there might be references to – I don’t think they occurred really that often. I 
think – because they were social occasions, there would be a portion – a large portion 
of  the  conversation  would  be  about,  say,  anti-terrorism,  putting  it  in  the  context. 
There would be other general matters you might talk to people about over lunch, 
subjects like the news of the day, anything that was – that had captured people’s 
attention that morning, in the morning’s newspapers perhaps.”

5.8  Mr  Twomey  also  provided  the  Inquiry  with  an  insight  into  the  behaviour  of  Mr  Hayman 

following the consumption of alcohol:796

“He was freer in the way he expressed himself. I think if – unguarded – if you mean if 
he gave away secrets, no, I don’t think he did. He certainly didn’t do in my presence, 
not when he was talking about counter-terrorism or anything else, for that matter, 
and it was always clearly – I’m sorry if I’m repeating myself, but it was always – on 
those social  occasions, there was this strict rule anyway that applied: it was non-
reportable.”

5.9 

Lord  Blair  would  appear  to  have  recognised  the  dangers  inherent  in  this  type  of  social 
interaction. He described in his book, ‘Policing Controversy’, his view that Mr Hayman appeared 
to be spending a great deal of time with the press, and that there were rumours that he was 
briefing  in  an  inappropriate  manner  and  had  developed  a  lifestyle  of  late  evenings  which 
could be a danger to his professional standing. To be fair to Mr Hayman, however, Lord Blair 
acknowledged that he never had any proof that Mr Hayman was briefing inappropriately.797 
Mr Hayman provided this response to Lord Blair’s assertions:798

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“If you viewed it as my primary role in the Met, I can understand why he might say 
that,  his  opinion.  But  if  you  put  my  other hat  on  as  well,  I  would  argue  that  that 
was a proportionate amount of time being spent. He’s expressed a view there about 
information that was being shared. I completely disagree with that and I think it’s 
important that he does qualify that at the end … I am not saying that there weren’t 
meetings in the evening with the press. I’m sure that they could be found. What I will 
say is that the hours that were being worked through that period between 2005 and 
beyond, even after I retired, were on a scale that no other – none of us in our team 
had experienced before, to the point where fatigue across the team, both junior and 
senior levels, was a regular facet of work.”

Hospitality

5.10  During his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Hayman was taken through a number of entries in 
the MPS gifts and hospitality register and his personal diary concerning his contact with the 
media, particularly in respect of NI personnel, for the period March 2005 to April 2007.799 

5.11  Mr Hayman confirmed that following an offer from the NoTW newspaper he had what was 
described as a working dinner with the journalist Lucy Panton on 8 November 2005.800 His 
attendance was in his capacity as ACSO and he described what might have been discussed:801

“… I can’t be 100 per cent sure about this, but what I can – so I’m in a way speculating, 
but  given  the  timing  of  this  and  it  was  shortly  after  the  attacks,  we  were  keen  – 
sorry, the News of the World were keen to run campaigns to help tackle the threat 
from terrorism. They had some rough ideas of what they wanted to do, and I recall 
trying to guide and give advice on that … So when we talk about working dinner, I 
can’t accurately remember what that was about, but it was certainly in line with my 
recollection that the paper was being proactive about trying to tackle the whole issue 
of this unfolding home-grown threat from terrorism.”

5.12  This working dinner was followed three days later by a meeting at the NoTW offices, again 
with Ms Panton.802 Ms Panton described Mr Hayman as a “work friend” and suggested that 
she had shared “a couple of lunches, a breakfast meeting, coffees and drinks meetings with 
him”.803

5.13  Neil Wallis (Deputy Editor of the NoTW from 2003-2007, and thereafter Executive Editor until 
2009) told the Inquiry that he first met Mr Hayman in 2005 and that they subsequently met 
for a drink about six times a year.804 Mr Wallis suggested that he was able to offer Mr Hayman 
a level of insight into the way the police were interacting with the media, he said:805

“Andy, as I think he said in his evidence to you, was particularly interested in police/
press  relations.  He  had  very  strong  views  on  it.  He  had  views  particularly  in  light 
of ACSO and of the pressure of anti-terrorism operations at the time, and it was of

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGinterest to him, I think – there was a very strong debate, I think, about how much 
of that should be in the public domain and how much should not be in the public 
domain. Now, I have always held the view, both personally and as a journalist, that the 
public deserves to be informed more. However, there was obviously the operational 
constraints …” 

5.14  Mr Wallis explained that Mr Hayman “was interested in how the national media reacted to 
and the effect of the levels of information that would come out”,806 and that Mr Hayman used 
Mr Wallis as a sounding board in this context so that he could provide a view on “how are the 
media reacting to this? What do you think is the reality behind the media perception of that? 
What could we do to change a view, for instance?”807 Mr Wallis suggested that over time he 
became friendly with Mr Hayman and that they enjoyed each others company, to the extent 
that no persuasion was needed when he invited Mr Hayman to meet for a drink, he said 
“well, I never noticed I had to arm-twist him, no.”808 

5.15  Moving forward, Mr Hayman confirmed that he had attended a dinner at the NoTW’s expense 
on 25 April 2006 at Soho House with Andy Coulson and Mr Wallis, at the time editor and 
deputy editor of the paper; Dick Fedorcio also attended.809 Mr Hayman suggested that this 
event may have been organised by Mr Fedorcio to enable him to meet Mr Coulson and Mr 
Wallis for the first time, although he acknowledged that his recollection of what transpired at 
the dinner was not perfect.810 If this was simply an introductory meeting then the timing was 
unfortunate to say the least. Operation Caryatid (which came within Mr Hayman’s command) 
was at this time entering a critical juncture; Detective Chief Superintendant Williams, the 
Senior Investigating Officer for the operation, had sought advice from the CPS on 20 April 
2006 regarding searches at the NoTW, and that advice was provided to the police on the day 
that the dinner took place. The decision was taken to proceed with the investigation on the 
following day, 26 April 2006.811 Mr Hayman confirmed that he had been aware of Operation 
Caryatid at the time of the dinner but not of its possible scope.812 

5.16  Being entertained by the editor and deputy editor of a newspaper which was becoming the 
focus of a criminal investigation was, at its lowest, extremely unwise. I am prepared to accept 
(as everyone involved has made clear) that nothing untoward took place during the course of 
this meal insofar as the police investigation is concerned. Having said that, however, I have no 
doubt that the perception that this social engagement inevitably and understandably created 
has, in fact, damaged the reputation of the MPS in general and Mr Hayman in particular. By 
way of one example only, it has undoubtedly fuelled the expressed perception that the failure 
to pursue Operation Caryatid beyond the prosecution of Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman 
was a specific consequence of that relationship. 

5.17  The same might be said of further meetings which took place with Mr Wallis and Ms Panton 
over the course of the next year. Mr Hayman confirmed that he met alone with Mr Wallis 
for  an  early  evening  meeting  on  24  October  2006  although  he  could  not  recall  what  was 
discussed.813 In addition, he attended a working lunch at a restaurant, Santini’s, with Mr Wallis

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGand Ms Panton on 29 March 2007. Mr Hayman again could not recall the exact purpose of 
the lunch but stressed that nothing inappropriate was discussed.814 The lunch meeting was 
not recorded in the hospitality register for which the public paid; Mr Hayman used the MPS 
American Express card with which he had been provided.815 I appreciate that the criminal 
prosecution had concluded and that the work of engaging with the media had to go on: in the 
light of the events of the previous year and the difficulties that the police had experienced, 
however, with Burton Copeland, it is somewhat surprising that Mr Hayman felt that it was 
appropriate for him to entertain staff of the News of the World to lunch at public expense.

5.18  Two entries for 1 February 2007, again not recorded in the MPS hospitality register, are worthy 
of  particular  note.  The  first  concerned  a  lunch  for  nine  people  at  Shepherd’s  Restaurant. 
Again, payment for the lunch was by Mr Hayman’s MPS American Express card, with the bill 
coming to £566, of which £181.50 was spent on alcohol. Mr Hayman explained that the lunch 
had been to mark the promotion of a colleague and to reward his senior team for their hard 
work and sacrifices during what was evidently a very busy and pressurised period for counter-
terrorism policing.816 Whether or not this was a legitimate expense for the public purse to 
bear is not a matter upon which it is necessary for me to express an opinion; the amount 
spent on alcohol, however, together with the fact that it was not recorded in the relevant 
hospitality register is perhaps illustrative of the culture in place within the MPS at the time. 

5.19  The second entry concerned a Crime Reporters Association business dinner at the Oriel Wine 
Bar and Bistro. During the course of the evening Mr Hayman, again using his MPS American 
Express card, spent £47 on a bottle of champagne for a CRA representative, possibly from 
the NoTW.817 Mr Hayman could not recall who that representative might have been;818 it has 
been suggested that the individual concerned was Lucy Panton, although she denied this in 
her evidence to the Inquiry.819 She did however confirm that on occasions she had shared a 
bottle of champagne with Mr Hayman in a large group setting, such as the CRA Christmas 
party.820 Mr Hayman argued that in his judgment this form of entertainment was legitimate 
given “the work it was producing” in terms of the support from the NoTW for the police’s 
anti-terror campaign.821 

5.20  With all due respect to Mr Hayman, this is not a satisfactory explanation. The risk created by 
this type of social interaction with members of the press in general (and, even more so, with 
one title in particular) created a perception of a relationship that was more than capable 
of undermining public confidence in the Metropolitan Police. The fact that one title (or its 
journalists)  was  being  given  preferential  treatment  not  only  underlines  and  justifies  that 
perception; it also gives rise to a legitimate concern from other journalists that the particular 
title had a special and favoured position in police circles. 

5.21  Mr Hayman attended two further working lunches with Mr Wallis in September and November 
2007, both of which were recorded in the hospitality register, and a CRA lunch with Ms Panton 
in attendance in August 2007, again recorded in the hospitality register.822 Regarding the risk

904

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGthat a perception of impropriety had been created by the level and nature of his contact with 
certain sections of the media, Mr Hayman said this:823

“On reflection and I want to go back and think, well, what was my thinking at the 
time. I was very enthusiastic about the whole national build for counter terrorism. We 
wanted to be much better than we were in 2007, 2005. That meant building a national 
picture,  counter  terrorism  units,  both  covert  and  overt,  across  the  country  from 
scratch. What had to go hand in glove with that was a media strategy, and inevitably 
a lot of that was centred in London because that’s where the hub of the media was. 
So it was nothing but enthusiasm and a … bit hasty, because we didn’t know when the 
next attack was going to come. But the point you’re making in hindsight as we pour 
over this, at the time it was absolutely well intended, honourable, but on reflection I 
can see what people can see.” 

I am not at all sure that hindsight was necessary. To anyone who was acquainted with the 
facts (as Mr Hayman should have been, even if he was not), the risk and the potential danger 
was obvious.

Contract with The Times 

5.22  Mr Hayman told the Inquiry that he first began working for The Times in 2008.824 He explained 
that when it became more widely known that he had retired from the MPS in the middle 
of April 2008, he had received several invitations from both the print media and television 
industry to consider being a commentator on contemporary policing issues.825 To this end he 
sought the help of a specialist agency to represent his position in negotiating any future roles 
and met with an agent.826 

5.23  Mr Hayman said that he was approached by Sean O’Neill, the crime and security editor of 
The Times, and then subsequently was interviewed by the editor and deputy editor of the 
newspaper. Mr Hayman could not be sure of the timing but suggested that it was certainly 
not any earlier than two months after his retirement in April 2008. Following the interview, 
Mr Hayman said that he discussed the opportunity with his agent, compared it with other 
invitations and decided to accept the terms being offered. Mr Hayman confirmed that this 
was shortly followed by employment with ITN, NBC and more latterly LBC.827 

5.24  Mr  O’Neill  described  the  hiring  of  Mr  Hayman  from  his  perspective,  strongly  refuting  the 

suggestion that this was a favour being done by NI for past deeds:828

“… The initiative to contact Andy Hayman was mine, to be honest. He was – I don’t 
think he knows this, but he was second choice. I approached Peter Clarke first of all. 
We had a relatively new editor, he had a new style whereby a news story – he liked 
to have a news story accompanied by a commentary or an analysis, something like 
that. I quite often felt uncomfortable writing the news story and then commenting on 
it, I didn’t think that was appropriate, so I suggested we find an expert commentator. 
We do the same with health, we have a doctor who writes routinely, and I thought it

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGmight be – you know, I knew Clarke and Hayman had retired in fairly quick order, one 
after the other, and we had at the time a huge terror trial going on, the airline plot 
trial, and I thought if there were more terror trials in the pipeline, it would be good 
to get one of these guys to give an expert commentary on terrorism issues and then 
more broadly on policing issues. So it was 2008. Hacking wasn’t in the news, wasn’t 
an issue.”

5.25  Mr O’Neill confirmed that Mr Hayman was paid a £10,000 per annum retainer at The Times,829 
but denied that this was a quid pro quo for any assistance that he may have given to NI whilst 
he was Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations. He said:830

“… I had very limited contact with him, and he had media contracts with ITV News, 
with LBC, with NBC, and we nabbed him just before he signed up – he was being 
pursued by the Daily Telegraph. Frankly now I wish I’d let the Daily Telegraph sign him 
up. It would have been better for him and for us.” 

5.26  Mr Hayman provided the Inquiry with his views on the contract with The Times:831

“… Once I’d retired, I didn’t do an awful lot, just tried to sort of make the transition 
into retirement, and so effectively on paper I wasn’t entering the Yard from December 
2007, and it was towards the beginning of the summer I was approached not by a 
News International outlet, but by someone else, another paper, and also TV outlets 
who were interested to sign me up, as it were. In hindsight I think probably because 
there were a lot of activities going on with trials around terrorism and they would 
want someone to perhaps offer an opinion on it. This was something that I’d never 
really thought would happen, and I therefore went to an agent to get some advice 
and help, and I let the agent deal with all the negotiations. The point that I now find 
out is that News International, the Times … got wind of the other person’s interest 
and then that’s how we ended up having two outlets, as it were, wanting to sign 
me to write. Now, I did give this long thought, and I thought what is the difference 
here – set phone hacking aside just for one minute, if we may. What is the difference 
here between a retired police officer, of which there are others who have written, 
doing commentary and hopefully working alongside a journalist who can do a factual 
journalistic reporting, but a police commentator can give more of an insight to the 
reader, and working hand in glove, that could actually produce some good reportable 
material, which would also enhance this profile and contact with the police as well. I 
made the comparisons in my mind, albeit they’re not directly comparable, between 
sportsmen  who  retire,  maybe  politicians  and  maybe  financiers,  and  I  honestly  did 
not  make  the  connection  that  I  was  embarking,  if  I  made  that  choice  rather  than 
that  choice,  into  a  stable  that  was  part  of  the  News  of  the  World.  I  just  didn’t 
make that connection. I didn’t know the people, didn’t know the editor, the deputy 
editor. I was formally interviewed. Never met them before. Throughout the whole 
relationship, never any hint of trying to exploit what may be my contacts, what may 
be a relationship there. My experience was it was completely above board. However 
… if I had my time again and I was able to make that link, presentationally that is 
difficult and it’s difficult to people to probably in a way believe that account, but that 
is the account as it happened and there are many people who were involved in those

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGnegotiations that I think can corroborate what I’ve said.” 

5.27  Leaving aside whether it is appropriate for a recently retired senior police officer to move 
almost immediately into a role commentating on police operations and practices, again there 
is, as Mr Hayman acknowledged,832 an issue of perception. Mr Hayman confirmed what is 
clearly the reality, namely, that The Times and the NoTW were entirely separate entities and 
made the point that:833

“… I can honestly say I can’t remember in that building bumping into anyone that I 
had professional contact with when I was in the police service.” 

5.28  The problem is neatly evidenced by one particular article written by Mr Hayman that has 
understandably  been  the  cause  of  some  concern.  The  piece,  published  in  The  Times  on 
11 July 2009, was effectively a rebuttal of the Guardian newspaper’s assertion that phone 
hacking had been widespread. To recapitulate, the Guardian article claimed that the police 
file demonstrated that between 2,000 or 3,000 individuals had been the subject of mobile 
phones  hacking  which  was  far  more  than  was  ever  officially  acknowledged  or  mentioned 
by the police during the investigation and eventual prosecution of Glenn Mulcaire and Clive 
Goodman.  Mr  Hayman,  however,  suggested  that  his  recollection  of  events  was  different, 
and that the list of those people targeted, which was put together from records kept by Mr 
Mulcaire, ran to several hundred names. Furthermore, Mr Hayman went on to suggest that of 
those targeted, there was only a small number, perhaps a handful, where there was evidence 
that phones had actually been tampered with.834

5.29  To be clear, Mr Hayman told the Inquiry that when he wrote The Times article he had:835 

“Absolutely no reference to any documents. Indeed, when I left the Met, that would be 
absolutely inappropriate for me to either try and elicit that or have any conversation 
about that. This was on what I understood from my recollection, my general broad 
recollection, of how events were.” 

Mr Hayman suggested that his reference to ‘a handful’ of tampered phones accorded with 
his interpretation of what the evidence had shown and what he had been told at the time.836 
His evidence was that the reference in  his  article to the list of those targeted came from 
his  recollection  of  a  brief  conversation  while  Operation  Caryatid  was  taking  place  with 
Commander John McDowall, who was standing in for the temporarily absent Peter Clarke.837 
Mr Hayman could not recall why Commander McDowall had come to him with the list of 
names and said:838 

“… John was a sort of guy who would just turn up to the office, and if I wasn’t either 
busy  or  in  a  meeting  he  would  probably  then  literally  say  “good  morning”,  “good 
afternoon”. He was a very sort of sociable guy, and he also kept me – I suppose in his 
mind – I don’t know what he was thinking, but I guess he thought he’s been told that 
and he’s briefing me but it wasn’t anything substantial.” 

5.30  As to the substance of what had been said to him by Commander McDowall, Mr Hayman 
conceded  that  it  had  clearly  had  some  impact  on  him  given  that  he  was  able  to  recall  it

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGwithin his Times article some three years later.839 Mr Hayman also agreed that the very fact 
that Commander McDowall had taken the time to raise this with him suggested that it was 
something of importance.840 However, Mr Hayman did not accept that it necessarily followed 
from  what  had  been  said  to  him  that  the  evidence  gathered  by  the  police  at  that  stage 
demonstrated that the practice of phone hacking extended far more widely than the Royal 
Family. He said:841

“… I think the distinction was being drawn at the time between what’s the difference 
between  a  journalist  or  someone  who  works  for  a  journalist  having  telephone 
numbers, which is sensibly an address book, versus it going beyond just an address 
book into something more sinister. And my recollection was this is a number of people 
who could just be part of the address book as opposed to something that had been 
more sinister or attacked.” 

5.31  This account highlights the difficulty of trying retrospectively to analyse interactions of this 
type and any decisions taken thereafter. It would certainly appear odd in the extreme for 
Commander McDowall to have troubled Mr Hayman with such a prosaic piece of information, 
and Mr Hayman himself accepted that “if the judgment there is that that could have been a 
trigger that should have been acted upon, I hear what you say.”842 The unfortunate perception 
created by this episode is exacerbated by the assertion within Mr Hayman’s article that had 
there been phone tampering in other cases, then that would have been investigated by the 
police, as would the slightest hint that others were involved.843 As to this, Mr Hayman said:844 

“Well, they weren’t investigated and I don’t understand – you know, I’ve written that 
as part of an article, and to go back to in that office and that interaction to remember 
why things were or weren’t done, I just can’t do.” 

5.32 

I  deal  with  the  police  approach  to  Operation  Caryatid,  the  analysis  undertaken  and  the 
decisions made in considerable detail elsewhere in this Report.845 There is no doubt, however, 
that The Times article, written by Mr Hayman, led to the perception that a defence of NI 
was more important to him than any proper investigation of the allegations in the Guardian 
article. Whether that perception is justified, however, must be judged in the light of the facts. 
In  particular,  although  high  in  the  chain  of  command  for  this  investigation,  Mr  Hayman’s 
involvement in Operation Caryatid was minimal, as was his level of knowledge of the evidence 
in the possession of the police. By way of example only, at the time that he wrote the article, 
he did not know that the police investigation had obtained information about PIN numbers 
used to gain access to the voicemails of ‘targets’.846 

5.33 

In the light of all the circumstances, I am prepared to accept that with the passing of time, 
the absence of any of the relevant police documentation and his natural allegiance to the 
MPS and his former colleagues, in writing The Times article, Mr Hayman was simply reacting 
peremptorily to the substance of the Guardian article. Unfortunately, in doing so, he helped 
to create the impression that the MPS and its former employees were engaged in deliberate 
obfuscation of the full circumstances surrounding the original phone hacking investigation.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG5.34 

John Yates
John Yates is a former Assistant Commissioner in the MPS. Mr Yates joined in September 
1981 and spent his entire 30 career with that force. Mr Yates told the Inquiry that he was 
promoted to the rank of Assistant Commissioner in 2006 and in April 2009 he became the 
national lead for Counter-Terrorism (CT).847 Mr Yates confirmed that he resigned from the 
Police Service in July 2011 and officially left on 7 November of that year.848 Given the context 
to this Module of the Inquiry, it is important to point out (as Mr Yates confirmed) that he had 
no role in relation to any aspect of counter terrorism during the period of the investigation in 
Operation Caryatid, that is to say from its inception in 2005 to the sentencing of Mr Goodman 
and Mr Mulcaire in January 2007. He therefore played no part in the original investigation 
and had no direct or personal knowledge of the facts.849 

5.35  Using his experience of the culture of relations between the MPS and the media over the 
years, Mr Yates suggested that for the vast majority of the time there had been a healthy 
and transparent relationship at all levels.850 Mr Yates told the Inquiry that, in his view, that 
relationship would include more informal transactions, such as lunch or dinner with individual 
journalists.851  Mr  Yates  described  how  he  ensured  that  those  more  informal  transactions 
remained healthy and transparent:852

“It’s a matter for one’s professional judgment and discretion. The vast majority of my 
dealings with the media would be around the sort of strategic policy issues that I was 
exposed to in my service at the senior rank. So in terms of the big issues of the day, 
be it counter terrorism legislation, be it data retention, be it rape policy, for which I 
was responsible nationally for a number of years, the very vast majority would be 
around that … I think there’s a great value in that in terms of both educating myself, 
testing hypotheses, testing views, and getting the views back as well, so the last thing 
I think we would want is policing to be in a bubble and in a vacuum where one isn’t 
connecting to other thinking.”

5.36  Mr  Yates  explained  that  the  nature  of  the  roles  and  investigations  he  had  been  asked  to 
undertake  meant  that  he  had  received  significant  exposure  into  how  all  sections  of  the 
mainstream  media  interacted  with  the  police.853  Mr  Yates  described  how  he  had  often 
become the “public face”854 for policing and policy matters, and that he considered that the 
media were seeking, through their contact with him, fully to understand the context around 
policing issues or particular events.855 As to whether this might be a slightly naïve or benign 
view of the media’s expectation of their dealings with him, Mr Yates said this:856

“No … because I do think many of those dealings, the vast majority, as I said, had 
been around understanding the context. If you take, for example, the government’s 
desire  to  legislate  around  data  retention  and  the  use  of  police  data  in  its  general

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGsense, there was a fundamental misunderstanding about how important that was. So 
if you have the opportunity to explain that and explain the full context and the value 
of those sort of issues, then I think I’m doing it in what I believe, and I still believe, was 
in the best interests of the public and the best interests of policing.”

5.37  The level of Mr Yates’ contact with the media was the cause of some comment. As Mr Yates 
himself  admits,  on  becoming  the  head  of  counter-terrorism  within  the  MPS,  the  Security 
Services  were  “understandably  concerned”  about  the  degree  of  his  media  contact  in  his 
previous  roles.857  Mr  Yates  suggested  that  this  concern  arose  in  part  because  of  “all  the 
briefing against me in the cash for honours investigation”,858 and that once they saw how he 
worked in his new role he felt that the Security Services knew “any such concerns were clearly 
unfounded”.859 

5.38  Mr Yates also confirmed that Tim Godwin, the then Deputy Commissioner, had advised him, 
as he did other management board members, to reduce his contact with the media.860 Mr 
Yates accepted that this advice was of particular relevance to him given his ‘establishing the 
facts’ role in the developing phone hacking story,861 and said:862

“… I think it was generally well-known and by many people in a perfectly proper way 
that I had and had had good relationships with the media going back a number of 
years, so it was very well known and, as I say, but I absolutely accept what you’re 
saying in terms of it may have been directed to me than, say, the director of resources.” 

5.39  When asked about his advice to Mr Yates, Mr Godwin told the Inquiry:863 

“I thought at a point when, having become the Deputy Commissioner, I thought the 
frequency of those meetings and the manner of those meetings could be misinterpreted 
and the perception would be wrong, and as a result I did disapprove at that point.” 

Both Mr Godwin and Mr Yates sought to explain this disagreement as a difference in style 
rather than a difference in values insofar as interaction with the media was concerned. Mr 
Yates said:864

“I think Tim was of the view that the media were the enemy and we shouldn’t be in 
contact with them. Now, I don’t concur with that view, never have done, and I’ve had 
some healthy dialogue, debate, with Tim on those points. He took it [sic] a different 
view to me and others.” 

5.40  Mr Godwin sought to elaborate on this point and said:865

“I think … to be fair we pretty much had common values about honesty, integrity in 
terms of conduct … I think the difference, with respect, would be that there was one

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGstyle that was favoured by some members of the management board of the Met and 
there was another style, which was my style, where I didn’t feel comfortable in that 
environment. So I wouldn’t say it’s a values difference, it’s a difference of style.” 

5.41  This difference in style and approach has been evident during the course of the Inquiry. Mr 
Godwin  accepted  the  organisational  difficulties  which  flowed  from  maintaining  a  position 
whereby very senior police officers were each able to develop their own unique, and perhaps 
conflicting, relationship with the media, and said:866

“…  I  think  that  as  a  result  of  this  Inquiry  and  as  a  result  of  the  events  as  they 
unfolded last year in the Metropolitan Police whilst I was still there and as the Acting 
Commissioner, we did actually take action to make sure that we had a common style 
in  terms  of  our  interaction  with  the  media.  I  think  in  those  days  about  openness, 
transparency, not wanting to be seen as in a siege mentality scenario, as has been 
the case in the past, I think there were different styles as to how we could be open, 
transparent, approachable, accountable, and as a result of that, there were different 
styles that developed. But the values of the organisation were still the same in terms 
of honesty, integrity, value human rights, et cetera.”

5.42  Mr Godwin’s view, and it is one that I fully share, was that the inherent danger in adopting Mr 
Yates’ approach or style in relation to his interaction with the media was that it created the 
potential for a reputational risk and, in particular, the prospect of having to face suggestions 
of impropriety, such as leaking to the press, however ill-founded the suggestions might be. 
This mandated Mr Godwin’s own approach to his interactions with the media. He told the 
Inquiry:867

“I think I was more concerned about the perceptions where you have media stories 
that are gossip stories or embarrassing stories or leaks, then the sheer fact that you’ve 
engaged  in  that  sort  of  behaviour  does  make  you  vulnerable  to  being  accused  of 
misconduct, et cetera, so I thought that that was probably not the right environment, 
but that was purely a style issue for me … Naturally it would follow that those that 
are frequently meeting with the press, frequently engaging in social events with the 
media, would be the ones that would automatically be looked at as potential sources 
… But obviously they may well not be, of course.” 

Hospitality and News International

5.43  Mr Yates explained that he accepted hospitality, mainly in the form of lunch or dinner, from 
the media in accordance with the relevant MPS guidance of the time, and that it was declared 
in the Hospitality and Gifts register.868 Mr Yates went on to explain that this “would not include 
any occasion when I met casually with a journalist and drinks and coffee were bought on a 
reciprocal basis”,869 so it would be accurate to say that the register only recorded a proportion 
of Mr Yates’ social contact with the media. Mr Yates told the Inquiry that an arrangement to 
have lunch or dinner or attend a social function was “considered perfectly acceptable and 
had many benefits.”870 Mr Yates confirmed that it was his practice to drink alcohol on these

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGoccasions in sensible quantities, which (as he accurately pointed out) was perfectly acceptable 
under the hospitality guidance in place at the time.871

5.44 

It is right to record that Mr Yates’ contact with the media was not limited to NI or NoTW 
personnel; there were a large number of meetings with other sections of the media.872 In 
relation to NI more generally, Mr Yates told the Inquiry that he had never met James Murdoch 
or Rupert Murdoch.873 He recalled twice being a guest at Rebekah Brooks’ table at the Police 
Bravery Awards, which were sponsored by The Sun, and he may also have had lunch with her 
at The Sun together with the newspaper’s crime editor in January 2009.874 Mr Yates recalled 
meeting  Andy  Coulson  for  the  first  time  in  late  2009  at  the  Evening  Standard  1000  Most 
Influential Londoners Event, by which time Mr Coulson was the Director of Communications 
for the Conservative Party. 

Neil Wallis

5.45  Neil Wallis and Mr Yates were friends. Mr Yates accepts that Mr Wallis was a “good friend”875 
of his, and his diary recorded a number of private appointments with Mr Wallis, Nick Candy, a 
property developer, and (on occasions) a friend who worked in PR.876 An example of this type 
of contact was dinner at a restaurant called Scalini’s on 3 June 2009.877 Mr Yates explained 
that the purpose of these occasions was “to go out with friends and enjoy a dinner”, and that 
they were purely social events.878 Mr Yates’ evidence was that on this particular occasion Mr 
Candy paid for the meal although “there were many times I paid for dinner.”879 

5.46  Mr Yates also confirmed that on two or three occasions he had attended a football match 
with Mr Wallis.880 He fairly accepted that there would have been some discussion in relation 
to their professional lives in the margins of these social encounters881, but said that:882

“As I say, completely in the margins. Of course there must have been, but … I know a 
number of lawyers, and count them as good friends, and we can talk about the legal 
system without talking about particular cases. I know bankers, you can talk about 
banking systems and not talk about individual accounts. You’d have to accept there’s 
a sort of element of professionalism and sound judgment that stops you going into 
areas where you shouldn’t go into, and … the inferences shouldn’t be there.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG5.47  Mr Wallis for his part told the Inquiry that he first encountered Mr Yates when he had been 
a staff officer to Lord Condon, and that over the years he had come to regard him as a good 
friend.883 He said that:884

“We socialised together by attending football matches and we shared in common 
a keen interest of sport in general, lived in a similar area of West London, we had 
families of a similar age and we got on very well.” 

Mr  Wallis  described  how  he  was  enlisted  by  Mr  Yates  to  help  to  formulate  an  anti-rape 
campaign, sponsored by the NoTW, in order to publicise the good work being carried out by 
Mr Yates in his role as ACPO lead on this area, although he insisted that it was not done as a 
means of showcasing him.885 

5.48  When asked about the private dinners with Mr Yates and Mr Candy, Mr Wallis reiterated that 
the discussions  did not stray into policing matters. He suggested that Mr Candy was “not 
interested in the police”886 and they tended to discuss issues of the day, sport and current 
affairs.887 Mr Wallis also refuted any suggestions that, on the occasions that Mr Candy was 
not present, he and Mr Yates discussed the internal politics of the management board of the 
MPS.888 

5.49  The transparency or otherwise of Mr Yates’ relationship with Mr Wallis was the subject of 
some debate. Dick Fedorcio described his understanding of the nature of their friendship as 
follows:889

“… I was aware that they knew each other. I was aware that they got on quite well. I 
understood their contact to be mainly work. I was aware of what I would call sort of 
banter between them over football matters. Occasionally, John would show me a text 
that he’d received from Neil Wallis, which would have been passing comment, shall 
we say, on a recent football result, which Liverpool, John’s team he supported, had 
played in. So I was aware of that sort of interaction. Through that, I think I was aware 
that on one occasion they went to a football match together, but I couldn’t say when 
I heard that or where it was.”

He considered that they had developed a business friendship and “that they’d once been to a 
match together. But beyond that, I wasn’t aware of anything else that took place.”890

5.50  Mr Fedorcio therefore expressed some surprise to have read about the extent of the out-of-
hours contact between Mr Wallis and Mr Yates, indicating that “it was a revelation to me.”891 
Mr Fedorcio suggested that it would have been helpful for him to have been aware of this 
level of personal contact in his capacity as the Director of Public Affairs, not least because of

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGhis need to be kept informed of issues that might create a reputational risk for the MPS.892 
Given his lack of knowledge of the level of personal contact between Mr Wallis and Mr Yates 
and with an eye to the future, Mr Fedorcio said this:893

“… I didn’t think that I would expect to know people’s personal contact, if that sort 
of thing was going on … I mean, at the time I didn’t, and I didn’t think really of it, but 
I look at it now and say, “That’s the sort of information I think that the Met should 
know from senior people, and that people in my job perhaps should know as well”, 
especially if it’s a relationship with the media.”

5.51  Similarly, Sara Cheesley told the Inquiry that during a number of conversations with Mr Yates 
the impression was given by Mr Yates that he saw Mr Wallis a “few times a year” but that he 
didn’t class him as a “very close friend”.894 Mr Yates, on the other hand, suggested that Mr 
Fedorcio would have been aware of the extent of his friendship with Mr Wallis, he said:895 

“… I would absolutely know that Dick would know that Neil and I would be fighting 
about football and that would be absolutely in his knowledge, I would have thought.” 

As to the level of his social contact with Mr Wallis, Mr Yates said that he would “imagine”896 
that Mr Fedorcio would have been aware, and said “there’s nothing I’m trying to hide around 
it. It’s in my diary, even a private appointment.”897 Sir Paul Stephenson, Commissioner during 
the relevant period, explained that he:898

“… knew Mr Yates was a friend of Mr Wallis. I can’t in all honesty say I knew the 
extent of the friendship, but I did know he was a friend, yes.”

Lucy Panton

5.52  Mr Yates told the Inquiry that he had known Ms Panton professionally for about 10 years 
and “was on very good terms with her, I also considered her a friend.”899 He said that she 
was married to a Metropolitan Police officer and he had been a guest at their wedding. He 
described Ms Panton as:900 

“… one of the most active members of the Crime Reporters’ Association (CRA) and 
was one of the reporters that followed every major crime-related story.” 

Mr Yates said that as a consequence Ms Panton “had regular dealings with the police at a 
number of levels, including with me.”901

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG5.53  He  said  that  like  most  senior  journalists  working  in  this  area,  Ms  Panton  had  his  mobile 
telephone number and sometimes called him directly if there was a matter or an issue that 
she wanted to discuss.902 Mr Yates said that he occasionally met Ms Panton for a drink, as 
he  did  other  journalists,  and  that  sometimes  he  met  her  on  her  own  but  more  normally 
with several other journalists, press officers and other police officers present; and that Mr 
Fedorcio, in his capacity as Director of Public Affairs, was nearly always there.903

5.54  Ms Panton could not recall exactly when she had first met Mr Yates but estimated that “it 
would have been about a decade ago when I was on the Sunday People, and it would have 
been at briefings at the Yard in a group crime reporter setting.”904 Ms Panton confirmed that 
Mr Yates had been a guest at her wedding “along with many other police officers”,905 and 
given this fact described the nature of their relationship:906

“There were a few people at my wedding who I would class as working friends, who 
I did socialise with outside of work, and Mr Yates falls into that category. I certainly 
got on well with him. I had a good rapport with him, but we didn’t socialise outside of 
work. The wedding was the only occasion. There were a lot of people at my wedding.” 

5.55 

Interestingly, and despite this ‘working friendship’, Ms Panton was clear that she regarded all 
police officers she knew as “confidential contacts”.907 This is obviously understandable given 
her job as a journalist but does appear to reaffirm the requirement for complete transparency 
in the relationship between the police and the press so that there can never be any question 
of impropriety in respect of either side. This requirement becomes all the more apparent 
when examining some of the interaction between Mr Yates and Ms Panton. 

5.56  There were a number of examples of both recorded and un-recorded contact between Mr 
Yates and Ms Panton in a more social setting.908 On 5 November 2009, Mr Yates attended a 
dinner meeting with Colin Myler, then Editor of the NoTW, and Ms Panton at the Ivy Club 
restaurant.909 The entry within the gifts and hospitality register suggests that the dinner was 
to “improve understanding of each other’s operational environment.”910 It appears that this 
formulation was one commonly used in the register where senior officers were meeting with 
a news organisation. Mr Yates said:911 

“… I had nothing to do with the formal words, but that was the formal words that 
appeared to sort of encapsulate it and satisfy the police authority.” 

The Ivy Club is one of the more exclusive and expensive restaurants in London. Despite this, 
Mr Yates maintained that this interaction was appropriate at the time that it took place, he 
said:912

“…  I  mean,  in  terms  of  what  we  know  now,  yes  …  as  I  say,  in  terms  of  what  has 
happened in the last three or four months, yes, I suppose it is [inappropriate], but it

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGcertainly wasn’t at the time in terms of what we knew about the events, Mr Myler’s 
position, he was the new editor who’d come in, and I go back to what I said at the 
start. I think it’s hugely important that senior police officers have a relationship and 
interact with the media, that they are not the enemy, they are occasionally critical 
friends and occasionally much worse.” 

5.57  The importance of perception in this context and the potential damage that can be done 
to an individual or organisation’s reputation is perhaps best illustrated by an internal NoTW 
email  which  was  produced  in  evidence  to  the  Inquiry.913  The  email,  sent  on  30  October 
2010, was from James Mellor, then the number two on the news desk at the NoTW, to Ms 
Panton.914 The email related to the Al-Qaeda inkjet plot, and conveyed Mr Mellor’s view that 
Mr Yates could be crucial in helping to corroborate the facts around the story.915 Within the 
email Mr Mellor asks Ms Panton whether she had yet spoken to Mr Yates and suggests that 
the newspaper really needed an “exclusive splash line”,916 and so it was time “to call in all 
those bottles of champagne.”917 The inference is obvious. Ms Panton provided her view on 
the email’s contents:918

“I don’t think it was necessarily light-hearted. I think he was putting pressure on me 
to get a story. I would call that banter. It’s the way that people spoke to each other 
in the office. I would read that at that time as banter mixed with a bit of pressure.”

5.58  Metaphorical or otherwise, and Ms Panton denied the reference to be true,919 the use of the 
term “call in all those bottles of champagne” does at least appear to convey a perception 
within the editorial staff of the NoTW that Ms Panton’s relationship with Mr Yates enabled 
her quickly to obtain information from him. As to this, Ms Panton said:920

“I think they hoped that you would be able to ring these people up and … bring in 
exclusives every week. The reality is they know that doesn’t happen, unfortunately, 
otherwise  we  would  have  had  bigger  and  better  crime  stories  than  we  did.  My 
recollection of this is that I did phone Mr Yates and I don’t believe I actually got to 
speak to him. That was the reality, week in, week out.” 

5.59  Despite being unable to contact Mr Yates in this instance, Ms Panton did admit that he would 
have been her first port of call within the Police Service if she were looking for somebody 
to provide her with the material to assist in producing an exclusive splash line.921 Mr Yates 
provided the context to the email:922

“… the background is the weekend of that 30 October was – I think it was about two 
or three days beforehand there had been a printer cartridge bomb found on a DHL 
flight up in the West Midlands Airport, so there was a lot of interest around what had 
happened that weekend.”

916

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGAs to the contents of the email itself, Mr Yates strongly refuted the inference that his receipt 
of hospitality from the NoTW previously meant that he was in some way beholden to them, 
saying:923

“… firstly I have no clue who James Mellor is, I never met him in my life. Secondly, it’s 
not my e-mail and it’s a turn of phrase, and thirdly, it would indicate even by October 
2010 that those perceived favours had never been called and I hadn’t provided them 
with anything before and that’s the position …”

5.60  Mr Yates also reiterated the point made by her that he “hadn’t been plied with champagne by 
Lucy Panton”;924 although he did admit to drinking champagne with Ms Panton on occasions, 
and said that:925

“… there may well have been the very odd occasion, yes, when a bottle was being 
shared with several people …” 

He denied any impropriety.926 In the light of the evidence, I am prepared to accept that nothing 
untoward actually took place but this level of interaction does add to the perception that Mr 
Yates had developed an overly close relationship with NI and he should not be surprised if 
concern is expressed that perception quite frequently represents or can lead to reality.

A perception of bias

5.61  This  Report  contains  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  reconsideration  of  Operation  Caryatid 
undertaken by Mr Yates in 2009 and subsequently.927 Although somewhat repetitive, at this 
stage,  it  is  also  appropriate  to  deal  with  the  allegation  that  Mr  Yates’  friendship  with  Mr 
Wallis  and  Ms  Panton  (along  with  whatever relationship  he  had  with  NoTW)  affected  the 
way in which he went about making decisions as more and more allegations were publicly 
advanced. 

5.62  First and foremost, Mr Yates accepted that the general thrust of the article in the Guardian in 
July 2009 was to the effect that phone hacking involved a conspiracy which embraced others 
at the NoTW and one which possibly went quite high up in that organisation.928 Furthermore, 
it is also correct to note that, at the time of the events, his friend Neil Wallis was the deputy 
editor of the paper and at the time of the article, he was the executive editor.929 Given these 
facts, it might be argued that it was inadvisable for Mr Yates to have been involved in any way 
in any exercise of review, reconsideration or reflection upon Operation Caryatid: in short, it 
can be said that he was simply too close to at least one person who, involved or not, was 
at the very centre of the organisation. Mr Yates explained why in his view this was not the 
case:930

“Well, you might as well ask that to the Commissioner as well and others who knew 
full well that I had a relationship with Neil Wallis, and, you know, I was looking at 
this dispassionately from the evidential perspective and I had people advising me on

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthat, and we went through an exercise, and we got to the point we got to. To suggest 
that I would be influenced otherwise … is wrong. You know, you’re talking to a person 
… who investigated serving government on which the Home Secretary has the final 
say on my career. I have a reputation and a track record of doing difficult things and 
doing them in a dispassionate and evidence-based way and that’s exactly what I did 
in this case.” 

5.63  This may all be true in substance although there is a real difference, in my view, between 
investigating a government minister (who is then unlikely to be allowed ‘the final say on [his] 
career’) and investigating an organisation at which a personal friend holds a relevant and 
senior position who may be affected. Having said that, however, and irrespective of how ill-
judged some of those decisions might have been,931 I have heard no evidence that, in fact, 
any of the decisions taken by Mr Yates were influenced by his relationship with Mr Wallis or 
more broadly with staff at NI.

5.64  That is not an end to the matter, because I have no doubt that there is and has been a clear 
perception that the decisions made by Mr Yates may have been affected by these relationships. 
Furthermore, that perception has proved to be extremely damaging both to the professional 
standing of Mr Yates and to the reputation of the MPS. Neither is this a small matter. Lord 
Blair suggested that the issue of public perception should form part of the police decision 
making process when determining who should lead on a particular investigation or matter of 
contention, and certainly where personal friendships are in play.932 He said:933 

“… I think it’s at that point one has to consider whether somebody else should make 
the decision. I mean, as an example, and it was a term of art only lawyers would 
know, I discovered the word “recuse”, and I commented on that in relation to cash 
for  honours,  that  I  recused  myself  from  the  decision-making  process  because  I 
was meeting the people involved on a very regular basis in the shape of the Prime 
Minister and other senior ministers. It’s a very difficult place if you were trying to 
make decisions.” 

Assistant Commissioner Dick made a similar point and suggested that where potential issues 
of personal conflict arise, then that fact should at least be the subject of discussion at the 
appropriate level before any final decision on who led a piece of work was taken.934 In relation 
to this particular case, and with the acknowledged benefit of hindsight, Ms Dick said:935 

“… I do think that he should – looking back, I think – certainly, we wouldn’t be sitting 
here in this manner if he had gone and discussed this in more detail, perhaps, with 
Sir Paul. I don’t know how much Sir Paul knew about the relationship, but I think at a 
minimum, a conflict like that should be discussed …” 

5.65  Sir Paul acknowledged that at the time that he tasked Mr Yates with the establishment of the 

facts exercise following the 9 July 2009 Guardian article he:936 

“… didn’t connect it with Mr Wallis. I didn’t give it any particular thought …”

918

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGAs to whether he would have expected Mr Yates to have appreciated this issue of ‘conflict’ 
and raised it with him, Sir Paul said:937

“Well, I would expect Mr Yates to consider – if he felt in any way conflicted, to have 
reflected it back to me, or done what any other chief constable around the country 
would do, including provincial forces, where if you can’t put it somewhere [else], you 
are “it”. There are various devices one can put in place to ensure that any conflict of 
interest doesn’t become an issue.”

5.66  Given the subject matter of the exercise to be undertaken following the Guardian article, on 
the face of it it was logical to have asked Mr Yates to deal with it. He was not, however, the 
only choice available to Sir Paul: there were a number of other very senior police officers 
at his disposal. Sir Paul explained his likely reaction in the event that Mr Yates had asked to 
recuse himself from the exercise because of his friendship with Mr Wallis:938

“Had he come back to me with this, I might have done [given the task to another 
officer], or … he had a very large business group. I might have expected him to get 
somebody  within  his  business  group  to  deal  with  it  and  ensure  there  could  be  no 
allegations  of  impropriety  against  him.  I  do  have  to  say  –  this  is  hypothesis  and 
we’re speculating just a little … that probably Mr Yates would have felt that he was 
more than equipped to deal with it. It is not as if, in our professional lives, that we 
don’t actually, as chief constables and senior officers, investigate people who have 
been friends, and to actually say somebody else has to deal with it would almost be 
saying that I do not have sufficient integrity to deal with it. Whether, with hindsight, 
it might have been wise to do that, I think that’s an entirely different question. I can 
understand why he didn’t do it, but with hindsight it might have been wise.” 

5.67 

I  entirely  agree  with  Sir  Paul’s  analysis  in  hindsight,  although  I  think  that  to  focus  on  the 
sufficiency of Mr Yates’ integrity in this matter rather misses the point. Given the allegations 
in the Guardian article, this was very much more than an investigation which might implicate 
someone who has been a friend. One of the main concerns of the article was the role of the 
Metropolitan Police and this, therefore, was an important reputational issue. The additional 
potential  risk  of  further  damage  created  by  the  perception  that  any  reconsideration  was 
being conducted by ‘a friend’ became all the more important. Sir Paul now accepts this to be 
true and he offered this explanation of his thinking and that of the MPS at the time:939

“… there clearly was a perception of risk … But I would come back – the reason for 
giving – it’s a little too grand to call it analysis, but some level of thinking around why I 
think we might have got this wrong, that defensive mindset – I suspect that defensive 
mindset set in very early, for all the reasons I outlined, that stopped us going back and 
challenging what was the reason for the original investigation stopping short, albeit 
we didn’t know it stopped short. I think that is the more likely reason why Mr Yates 
didn’t decide that he had a conflict or not.” 

5.68 

In fairness to Mr Yates, I believe that he does now also recognise this point:940 

“… I think the benefit of hindsight once again comes into play because in July 2009 
there was nothing to suggest that Wallis was involved in any way whatsoever, and

919

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGwhat’s happened in the last few year [sic], and of course nothing has been proven yet, 
but in July 2009 … there was no indication at all, and I did this very dispassionately, 
and I take your point about the perception, but it didn’t appear to me to be a problem 
then and it didn’t appear to others to be a problem then. It is clearly a problem now … 
and I accept that … I completely take that as a perception, but what this was on July 9, 
2009, was a newspaper article. It didn’t present evidence. Newspaper articles as we 
all know, can have basis in facts and they can have lots of flour [sic] put around them 
to make them more interesting. I can only go on what the evidence was that day and 
that’s where I got to.”

5.69  This  comment  tends  to  assume  that  what  was  being  challenged  (namely  the  extent  of 
the involvement of others at NoTW) was not the case because the article did not provide 
evidence that it was so (as opposed to identifying potential lines of enquiry back into the 
original  material).  Further,  the  view  of  others  (including  the  Commissioner)  depends  on 
precisely how much they knew of the relationship and friendships. Taken in the round, and 
given, in particular, his friendship with Mr Wallis and Ms Panton, it is very difficult to avoid 
the conclusion that Mr Yates ought to have recused himself from any exercise whether to 
establish the facts or to consider whether the article justified revisiting the original material 
revealed by Operation Caryatid in 2009 and thereafter. A perception was clearly created that 
the decisions made by Mr Yates were affected by his relationship with NI personnel, and whilst 
the evidence that I have heard does not bear that out (and I am happy to make that clear)941 
the damage done to the reputation of the MPS as a consequence has been significant. 

Sir Paul Stephenson

5.70  Sir Paul joined the Lancashire Constabulary in 1975 and, having worked his way through the 
ranks, was appointed Chief Constable of that force in 2002. Sir Paul joined the MPS as Deputy 
Commissioner in March 2005, and was appointed as Commissioner in January 2009.942 He 
was  Deputy  Commissioner  at  the  time  of  Operation  Caryatid  but  played  no  role  in  that 
investigation. At the time of the publication of the Guardian phone hacking article in July 
2009, he was travelling to the North of England to attend a conference and he spoke to Mr 
Yates on the telephone asking him to undertake an exercise to establish the facts; this was 
not an unusual reaction to articles in the press and although he received periodic updates 
from Mr Yates thereafter, there is no suggestion that he was personally involved in any of 
the decisions that were made. For reasons that will be examined, Sir Paul gave notice of his 
intention to resign from the MPS on 17 July 2011 and formally left office on 26 July 2011.943

5.71  Sir  Paul  described  his  personal  contact  with  the  media  as  taking  the  form  of  meetings, 
functions and attendance at events run by various organisations such as the CRA. He would 
also  on  occasions  meet  with  editors  at  drinks  receptions  or  for  meetings  over  lunch  or 
dinner.944 In relation to his dealings with the media, Sir Paul explained how he ensured that 
the interaction remained healthy without it becoming an overt attempt to garner favour:945

“… I think you do it by being honest, by being as open as you can. Actually, without 
wishing to sound too pompous, by remembering sort of known seven principles of

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGpublic life: honesty, openness, leadership, accountability, selflessness, integrity and 
objectivity. They’re not bad guidelines about how we should have a relationship with 
the media, and by having that dialogue, by trying to ensure that there is a context 
there,  so  when  editors  and  journalists  are  reporting  they  can  refer  back  to  that 
context, and actually trying to give the message that there’s 50-odd thousand people 
working for the Met, most of whom strive to do a very good job, so having some 
balance in the headlines is a fair thing to asked [sic] for.”

5.72 

It  was  Sir  Paul’s  perception  that  he  did  not  favour  any  particular  section  of  the  media,946 
although  he  admitted  that  there  were  complaints  from  journalists  about  the  amount  of 
access to him they were given.947 As to this, Sir Paul suggested that:948

“… I think if you look at the … whole range of my engagement with the media, I think 
it will be difficult to make that allegation in terms of the way in which I divided my 
time.” 

Sir  Paul  confirmed  that  during  his  tenure  as  Deputy  Commissioner  there  were  very  few 
interactions with the press and none, in fact, with NI.949 Sir Paul explained that this was, in 
part, due to his lack of any previous background in the MPS; he said:950 

“ … I think we have to remember that I was this – I hesitate to say exotic creature from 
the provinces suddenly arrived in London who nobody really knew, and it was quite a 
novelty having a deputy commissioner without any Metropolitan Police background 
or  indeed  any  connectivity.  So  that  might  explain  why  I  met  fewer people;  I  knew 
fewer people.”

5.73  The  MPS  gifts  and  hospitality  register  records  that  Sir  Paul’s  interaction  with  the  media 
slowly gathered pace as he moved towards taking the post of Commissioner.951 On becoming 
Commissioner in 2009, Sir Paul suggested that there was “no hiding place”952 in his dealings 
with the media and he began what he described as a strategy to acquaint himself with editors 
in different sections of the press.953 To provide a flavour of the level of Sir Paul’s engagement 
with the media in 2009, he confirmed, for example, that he met with the editor of the Sunday 
Telegraph on 19 February; he had drinks with the editor of the Daily Telegraph on 10 March; 
he met with the Mirror Group on 18 March and with the editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail on 
24 March. On 20 April, he had lunch with the editor of The Sun (at that stage Rebekah Wade, 
as she then was) in Wapping and on 28 April with Mr Witherow of The Sunday Times. There 
was a business dinner with Mr Myler, editor of the NoTW, on 14 May and a News Corporation 
reception at OXO Tower on 17 June. On 27 June, there was a meeting with Richard Littlejohn 
and Stephen Wright of the Daily Mail.954

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG5.74  The rest of that year followed a similar pattern with Sir Paul meeting with the majority of the 
national press,955 apart from the Northern & Shell titles, the Daily Express and the Star. As to 
this omission, Sir Paul explained:956

“It’s certainly not through any design … I would certainly be guided by the head of 
[DPA], Mr Fedorcio, and my Chief of Staff as to who I should meet and when I should 
meet them. I can’t think why we didn’t meet with the editor of the Daily Express but 
it’s not something that I would go through and monitor and audit. But it does seem 
to me, when I look at it, it was generally a broad spread, but it does seem to me 
they’re absent. I did know the crime reporter from the Daily Express and met him 
quite a number of times, but he was quite a senior member of the Crime Reporters 
Association.” 

5.75  Sir Paul suggested that the reason for the sheer number of meetings with the media in the 
early part of his Commissionership was to enable him to introduce himself and his ideas to 
some very important opinion makers and commentators.957 He added to this and said:958 

“… I think I would be a little naïve if I thought that one meeting alone would suffice for 
my entire commissionership. I think some reinforcement is necessary in re-meeting 
[sic] various people because, whilst I might have an agenda in terms of how I saw the 
context of policing, I would then be conscious that editors would have their own views 
and that re-engagement was useful …”

I can readily understand why this would have been a valuable exercise for Sir Paul, however, 
given the level of contact, there is the associated risk of a view being formed that there was, 
at least, the potential for too close a relationship with the media developing.

5.76  Sir Paul recognised this potential double-edged sword, but made a further entirely reasonable 

point when he said:959

“There is a risk of perception … That I will acknowledge. But I find it difficult to see 
how the Commissioner could do his job or her job properly without engaging pretty 
heavily with the media at the right level because if the reportage of the story of the 
Met continues to be unbalanced, which very often it is, then I have a duty on behalf of 
the 50,000-odd people I lead to try and continue to [affect] that balance to be a fairer 
balance and a more accurate balance.” 

5.77  Similarly, Sir Paul rejected any suggestion that the level of his contact with the media was, 
in some way, an attempt to seek to reduce the number of negative headlines and stories 
published relating to the MPS; he said:960

“…  My  experience  of  the  media  is  one  could  have  a  perfectly  good  and  decent 
relationship with an editor, but if there was bad news, there was bad news, and they 
would  report  it  anyway  …  if  you’d  done  something  wrong, if  you’d  got  something 
wrong, that same paper would report it. It would be naïve to think otherwise.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG5.78  This  evidence  serves  to  underline  the  difficult  tightrope  that  Commissioners  of  Police  for 
the Metropolis have to walk. On the one hand, engagement with the press is an important 
part of the job for all the reasons that Sir Paul (and other Commissioners) have given. On the 
other hand, great care must be taken to ensure that the line is not crossed not only because 
of the possibility that a perception of proximity might be created but also because of the 
importance of providing an appropriate example to other ranks within the police service. 

News International and Neil Wallis

5.79  Sir  Paul  stated  that  approximately  30%  of  his  engagements  with  media  figures  were  with 
NI representatives, at a time when NI commanded some 42% of the total United Kingdom 
newspaper readership.961 Sir Paul said that he had met James Murdoch twice and Rupert 
Murdoch once. He met both James and Rupert Murdoch at a NI drinks party which was also 
attended by senior members of the Government, including the Prime Minister; he said that 
his conversation with James Murdoch at this function amounted to no more than cursory 
greetings.962 Dick Fedorcio advised Sir Paul which functions of this sort he should attend and 
was present alongside Sir Paul on this occasion.963 Sir Paul’s list of meetings and engagements 
with the media record that during his tenure as Commissioner he had a meal once or twice 
with the editor of each NI title964; he also had lunch with Rebekah Brooks, then Chief Executive 
of NI, in 2010.965

5.80  Sir Paul recalled that he first met Mr Wallis, who was at that time deputy editor of the NoTW, 
in  September  2006.966  A  number  of  social  or  semi-social  interactions  followed  this  initial 
meeting,967 generally with Mr Fedorcio present; Sir Paul suggested that through these initial 
interactions  he  came  to  know  Mr  Wallis  “I  think  in  the  same  way  that  you’ll  see  …  other 
media representatives I’ve met several times, that I’m getting to know them better.”968 Sir Paul 
described the type of issues that would be discussed on one of these occasions:969

“… from a professional perspective, it would be about the context of policing, the way 
in which government policy might affect policing, the issues around resourcing, all 
the sort of things that one would wish to ensure that when people are reporting on 
policing, there was at least a context, a background, so they could judge in a fair and 
balanced way. I think it was that, but there would also be some social interaction as 
well, as there would be with anybody else I would meet.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG5.81  As  has  become  clear,  Mr  Wallis  was  known  to  previous  Commissioners,970  and  Sir  Paul 
considered him to be a “good contact”,971 because he was a “commentator on how the Met 
looked.”972 As Sir Paul explained, one of his purposes for seeking to engage with the media 
was:973

“… to continually seek feedback of how does the Met look. How do you see us at this 
time? I think that’s part and parcel of the leadership, to ask people outside the Met, 
including media and people who have long experience of the media, of how they view 
the Met so that you can reflect on it.” 

Despite this, Sir Paul suggested that he always took a cautious approach when meeting with 
Mr Wallis. He said:974

“Outwith  Mr  Wallis,  I  would  say  for  every  journalist  I’ve  ever  met,  they  would  be 
delighted if I was indiscreet. It was my job to ensure I wasn’t.”

5.82  During late 2009 and 2010 the MPS gifts and hospitality register and Sir Paul’s diary itemise 
a number of what are described as ‘private appointments’ with Mr Wallis,975 who by that 
stage had resigned from the NoTW.976 Sir Paul, for example, confirmed that he had attended 
a dinner with Mr Wallis and Mr Fedorcio in April 2010 at the Bbar restaurant; the dinner was 
marked as a private appointment and the diary records that no expenses were claimed. Sir 
Paul explained:977

“I would have either paid the whole or my share for a drink. I was always uncomfortable 
with the idea – not exclusively, but with the idea of billing the public purse for alcohol. 
So more often than not, I would pay if it wasn’t being a gift and hospitality.”

5.83  As to why this type of occasion was recorded at all given that there was no claim on the public 

purse, Sir Paul said:978

“… I think it’s better to be transparent and put as much in there as possible rather 
than leave things out. These matters were left to my private office and I think they 
did their level best to manage an extraordinary busy diary that changed on a daily 
basis, to try and record things so that it would not look like I was behaving in any way 
improper.” 

5.84  There is a discrepancy in the recollections of Sir Paul and Mr Wallis in respect of the level and 
nature of their contact. Mr Wallis suggested his relationship with Sir Paul essentially followed

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG“the same blueprint as my relationship with Sir John Stevens”.979 This included his providing 
Sir Paul with advice relating to his “campaign” to become Commissioner; he said that:980 

“… if we were together and the subject came up, I would tell him my view … If it came 
up, he asked my opinion, and I have opinions, so I wouldn’t have been hesitant about 
sharing them.” 

Mr  Wallis  said  that  he  met  Sir  Paul  approximately  six  times  a  year  while  he  was  the 
Commissioner, and that these occasions would be for dinner and also for the odd glass of 
wine. He also estimates that he spoke to Sir Paul over the telephone on average about once 
a month.981

5.85  Mr Wallis describes the basis of his contact with Sir Paul as being “the provision of informal PR 
advice, unpaid and often solicited by him.”982 Mr Wallis refuted any suggestions that he had 
exaggerated the level and nature of his contact with Sir Paul, saying, “I think what I’ve put in 
my statement was my memory of it. If his memory of it is different, then that’s unfortunate.”983 
For his part, Sir Paul said of Mr Wallis:984

“I  think  over  the  months  he’s  become  an  acquaintance.  His  company  would  have 
been enjoyable, like other people, but to say I was a friend, I think that would be 
taking it too far …”

As to the level of his contact with Mr Wallis, Sir Paul said:985

“… I met Mr Wallis, I think, on the records … once in 2008, three times in 2009 and 
twice in 2010, according to the records.” 

5.86  Sir Paul was absent from work through injury and illness between mid-December 2010 and 
early April 2011.986 Operation Weeting had commenced during his period of absence987 and 
Sir Paul described his general stance towards NI on his return:988 

“… I wouldn’t have refused to engage with anybody from News International, but I do 
think that once – Weeting was mounted. I was briefed on it briefly when I returned 
and realised that this was of a different order than we’d, for whatever reason, realised 
before. I’d have been much more circumspect in meeting with News International, 
yes.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG5.87  Specifically in respect of Mr Wallis, Sir Paul acknowledged that following his return to work 

in April 2011 he:989

 “… wouldn’t have wanted to do anything to compromise Weeting by a significant 
change  in  behaviour  that  allowed  somebody  who  may  be  become  a  suspect  to 
suddenly see that and start making preparations, but I think it is fair to say that I 
think it would have been rather clumsy to meet with Mr Wallis after his name entered 
into my consciousness around these matters. I think that would have been a little 
clumsy, so I would have tried to avoid that.” 

Champneys

5.88 

In the event, this incident is entirely irrelevant to the Inquiry but given the allegations which 
swirled around Sir Paul at the time when this Inquiry was set up, it is necessary to address the 
issue. Additionally, it forms the background to Sir Paul’s resignation as Commissioner of the 
MPS in July 2011. In short, Sir Paul underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from 
within his femur; this was followed by his accidental fracture of the same bone.990 In January 
2011, he accepted an offer to stay at Champneys that was made as an act of kindness by the 
owner, Steven Purdue, a business acquaintance and close friend of his daughter’s father-in-
law.991 

5.89  Sir Paul explained that although this was a private arrangement through a family friend, and 
Champneys Healthcare had no procurement history or activity with the MPS, he nevertheless 
instructed that it be entered into the Gifts and Hospitality Register.992 The entry, made on 4 
March 2011, was as follows:993 

“Provision of accommodation and food at Champneys Medical over five-week period 
in support of post-operative rehabilitation (provided by a friend through Sir Paul’s 
family and not in connection with the office of Commissioner).” 

The register, at Sir Paul’s insistence, also noted the person concerned, Stephen Purdue.994

5.90  Sir Paul described his rationale for accepting the offer to stay at Champneys, he said:995

“…  I  was  made  the  offer,  through  a  close  friend  of  my  daughter’s  father-in-law, 
somebody  I  knew,  to  assist.  He’d  heard  about  my  illness  and  he  wanted  to  assist. 
I  have  to  say  I  was  initially  reluctant  to  accept  it  because  I  think  one  is  generally 
reluctant very often to accept a very kind offer, but it’s also the case that I was advised 
medically that I wasn’t fit at that time to attend any other rehabilitative facility. I was 
still in a wheelchair and still on significant medication, and this possibly represented 
my best chance of getting back to work as early as possible. That’s the reason I did it 
… I felt under significant pressure to get back to work. I think in total I was off for the

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGbest part of four months. I felt under significant personal pressure to return to work 
as soon as possible, and my clear view was: if I didn’t get back within that time, then 
I wouldn’t go back at all, because I do not think you can leave an organisation like 
the Met, as good as your deputy is – and I think he did a fabulous job in my absence, 
but I do not think the leader of the Met can be absent for any longer than that and 
already there was reporting in the media about the absence of the Commissioner and 
the effect it was having on the Met. I felt I had to get back quickly. If I didn’t, I wasn’t 
going to get back at all and I desperately wanted to come back.”

5.91 

It  transpired  that  Champneys  had  in  the  past  engaged  Chamy Media,  the  public  relations 
firm that Mr Wallis had set up after he left the NoTW, in order to provide it with strategic 
communication advice and support it. Sir Paul explained that he had no knowledge of any 
connection between Mr Wallis and Champneys either before or during his stay, and he was 
not aware of anyone at the MPS who would have been aware of such a connection.996 Sir 
Paul stated that he first became aware of the link between Mr Wallis and Champneys on the 
morning of 16 July 2011, following a telephone call from a member of the DPA after there had 
been a media enquiry about it.997 

5.92  Despite his previous lack of knowledge of any connection between Mr Wallis and Champneys, 

Sir Paul explained why the disclosure of this information precipitated his resignation:998

“… I’ve always held a view – and the view was very much influenced by my experience 
as Deputy Commissioner – that if the story becomes about the leader as opposed 
to what we do, then that is a bad place to be. For whatever reason, that’s where I 
seemed to be …”

He added that:999 

“… I think in different circumstances, had I not had the health issue, without wishing 
to over play it, I might have come to a different conclusion, but it was clear to me that 
my reaction to the pressures was not in the same way I’d reacted to many pressures 
in the past and I didn’t think I had any alternative out of all sense of honour.” 

5.93  Sir Paul described the connection between Mr Wallis and Champneys as “damnably unlucky”1000 
and I fully agree with that assessment. Any suggestion that Sir Paul’s stay at Champneys was 
in some way influenced by its connection with Mr Wallis, or that this was a reward in kind 
from Mr Wallis for previous favours, is simply not borne out by any consideration of the facts. 
There is no evidence that Mr Wallis played any role in these events, and this would appear 
simply to be an unfortunate confluence of circumstances. The Home Secretary and the Mayor 
of London both expressed surprise and regret at the resignation; Sir Paul described how they 
expressed full support for him to stay in office.1001 For her part, the Home Secretary said:1002

“… I’d already had a conversation that weekend with Sir Paul when he’d spoken to me

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGabout the allegations that appeared in the newspaper about his stay at Champneys 
and  therefore  –  he’d  given  no  hint  in  that  conversation  at  a  possible  resignation, 
therefore when he rang me later that weekend to say that he had resigned, obviously 
that was a surprising turn of events. I feel that he led the Metropolitan Police well 
when  he  was  Commissioner,  and  I  think  …  the  organisation  at  the  end  of  it  was 
stronger  for  his  leadership  and  it  was  in  that  context  that  I  expressed  regret  that 
matters had come to this point.” 

5.94  Similarly, the Deputy Mayor for Policing, Kit Malthouse did not see any reason why Sir Paul 

had to resign and said:1003

“…  I  had  been  reassured  by  him  and  Mr  Godwin  that  the  coincidence  of  the 
Champneys hospitality and the involvement of Mr Wallis in the PR of that particular 
establishment was unfortunate, but that the two together had created a perception 
which Sir Paul obviously didn’t feel he could live with. I personally felt that the good 
of the organisation and the good of the city, in terms of keeping it safe, outweighed 
that particular consideration.” 

5.95  This part of the story can be concluded with further words from Mr Malthouse who added:1004 

“… I don’t think I’m revealing too much confidence in that it became apparent to me 
that Sir Paul Stephenson was completely shocked when it was revealed that Wallis 
was involved in Champneys. It seemed to take him totally by surprise, and therefore 
the coincidence of those two, which ultimately created the public perception which 
Sir Paul didn’t feel he could continue with, seemed very unfortunate. Unfair.”

6.	 Calibrating	the	harm:	the	views	of	Commissioners

6.1 

6.2 

Lord Condon
In putting this part of the Inquiry into context, Lord Condon described the history of police 
malpractice as being cyclical in nature, with the cycle generally taking place over a twenty 
year  period  and  being  something  akin  to  “scandal,  inquiry,  remedial  action,  relaxation, 
complacency, scandal, inquiry.”1005 

Against this backdrop, Lord Condon gave his general views, based on the evidence provided 
to this part of the Inquiry, about the way in which the relationship between the police and the 
press had altered since his Commissionership:1006

“Based on what is in the public domain, primarily from what has happened in your 
Inquiry … I have been very disappointed and concerned by some of the issues that 
have  emerged,  and  …  had  I  still  been  involved  in  the  service,  I  would  have  been 
probably very angry.”

6.3 

In analysing the altering in the relationship between the press and the police, Lord Condon 
rightly  acknowledged  the  transformational  advances  in  personal  communications  and  the

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGability of the Police Service and the media to interact ethically and unethically since his time 
as Commissioner. However, he suggested that some things were enduring and transcended 
technology or ephemeral crises.1007 

6.4  When considering the extent to which the relationship was in need of recalibration, and the 
methods by which that might be achieved, Lord Condon cautioned against a massive box 
ticking or bureaucratic approach to any reform.1008 Lord Condon also suggested that the very 
public nature of this Inquiry had already generated “massive corrective action”1009 within the 
Police Service, and said:1010

“… it’s a question of what more needs to be done to be built on that, and so I think I 
would be confident that … the Police Service now already feels very different around 
these issues than it did in the recent, very recent past. I would think that behaviour 
is fundamentally different now than even the very recent past. And so … I would be 
worried about anything which suggested that any contact between police and the 
media was almost inherently wrong, that the media are given some sort of pariah 
status,  that  almost  by  being  in  the  same  room  as  them  is  somehow  bad,  and  a 
massive box-ticking, that every time a policeman was in the same room or within 50 
yards of a journalist, they should have to write up an entry … they would probably 
do it electronically now, but some sort of record. So I think there could be a massive 
bureaucratic overreaction which won’t actually help anyone but will be seen as some 
sort of generalised panacea to the challenge. I think it is about strong leadership, it is 
about clear guidance, and it’s about the culture of the organisation …”

6.5 

That  being  said,  Lord  Condon  recognised  the  danger  of  simply  accepting  that  the  mere 
existence of the Inquiry had in fact provided a solution to some of the very important issues 
raised by the evidence that has been heard. This is particularly true given his diagnosis of the 
Police Service’s historical cycle of malpractice, for he went on to conclude:1011

“… history tells us that unless your report [the final Inquiry report] has within it things 
which are not ephemeral but are enduring, that do demand checks, that do demand 
action, that do allow auditing and monitoring and checking of these relationships, 
then the default position is in 10, 15 years’ time to get to that complacency point on 
that cycle again … I think the challenge is to find that something which avoids the 
massive  bureaucracy,  which  will  be  superficial,  and  something  that  really  hits  the 
spot, that does encourage change that is lasting … there are issues around very strong 
national guidance around police behaviour in relation to the media, reinforcement of 
what is appropriate, condemnation of what is wrong, and so on.” 

6.6 

Lord Stevens
Although  recognising  the  difficulty  in  providing  an  accurate  commentary  on  the  current 
relationship between the MPS and the media given his retirement from the Police Service 
in 2005, Lord Stevens felt that the culture between the two had changed significantly and 
understandably  in  light  of  the  events  which  precipitated  this  Inquiry.  His  perception  was

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthat  the  Police  Service  as  a  whole  was  now  highly  sensitive.  He  felt  that  any  contact  or 
relationship with the press was likely to be adversely construed and lead to criticism although, 
parenthetically, he accepted that this was perhaps inevitable given that one of the allegations 
made against the police had been that there had previously been an overly close relationship 
with the media.1012 

6.7 

Lord Stevens considered this state of affairs to be extremely damaging for British policing 
given his view that it was absolutely essential to have transparency and openness. He said:1013

“What I’ve heard, people are absolutely terrified of picking up a phone or speaking to 
the press in any way, [shame sic] shape or form and I don’t think that’s healthy. The 
press have a job to do. They deliver, on occasions, some outstanding work, especially 
investigative journalism sometimes. There has to be a relationship between the police 
and the media for the right reasons.”

6.8 

Lord Stevens’ assertion that it is absolutely essential for there to be transparent and open 
relationship  between  the  police,  the  press  and  the  public  is  a  view  that  I  both  share  and 
endorse. Perhaps, however, he went one stage further by suggesting that there may be a 
causal  relationship  between  the  heightening  of  community  tensions  and  public  concern 
over the actions of the police exacerbated by a lack of community engagement through the 
media.1014 Lord Stevens told the Inquiry:1015

“… in my time as Commissioner, I had two high profile shootings, one down at Brixton 
and the other was, of course, Mr Stanley at Hackney. One, it’s very important to get 
down there as quickly as you can and sometimes take a fair bit of abuse, as I certainly 
did in Hackney when I went down there. But secondly, you have to get your message 
out through the media, which most people are looking at, especially in this day and 
age … in terms of Twitter and the rapidity of communication. If you do not deal with 
that very, very quickly indeed, in terms of saying why you have been involved in a 
shooting or why you’ve done the actions you’ve done, then the whole thing will just 
escalate in a way that leads to massive public disorder, and any kind of research and 
knowledge of what takes place in these issues, whether it be in America or other parts 
of the world, comes out with a specific lesson that the message must be out there as 
quickly as you can of why the police did what they did and the media have to be the 
major part of doing that.” 

6.9 

Lord  Stevens  concluded  his  evidence  by  summarising  the  current  position  in  light  of  the 
evidence heard by the Inquiry with an eye also on the future policing landscape. He said:1016

“… I’m sure everyone … believes in freedom of the press, but there needs to be some 
structure and some monitoring processes … Something has to come out in terms of 
the monitoring and some kind of reinforcement of how the police act, I think.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGLord Blair

6.10  Lord Blair’s general reaction to evidence provided to the Inquiry was similar to that of Lord 

Condon, for he said:1017

“If you’re referring to the level of contact with the media, then yes, I have concerns 
about that and I particularly have concerns, if it’s true, and I believe it is … that there 
were a large number of dinners and large amounts of alcohol, and that would worry 
me.” 

Lord Blair described the overarching nature of his concerns in these terms:1018

“… I think it’s twofold. One is the perception not only of the public but of the more 
junior  officers,  who  must  look  at  this  and  wonder  whether  this  is  a  proper  use  of 
public  time  and  public  money.  And  secondly,  the  very  perception  …  that  it  is  very 
difficult not to put these two situations together in terms of the failure to investigate 
[a reference to Operation Caryatid] and the levels of contact, and not see a reference 
between them …” 

6.11  As  for  a  solution  to  the  issues  raised  by  this  part  of  the  Inquiry,  Lord  Blair  questioned 
whether further specific guidance, other than a requirement for absolute transparency, was 
necessary.  He  argued  that  the  more  complicated  the  codes  of  conduct  or  practice  in  any 
organisation become, the more complex is the task of enforcing them. Lord Blair stressed 
that it was important that any regulation did not become too over-prescriptive and said that 
what mattered more was the establishment of proper boundaries and the inculcation of a 
culture  that  would  then  impose  an  expectation  that  officers  would  act  professionally  and 
responsibly. Moreover, he suggested that any set of regulations covering the media would 
rapidly be overtaken by the developments of social media and citizen journalism. Lord Blair 
therefore argued for a set of principles which would guide practice.1019

6.12  Lord Blair expanded on this point and told the Inquiry:1020

“… I am of the view that for too much of the police’s time over the years there has 
been an emphasis on disciplinary codes and regulations rather than on the values of 
the organisation. One of the things that I did when I became Commissioner was to 
ask 5,000 members of staff what kind of organisation they wanted to belong to and 
what should its values be, and that was what we used in terms of the training of our 
senior officers, the transformational values of an organisation, and I would want to 
emphasise that it’s this aspiration to professional propriety that seems to me to be so 
important, rather than a set of regulations about what you mustn’t do.”

6.13 

In making this point, Lord Blair acknowledged the extreme difficulty in achieving a cultural 
shift, particularly in an organisation as large as the Police Service, and agreed therefore that 
what may be required was a combination of that element with some clear ground rules which 
were not overly prescriptive and thereby, because of their complexity, unworkable.1021

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGSir Paul Stephenson

6.14  Sir Paul considered HMIC’s report ‘Without Fear or Favour – A review of police relationships’ 
to be a “sound piece of work” and he agreed with the conclusions contained within.1022 In 
moving forward, Sir Paul argued that the issue was one of “personal and organisational values, 
professionalism  and  integrity  accompanied  by  effective  communication  and  appropriate 
checks and balances for the creation and maintenance of confidence.”1023 This he suggested 
must come from within the Police Service and could not be imposed from outside.1024

Commissioner Hogan-Howe

6.15  Commissioner  Hogan-Howe  reinforced  Lord  Stevens’  view  that  the  future  relationship 
between  the  police  and  the  media  must  be  based  on  a  principle  of  openness.  This,  he 
suggested, would allow the public and their representatives to hold the police to account 
for their relationships with the media and would also serve to remove any suspicion about 
that relationship.1025 The Commissioner candidly admitted in his evidence to the Inquiry that 
concerns about the relationship between the MPS and the press generally were clearly an 
issue on his arrival into the role in September 2011.1026

6.16  The Commissioner confirmed that there was an organisational concern that the relationship 
between certain sections of the MPS and the media had become overly close, and that view 
corresponded with feedback the organisation was receiving both internally and externally. 
He said:1027

“That was the concern that seemed to be in the public mind. I think even within the 
Met there were concerns about that. I think people have acknowledged that over time 
– although, in my view, the policy I think Sir John, now Lord Stevens, had established 
during his time, I think, in spirit was the right spirit, that probably the practice of 
that strategy had led to … too close a relationship with the press, and that was the 
feedback I was getting both from within the organisation and from those who cared 
about it from the outside.” 

6.17  Given these facts, Commissioner Hogan-Howe acknowledged that there was a clear need 
to  review  the  existing  procedures  governing  the  relationship  between  the  MPS  and  the 
media.1028 He also put forward his belief that as an organisation, the MPS had already begun 
to reset that relationship in the recognition that in future it needed to be more open and 
transparent with the public.1029 

6.18 

In seeking to tackle these wider organisational issues, Commissioner Hogan-Howe accepted 
the broader point that the relationship of the police with the media was only one element 
of the problem and that, to truly bring about long lasting cultural change, the Police Service

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGgenerally must have a clear sense of what was right and what was wrong. He expanded on 
this point and said:1030

“I think Elizabeth Filkin says if we only concentrate on our relationship with the press, 
we will probably miss the point in terms of some of the issues we have to address. So 
I accept that broad point. This is a symptom of something that we have to address. 
I suppose we have many guides in coming to that integrity issue of … what standard 
do we apply. So we have the Nolan principles. We have the oath that we swear to 
uphold the palace impartially. And … ACPO has carried out various pieces of work 
about ethics. So therefore there is a body of knowledge which we can use as points 
for referral, but I don’t think they’re too unique. You can say that, but I’m not sure 
they’re unique to the police. I think there are other organisations which would observe 
similar principles of integrity and probity. So for me that’s important. Probably the 
second point for me is that – I know I’m going to refer a little to Merseyside, but I’ve 
only  been  back  in  the  Met  for  a  few  months,  so  my  most  profound  experience  of 
leading an organisation was in Merseyside, but within a year we’d come to our own 
judgment about what our values were and the only guide I gave was I didn’t want us 
to have more than four. You can have a long list which no one can remember or you 
can have some that can really guide people in the moral dilemmas that sometimes 
policing delivers. So we agreed four that the organisation consulted on and we came 
up with four that certainly I could stand by, and we’ll do something similar in the Met. 
I’m not sure it’s right always to impose values, but I think there are things that you, 
as an organisation, stand for …”

7.	 The	question	of	corruption	
7.1 

In setting the historical context to this issue, Lord Condon observed that:1031 

“History  suggests  that  corruption  in  the  MPS  is  cyclical.  Sir  Robert  Mark  as 
Commissioner confronted this issue and 20 years later I was confronted with a similar 
challenge.” 

Lord  Condon  went  on  to  explain  that  within  days  of  taking  office  he  was  made  aware  by 
his  senior  team  of  the  challenges  the  organisation  faced.  He  also  described  the  types  of 
corruption that were identified:1032

“… in any major big city police service in the world, whether it’s London or equivalent 
major cities anywhere in the world, there will always be a small number of police 
officers, sadly, who are drawn into corrupt criminal practice, and it can vary from 
relatively minor right the way up to the most serious criminal offences.”

7.2 

The corruption described by Lord Condon was motivated primarily by financial gain and was 
not, at this stage, linked to the media.1033 He explained that from taking office in 1993, it took 
him until 1997/98 successfully to lobby for changes to the police disciplinary regulations to 
make it easier to deal with corrupt officers:1034

933

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“… Part of my agreeing to become Commissioner was an acceptance that I wanted 
to  be  and  needed  to  be  a  reforming  Commissioner  around  a  number  of  issues. 
One of them was police discipline, which I felt at the time made it very difficult or 
unnecessarily and unwisely difficult to deal with bad officers … Via evidence to the 
Home Affairs Select Committee and lobbying politicians and the media generally … 
the police discipline regulations were eventually changed, for the better, I believe, in 
the public interest, and … it took until 1999, and then the amended police regulations 
made it easier to deal with bad officers.”

7.3 

Lord Condon also introduced a number of policies aimed at maintaining integrity within the 
MPS which culminated in the launch of an anti corruption strategy in December 1998. It was 
contained in Special Notice 36/1998, ‘Corruption and Dishonesty Prevention Strategy’.1035 In 
relation to the strategy, he said:1036

“… this was really the culmination of a number of years. 1997, 1998 were particularly 
busy  …  Early  in  1998,  I  remember,  with  warrants,  we  raided  the  homes  of  about 
30  serving  and  retired  police  officers  and  started  some  major  corruption  inquiries 
into criminal matters. And then I wanted, before the end of 1998, to draw together 
in  one  document  our  ongoing  determination  to  deal  with  malpractice,  however  it 
manifested itself, and so this document, clearly though not perfect, was an attempt to 
bring together and make it absolutely clear to people what the rules of engagement 
were.”

7.4 

An anti-corruption strategy was certainly not a new concept within the Police Service and 
other versions had existed prior to the implementation of this particular Special Notice.1037 As 
Lord Condon explained:1038

“…  All  police  forces  are  against  corruption,  aren’t  they?  They  wouldn’t  be  for  it. 
And so I’m not being trite, but there would have been rules in all police forces at all 
times which would embrace the criminal law for dealing with criminal behaviour by 
police officers. There would have been disciplinary measures. But this was bringing 
it together in a special order, reinforcing the importance of it, rebriefing every senior 
officer  in  the  service,  down  to  and  including  chief  superintendents,  with  briefings 
about what we were doing, how serious we were, and then briefings beyond that, 
so that everyone in the Met, by the end of 1998, would have been in no doubt, in no 
doubt, how serious we were about dealing with these issues.”

7.5 

The  strategy  identified  six  strands  –  Prevention  and  Detection;  Inclusion;  Focus  and 
Accountability; Supervision and Leadership; Security, Screening and Vetting; and Corruption 
and  Dishonesty  Proofing.  Each  strand  identified  a  number  of  delivery  objectives  with  the 
initial phase designed to last three years. The philosophy of the strategy was “that the MPS 
will continuously invest effort and resources into assuring the highest levels of integrity for 
all  time.”1039  Lord  Condon  confirmed  that  the  strategy  had  been  intended  to  last  beyond

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGhis  tenure  as  Commissioner.  His  successor  to  that  role,  Lord  Stevens,  had  been  Deputy 
Commissioner at the time that the policy was promulgated and was said by Lord Condon to 
have been “fully supportive of it and carried it forward.”1040 As to whether he believed it to 
have been a success, Lord Condon said:1041

“Yes, I believe it was. If it hadn’t been, I would have taken, with senior colleagues, 
remedial action. I honestly believed at the time that this was probably one of the 
most demanding and appropriate sets of policies for dealing with malpractice of any 
major city in the world, and in fact we were visited by police forces from around the 
world who sought to replicate parts of it.”

7.6 

Lord  Stevens  explained  that  having  been  appointed  Deputy  Commissioner  of  the  MPS  in 
1998, he had been given specific responsibility for the modernisation of the organisation and 
for overseeing the fight against corruption within the MPS.1042 On becoming Commissioner, 
Lord  Stevens recorded  that there were concerns  within  the organisation  about  bribery of 
personnel by the media and suggested that it had been a continual battle to fight this form 
of corruption.1043 He said:1044

“Corruption is always there in a Police Service the size of the Metropolitan Police, and 
every now and again I was hearing stories that people either within the service or 
who had retired from the service might well be paid for newspaper reports, or tipping 
people off as to where certain raids were taking place, and therefore a strong anti-
corruption strategy and squad was essential.” 

7.7 

Lord Stevens explained that the concerns were expressed at quite a high level of generality 
and did not relate to any specific sections of the media. Despite these ongoing concerns, 
Lord Stevens believed that the Corruption and Dishonesty Prevention Strategy implemented 
during Lord Condon’s period as Commissioner had achieved “a great deal”, and had brought 
about a change in culture “through making sure there was a process by which corruption could 
be reported and ensuring that any personnel involved were arrested and prosecuted.”1045 

7.8 

During the course of the Inquiry there were a small number of references to historic corruption 
within the Police Service. Sir Harold Evans, former editor of The Times, gave evidence that 
The Times had made a surreptitious recording of a transaction:1046

“… between a corrupt policeman and a crook, and that led to the complete reform of 
Scotland Yard, and then Sir Robert came in, Robert Mark came in, and Scotland Yard 
began rooting out really massive corruption …” 

7.9 

Perhaps of more relevance to the Inquiry was the evidence of Jeff Edwards, former chief crime 
correspondent of the Daily Mirror, who alleged that whilst working as a staff reporter for the 
NoTW (he worked for that newspaper between 1981 and 1985) he was in effect asked to use

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGthe newspaper’s funds to bribe police officers for information. He suggested that this had 
taken place in late 1983 or the beginning of 1984 and described the circumstances relating 
to the request: 1047

“… the world of working in a Sunday paper environment is quite different from that, I 
discovered, working for, say, a London evening paper, as I had been previously, and I 
found the adjustment quite difficult. And it became apparent, I suppose, that I wasn’t 
doing the job to the satisfaction of my then boss, my news editor, and he became 
quite animated about this issue and we had a discussion one day … it’s one of these 
things that you never forget, frankly, and he said to me, “Look, you have to up your 
game, you have to up your performance”, and I said, “Well, it’s really difficult. You 
know, I’m struggling to make the adjustment to this different world” and so forth, and 
he said to me, “Look, there’s money available; you should be out there spending it on 
your contacts” … I can’t remember exactly how the dialogue flowed now, but I said, 
“I’m sorry, but are you suggesting?” and he said, “Well, you know, you need to sort 
of put some inducements out there”, and I said, “Right, okay”, and I sort of recoiled 
from this, but he was my boss so I dealt with it in a measured way and I went away 
and  I  thought:  did  I  hear  this  correctly?  Anyway,  about  three  or  four  weeks  later, 
clearly my performance was still not satisfactory, and he took me to one side and 
he was quite cross me, I suppose it’s fair to say, and he said to me, “Look, have you 
taken up my suggestion? I don’t see anything here. You’re not invoicing me for money 
to be splashed about. You should be essentially bribing more police officers.” At the 
time, and I realised it was probably an unwise thing to do, but I said, “I don’t think 
I came into journalism to do that sort of thing, and also, isn’t there a contradiction 
here? Part of what we’re about is exposing wrongdoing in public life, and here you 
are suggesting …” you know, anyway clearly the debate was over at that point, and 
a couple of weeks later I was removed from the post and replaced. I wasn’t removed 
from the company, I was simply moved to work away from crime reporting. It was 
30 years ago, I can’t talk about how things proceeded after that, but I thought it was 
indicative of the culture in that particular organisation at the time.” 

7.10  This reported exchange would appear to suggest that the practice of providing inducements 
to police officers was relatively commonplace at that time, although Mr Edwards asserted that 
he did not observe any of his colleagues participate in such behaviour.1048 Given that nearly 
30 years have elapsed since this purported incident took place, I provide it as a historical 
illustration only. It is certainly not evidence of a culture that currently exists within the Police 
Service  or  the  media,  although  recent  events  (investigated  in  Operation  Elveden)  suggest 
that there remain legitimate concerns that payments by journalists to police officers have 
continued in some form.

7.11  Of a more contemporaneous nature was the evidence of Bob Quick. Mr Quick joined the 
MPS as a police officer in 1978 and served in a variety of roles during his career in the Police 
Service.1049 Of most relevance to this section of the Report was his time spent within  the 
MPS’ Anti-Corruption Command. In 1999, Mr Quick was appointed Detective Superintendent 
Operations at the newly formed Anti-Corruption Squad, and then in February 2000 he was 
appointed the Commander of CIB, which included the investigation arm of Anti-Corruption

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGCommand  and  Complaints  within  the  MPS.1050  The  new  Command  was  established  in 
response  to  significant  intelligence  indicating  serious  corruption  was  being  perpetrated 
by a minority of officers within the MPS.1051 Mr Quick explained that through a long term 
covert operation named ‘Operation Othona’, which ran between 1993 and 1998, a strategic 
picture of the corruption threat within the MPS was formed. One of the identified threats 
was the unauthorised disclosure of sensitive information by police officers to journalists for 
payment.1052

7.12  Of direct relevance to this threat was ‘Operation Nigeria’, a covert investigation conducted 
by Anti-Corruption Command during 1999, which infiltrated the office premises of a private 
detective  agency,  one  of  the  proprietors  of  which  was  a  former  police  officer.  Mr  Quick 
explained that during the course of Operation Nigeria, it became clear that, amongst other 
activities, the agency was acting as a ‘clearing house’ for stories for certain newspapers. He 
suggested that many of the stories were being leaked by police officers who were already 
suspected of corruption, or by unknown officers connected to officers suspected of corruption, 
who were found to have a relationship with Southern Investigations.1053 To the best of Mr 
Quick’s recollection, this involved newspapers from more than one group.1054 He said:1055

“During the operation it became clear that officers were being paid sums of between 
£500 and £2,000 for stories about celebrities, politicians, and the Royal Family, as 
well as police investigations.”

7.13  Mr Quick explained that as a result of the intelligence garnered from Operation Nigeria, in 
about 2000, he had written a short report highlighting the role of journalists in promoting 
corrupt relationships with, and making corrupt payments to, police officers for stories about 
famous people and high profile investigations in the MPS.1056 Given the passage of time the 
report is no longer available, however, Mr Quick described his purpose in writing it:1057

“… I and others in my command became concerned about these relationships between 
journalists  and  police  officers  who  were  suspected  of  corruption,  and  it  became 
apparent that some officers were being bribed to provide stories; some of the officers 
were  providing  them  directly  or  from  their  own  contacts  within  the  Metropolitan 
Police, and I formed the view that that was a threat to the organisation and compiled 
a short report, to my recollection, proposing that we might deal with that by way of 
an investigation that looked at the financial transactions.” 

7.14  Furthermore, Mr Quick said that he believed:1058 

“… that the journalists that were paying the bribes were not paying them from their 
own funds, and the intelligence and evidence revealed payments of between £500 
and  £2,000,  and  therefore  we  believed  that  they  were  claiming  that  money  back 
from their employers, and that one of two possibilities arose: that they were falsely 
claiming that money back by purporting it to be for a reason other than payments

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGto  police  officers,  or  indeed  the  newspapers  were  in  some  way  complicit  in  those 
payments.” 

7.15  Mr Quick recalled that he submitted the report to Andy Hayman, who was at that time his 
direct report as the head of the MPS Professional Standards Department.1059 Mr Quick said 
that  Mr  Hayman  “had  reservations  based  on  potential  evidential  difficulties  pertaining  to 
privileged  material  (journalistic  material)”.1060  As  has  become  clear,  similar  concerns  were 
advanced in relation to Operation Caryatid and the application of PACE.1061 

7.16  Mr Quick was unable to say whether Mr Hayman referred this issue further up the command 

chain “although I was under the impression he had.”1062 He said:1063

“… it was an issue that he took time to think about, and I think the conversation went 
over a number of days, if not more than that, and I do recall a conversation with 
Commander  Hayman  about  the  evidential  challenges.  Did  we  have  a  perfect  case 
upon which to launch the investigation? Well, no, but we certainly had material that 
gave us a very strong suspicion that these journalists were making these payments, 
and therefore we debated the strength of the evidence and some of the complexities 
related  to  journalistic  privilege  or  journalistic  material.  I  was  of  the  view  that  the 
offences  we  were  looking  at  were  essentially  fraud  offences  and  that  it  wouldn’t 
necessarily offer any protection or be relevant, but in the end the discussion resulted 
in the decision that at that moment in time it was too risky to launch an investigation 
at that time.”

7.17  Mr Quick made clear that he felt that Mr Hayman was entirely sincere in his reservations at 

the time but he did not necessarily agree with his conclusions:1064 

“I don’t think we agreed. I proposed it firmly in the belief that there was a line of inquiry 
into what appeared to be a significant threat to the integrity of the organisation. I 
accept there were many practicalities and risks with taking that action, and I do feel 
that Commander Hayman prosecuted his arguments with all sincerity.” 

Beyond  what  he  had  learnt  through  Operation  Nigeria,  Mr  Quick  said  that  by  the  end  of 
2000 it was his belief that there was a common understanding within the MPS of the threat 
that  tabloid  journalists  posed  to  the  integrity  of  police  officers.  He  said  that  there  was  a 
“considerable ground to believe” that journalists from tabloid newspapers were:1065

“… corrupters, driven by intense competitive pressures to use unethical and unlawful 
means to secure stories that included corrupting police officers through payments.” 

7.18  Mr Quick went on to say: 1066

“… I think to the best of my recollection the Metropolitan Police had accumulated a

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGhuge volume of intelligence relating to the integrity of the organisation from a wide 
range of sources. We’d had the Operation Othona running for five years, and as time 
passed, a picture began to emerge of a serious threat … involving ex-officers who 
had left the service, possibly having been prosecuted or left after a discipline case, 
and journalists, so the officers that had moved into the private investigation arena, 
and there was an example here with [this private detective agency], but there were 
others, and journalists, and the trading of stories. And that picture slowly emerged in 
the late 1990s and early part of the last decade.” 

7.19  The behaviour referred to was frank corruption, that is to say a belief was formed that money 
was  changing  hands  for  stories.  It  would  appear  that  this  threat  has  not  dissipated  over 
time. From a perception standpoint (albeit again with the benefit of hindsight), it is perhaps 
concerning that this historical understanding of the threat posed by the nexus between serving 
or former police officers and journalists, and the methods by which certain journalists were 
obtaining stories was not heeded, particularly in the context of Operation Caryatid and the 
police’s understanding of the scale of the problem during the course of that investigation.1067 

7.20  Moving matters forward, the extensive scrutiny of how the police handled the phone hacking 
affair understandably led to concerns about police integrity and corruption more generally. As 
I have already covered in various sections of the Report, a series of reports were commissioned 
in parallel to this Inquiry: one from Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary on police 
integrity;  one  from  Elizabeth  Filkin  on  the  relationship  between  the  MPS  and  the  media; 
and the IPCC were asked by the Home Secretary to report on its experience of investigating 
complaints of police corruption.

7.21  Her  Majesty’s  Inspector  of  Constabulary,  Roger  Baker,  informed  the  Inquiry  that  HMIC, 

through its review, did not find:1068 

“…  evidence  to  support  any  contention  of  endemic  corruption  in  Police  Service 
relationships, either in relation to the media or more generally, with the majority of 
police officers and staff striving to act with integrity.” 

However, HMIC concluded that many forces were insufficiently risk aware. He identified as 
specific weaknesses the “absence of clear boundaries” regarding outside relationships and 
the  “lack  of  consistent  standards,  policies  and  procedures”  across  forces.1069  In  so  doing, 
Mr Baker noted the importance of public perception as well as the reality, and called for a 
“nationally agreed” approach to proactive governance and oversight of this issue.1070 

7.22  The ACPO lead on Professional Standards, Chief Constable Mike Cunningham, said that he 
believed that the “out and out bribery” of police personnel by the media was confined to 
“rare and isolated” occasions.1071 His basis for this assertion was the “evidenced ability and 
willingness of the service” to identify the potential for corruption.1072 He also cited the advent

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGof the Bribery Act 2010 as reinforcing HMIC’s findings that there was no evidence of endemic 
corruption in police relationship with the media.1073

7.23  Similarly,  the  overriding  message  that  can  be  drawn  from  the  second  report  of  the  IPCC 
(Corruption in the police service in England and Wales which is based on the IPCC’s experience 
from  2008  to  2011)  is  that  corruption  within  the  Police  Service  is  not  widespread,  nor  is 
it considered to be so. Quite rightly, however, the report points out that where corruption 
exists, it is corrosive of the public trust that is at the heart of policing by consent.1074 Largely 
as a result of the findings contained within the aforementioned reports, the Home Secretary 
concluded that:1075

“… looking at these issues, the vast majority of police officers and staff are striving 
to act with integrity, and instances where there are questions to be raised are very 
limited.”

7.24  Mrs Filkin in her report stated that:1076

“Most  inside  the  MPS  think  that  payment  for  information  is  received  by  few.  This 
conflicts with what some journalists have told me and with what some have now said 
to the Leveson Inquiry. The facts may be clearer when the current MPS enquiries are 
completed.” 

Mrs Filkin recorded suggestions of frank corruption, that is to say police officers receiving 
payment for information; she accepted, however, that she could not confirm whether or not 
the allegations were true given that they were made in very general terms.1077 

7.25 

It is in this context that it is necessary to consider Operation Elveden,1078 which is an investigation 
commenced by the MPS on 20 June 2011 when News International disclosed material that 
indicated that police officers had allegedly been receiving payments from journalists from the 
News of the World for the provision of confidential information.1079 In attempting to quantify 
the breadth of the problem, Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick observed that she did not 
think that corruption was “widespread or endemic”,1080 and described how she had come to 
form that view:1081

“I suppose it’s based on … a quite considerable length of service now, and a fairly 
considerable interest in these issues. So I have, you know, over the years, read quite 
a lot of research on the subject. I have spoken to colleagues in our police forces, I’ve 
worked with and in professional standards, and I know, from colleagues and surveys,

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGhow absolutely appalling the vast majority of officers and staff regard such behaviour, 
but I do acknowledge that there has been and no doubt is some of this going on. I 
don’t think we’ll be unique in that. We have to try to reduce it to a minimum and 
I  think  hopefully  get  rid  of  it,  but  as  Lord  Condon  said,  we  have  to  then  keep  the 
pressure  on  …  I  genuinely  believe  that  the  Police  Service  that  I  am  now  in  is  less 
corrupt than it has ever been, and I hope that continues. This is an element which is 
causing concern within the service and to the public, and we need to really … assess 
the full extent and then deal with it.”

7.26 

In a similar vein, Peter Clarke, formerly an Assistant Commissioner in the MPS, suggested that 
in his 30 years of service he could not recall “ever being involved in a case or incident where 
bribery of a police officer by the media was suspected.”1082 Lord Blair said that he was sure 
that bribery by the media of police officers “has happened and does happen.”1083 However, he 
believed that the number of officers taking money would be “relatively small and they will be 
of relatively low rank.”1084 On this later point, he explained:1085

“… we did an analysis some years ago of what the corruption problem being faced 
by the Met was, it was reasonably clear that we had broken network corruption of 
networks of officers, but the individuals were still out there and one of the trades was 
information … sitting in front of computers and so on is more likely to be somebody 
of a lower rank and quite often not a police officer, but a police employee. But I think 
also, most importantly of all is that senior officers have been through a long process 
of training and of inculcation of organisational values and I would be very concerned 
if I was seeing that senior officers were amenable to corruption in the same way as 
somebody else, somebody more junior. We would have failed.”

7.27  He therefore found it “inconceivable that senior colleagues would be taking money directly 
in this day and age. I just don’t think that is possible.”1086 Even in respect of the most junior 
officers and staff, Lord Blair was confident in his belief that they would have “understood 
the stance of the organisation against bribery and other forms of corruption, the lengths to 
which the organisation would go to uncover it and the penalties for being caught in corrupt 
activities.”1087 Lord Blair concluded by observing:1088

“I accept Lord Condon’s remark that the MPS is the ‘cleanest big-city police force in 
the world’, although I also accept that corruption is not cyclical but a permanent and 
evolving threat. I believe that, in the countering of that threat, the MPS is amongst 
the finest forces in the World.” 

7.28  Specifically in relation to police staff. Dick Fedorcio, former Director of Public Affairs for the 
MPS, suggested that he had no “specific evidence or experience of bribery of DPA personnel.”1089 
Moreover, he said that because he had been closer to DPA personnel and their activities than 
police officers he had been in a better position “to spot suspicious activity” and therefore he

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGdid not believe that “any personnel with the DPA have received bribes from the media.”1090 
That being said, Mr Fedorcio suggested that whilst he had no specific evidence or experience 
of bribery of police officers or staff by the media it would be “naïve to assume it has not taken 
place at some time.”1091

7.29  Sir Paul Stephenson said that he had “no doubt that incidents of bribery do occur.”1092 He 
also agreed with the IPCC’s analysis that where incidents of corruption do take place “they 
undermine the integrity of the force and damage the reputation of the service significantly.”1093 
However, like others, he was confident that corruption involved “only a tiny fraction” of MPS 
staff.1094 As to this, he said:1095

“I think there is very little one can do in terms of normal rules and governance to stop 
people behaving badly or corruptly. To deal with that, I think you have to do many 
other things, including right lines and various ways of investigating and looking in 
intelligence. So I don’t think there’s a great deal you can do if people are determined 
to behave unprofessionally. What you can do is put in place a sensible system and 
approach that reminds people that they should be behaving professionally. And the 
vast majority did. It was just a small minority, in my view.”

7.30  The current Commissioner of the MPS, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said that the MPS “works very 

hard to drive out corruption.”1096 He recognised, however, that:1097 

“…  there  will  be  a  very  small  minority  of  staff  who  act  corruptly.  We  do  not 
underestimate the damage this does to policing. It undermines the good work of the 
vast majority of honest and hard working MPS employees.” 

He also explained that any member of MPS personnel found to have accepted bribes:1098

“will,  where  the  evidence  allows,  be  subject  to  criminal  charges  or  disciplinary 
procedures depending on the legal advice at the time.” 

7.31  Training and guidance are obviously important preventive tools in seeking to address this issue. 
The relevant overarching guidance in this area is provided, first, through the ACPO Counter 
Corruption Advisory Group (ACCAG), whose ‘Guidance for the Investigation of Corruption’ 
was first published in 2003 and last formally revised in 2006 – this guidance has been adopted 
by all chief officers;1099 secondly, the recognised ‘Standards of Professional Behaviour’ are set 
out in the Schedule to the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008 and the related Home Office 
guidance (026/2008) on police unsatisfactory performance and misconduct procedures, and 
Standards of Professional Behaviour for Police staff, as agreed by the Police Staff Council –

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGagain, this guidance has been adopted by all police forces, including the MPS.1100 Both sets of 
guidance are currently under review and are dealt with in more detail below.

7.32  Commissioner Hogan-Howe explained that training is provided to MPS staff via its Professional 
Standards Support Programme (PSSP) which was established in 2009-2010. This saw training 
delivered to a proportion of the operational front line staff “as to how to deal with a corrupt 
approach, using case studies, as well as debt awareness training.”1101 The training was not 
mandatory,  but  Mr  Hogan-Howe  estimated  that  it  was  delivered  to  “12,500  members  of 
operational staff and various other business groups, including the Information and Resources 
Directorate.”1102 Similar evidence was provided by other forces. Simon Ash, Chief Constable of 
Suffolk Constabulary, for example, said that its Professional Standards Department delivered 
training regarding “the expected standards of professional behaviour.”1103 Chris Sims, Chief 
Constable of West Midlands Police, said that all of his officers had “received significant training 
around culture and values and all supervisors receive technical training on anti-corruption 
measures.”1104

7.33 

In  summary,  the  best  present  analysis  would  suggest  that  although  corruption  is  not 
widespread  in  the  Police  Service,  where  it  does  exist  it  has  a  corrosive  effect  on  public 
confidence in the service as a whole. Until the outcome of the investigations contained within 
Operation Elveden, however, it is not possible to go further. 

7.34  Evidenced by the guidance and training currently in place, and the vigour with which individual 
police officers and police staff are pursued where criminality is identified, it is clear that the 
Police  Service  takes  this  issue  seriously.  There  are,  however,  gaps  and  weaknesses  in  the 
collective approach to the issue a number of which have been identified by HMIC. Having said 
that, I am in no doubt that the Police Service is genuine in its desire to tackle corruption head 
on, with the ACPO led response to the HMIC report being particularly important in this regard. 
For my part, I would whole heartedly adopt the HMIC recommendations relating to the need 
for consistent national standards and guidance, enhanced training and awareness, and more 
robust corporate governance arrangements. From the stand-point of sanctions, corruption is 
a criminal offence with serious penalties, I do not feel it necessary therefore, to recommend 
any additional statutory or regulatory tools to assist in dealing with this important issue.

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGis to secure and maintain public confidence in the police complaints system in England and 
Wales. In addition to this statutory responsibility, part of its guardianship role involves an 
obligation to measure, monitor and where necessary, seek to improve the current system. Ms 
Furniss makes clear that the IPCC is independent by law, and that its Commissioners cannot 
have worked for the Police Service in any capacity. The IPCC makes its decisions independently 
of  the  police,  Government,  complainants  and  interest  groups.1105  Ms  Furniss  described  its 
broad remit in these terms:1106

“It is the body that provides oversight of the complaints system for the police. There 
are other organisations we also have responsibility for [Since 2004 the IPCC’s remit 
has been extended to include serious complaints and conduct matters relating to staff 
at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs 
(HMRC) and the UK Border Agency (UKBA)],1107 but … I’ll focus on the police. It’s a slight 
misnomer, a name that Parliament gave us, which gives the impression, of course, 
that we deal with complaints against the police. In fact, we don’t, largely. Matters 
come to us in three different ways. The public can seek our advice and assistance in 
making a complaint against the police, but those complaints are the responsibility of 
the Police Service to deal with. The public can then make – they have a right of appeal 
to us if they’re dissatisfied with how the police dealt with their complaint, and we get 
about 7,000 of those each year. Perhaps most importantly, the police are required 
under law to refer matters to the IPCC, so certain categories of misconduct by the 
police or incidents that have caused concern are required by statute to be referred 
to us. To illustrate the point, when someone dies as a result of police action or as a 
result of police inaction or allegedly so, they’re required to refer it to us. Other serious 
misconduct. The police can also choose to refer matters to us if they believe it would 
be in the public interest to do so …” 

8.2 

Furthermore, Ms Furniss explained that although the IPCC had responsibility for the police 
complaints  system  overall,  the  Commission  investigated  only  a  very  small  proportion  of 
cases themselves, usually only the most serious complaints and allegations of misconduct 
against the police in England and Wales. Each Police Force had its own Professional Standards 
Department  (PSD)  which  dealt  with  the  vast  majority  of  complaints  and  conduct  matters 
against police officers and police staff.1108 Ms Furniss told the Inquiry how the IPCC fulfilled 
its remit:1109

“In relation to complaints and appeals, our process is that a member of staff, suitably 
trained, will assess the matter that comes to our attention. In an appeal, they have 
the responsibility to determine – there are different kinds of appeals, which makes it 
even more complicated to explain, but different kinds of appeals against, for example, 
the Police Service’s decision not to record a complaint against how they’ve handled 
it and against the findings or outcome of how they’ve handled it, and what my staff 
do is review the evidence – it’s a paper exercise, the appeal. They would review how 
the matter had been dealt with and determine whether the police had actually come 
to the right decision based on the evidence, and as a result of that, we can require 
the police to take further action. We can uphold the appeal and require the service to

8.3 

As well as the appeals and complaints element of the IPCC, there is also an investigative arm. 
The IPCC has its own team of investigators, about 150 staff, who support the investigative 
work, none of whom are currently serving police officers, although a proportion have worked 
as police officers or police staff prior to joining the IPCC.1110 Most, however, are individuals 
that the IPCC has recruited from outside of the policing world, including some lawyers, and 
a training programme is in place for those investigators. Ms Furniss told the Inquiry that the 
IPCC’s investigators had similar powers to that of a constable, and could arrest and interview 
suspects under caution: these powers are used on a regular basis.1111 Ms Furniss described 
the use of this investigative element:1112

“… one of the most important decisions that the Commission makes is the mode of 
investigation for a matter that’s been referred to us. So a decision needs to be made 
as to how this matter should be investigated, and we have three options ourselves, 
and a fourth one that the IPCC can decide that the matter should be independently 
investigated  by  our  own  staff,  fully  by  our  own  staff.  [Secondly  i]t  can  decide  to 
manage  the  investigation  under  our  direction  and  control  but  where  most  of  the 
work will be done by local police staff and usually Professional Standards Department 
police officers. Thirdly, we can supervise it, where the direction and control is with the 
force, but the IPCC receives the report at the end of it. Fourthly, we can decide that 
it’s perfectly capable of being investigated by the police without our intervention …”

Corruption in the Police Service in England and Wales

8.4 

8.5 

It was within this context, and following the concerns about the propriety of relationships 
between  some  police  officers  and  the  media,  including  allegations  of  illegal  payments  by 
journalists in exchange for confidential information, that the terms of reference for this part 
of the Inquiry were formulated. In addition, using her statutory powers under Section 11 (2) 
of the Police Reform Act 2002, the Home Secretary asked the IPCC to prepare a report on 
their experience of investigating corruption in the Police Service.1113 

The first part of this two stage report, ‘Corruption in the Police Service in England and Wales’ 
was published by the IPCC in August 2011.1114 It described the role of the IPCC, the definitions 
of corruption and the issues arising from it. Based on its experience, the IPCC concluded that 
it seemed likely that corruption amongst police officers was relatively rare by comparison 
with some other jurisdictions. However, the report rightly recognised that any allegation or 
finding of corruption impacted on the standing of all forces. Furthermore, it suggested that 
the damage that could be done to all of the professional, hard-working and dedicated police 
officers and staff by the corrupted few should not be underestimated.1115 The IPCC’s second 
and final report, ‘Corruption in the Police Service in England and Wales: Second report – a 
report based on the IPCC’s experience from 2008 to 2011’,1116 was published on 24 May 2012. 
Part two of the report sought to set the current concerns in the context of police corruption

more broadly. It examined the public view of the nature, extent and effect of corruption in 
the police, and analysed corruption-related complaints recorded by police forces in England 
and Wales and those cases that are referred to them by the IPCC. The report also provided 
case studies of the serious corruption investigations carried out by the IPCC.1117 

Given  the  broader  concerns  about  police  integrity  and  corruption,  the  report  was 
commissioned alongside that of the HMIC report, ‘Without Fear or Favour’, and Elizabeth 
Filkin’s report on the relationship between the MPS and the media, all of which have run 
parallel to this Inquiry. Along with the other reports, those presented by the IPCC provided 
a very useful window on this general topic. At the same time, the IPCC had been carrying 
out or supervising investigations into allegedly corrupt relationships between police officers, 
mainly in the MPS, and the media. To such extent as is possible without prejudicing ongoing 
investigations, I deal with the product of those investigations elsewhere.

In summarising the view of the IPCC, Dame Anne Owers, its Chair, concluded that although 
the overriding message was that corruption within the Police Service was not widespread, 
nor  considered  to  be  widespread,  where  it  did  exist,  it  was  corrosive  of  the  public  trust 
which was the central tenet of policing by consent. She asserted, and I entirely agree, that 
public confidence in and acceptance of the police exercising their considerable powers over 
the population was heavily dependent on a belief in the integrity of individual officers.1118 
Having said that, Ms Owers reports that some of the investigations undertaken by the IPCC 
had revealed serious corruption within the Police Service, sometimes at a senior level and 
sometimes  preying  upon  precisely  those  vulnerable  individuals  whom  the  police  were 
required to protect. On the other hand, providing a measure of reassurance, she pointed out 
that many of these cases had come to light as a direct result of the action taken by local forces 
and police authorities.1119

8.8 

The report provides a summary of the outcome of all police corruption cases investigated by 
the IPCC between the period 2008/9 and 2010/11:1120

•  Of the 104 independent and managed investigations considered during this period, the 
IPCC referred 47 (45%) cases to the CPS. In the 42 of those cases completed [at the time of 
the report’s publication], involving 51 officers, 18 officers were charged and prosecuted, 
13 were found guilty and 10 were imprisoned. In terms of rank, most of the officers were 
constables, with one being a sergeant and one being of ACPO rank.

•  Of the 113 officers subject to completed IPCC investigations, 87 (77%) were the subject of 
misconduct proceedings. These resulted in a finding of gross misconduct or misconduct 
for 76 (87%) of officers. In 18% of cases, officers were dismissed or required to resign, 34% 
of officers were given a written warning and 29% were subject to management action.

8.9 

Although concluding that there was nothing to suggest that police corruption was endemic, 
or that police forces and authorities were not making serious efforts to identify and deal with 
it when it did occur, the report did however identify a number of suggested areas for change. 
These included:1121
•  It was suggested that there was a need for clearer information for the public on what

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGconstituted police corruption. To this end the IPCC would produce a regular analysis of the 
corruption cases that it had dealt with, identifying any emerging themes.

•  The report concluded that there should be a requirement for Chief Constables to ensure 
greater  consistency  in  the  recording  and  referral  of  corruption  cases  to  the  IPCC.  The 
Commission had written to Chief Constables making clear its expectations; this would be 
reinforced in the Statutory Guidance it intended to issue later in 2012.

•  The  report  suggested  that  there  was  a  need  for  a  more  effective  national  system  for 
handling allegations against very senior officers i.e. those of ACPO rank. The IPCC reported 
that  it  would  work  with  HMIC,  the  new  National  Crime  Agency  (NCA)  and  the  CPS  to 
establish a more formalised and robust system for escalating such complaints.

•  Given that most corruption allegations would continue to be dealt with by the individual 
forces concerned, including by their own standards and anti-corruption units, the IPCC 
would consider whether its oversight of these processes needed to be strengthened, and 
what resources would need to be available to do so.

•  The report understandably concluded that the public expected serious corruption to be 
investigated by an organisation independent of the police. The IPCC recorded that it stood 
ready to take on more corruption cases if additional resources could be made available. 
Moreover, the report made clear that within existing resources, the IPCC would continue 
to conduct a small, but increased, number of independent investigations into corruption 
cases, prioritising those involving senior officers, serious criminal allegations and gross 
abuse of police powers.

•  Finally, the IPCC suggested that additional powers were necessary to enable it to conduct 
the most effective corruption related investigations. They identify that this was particularly 
so in respect of contractors, access to third-party data and the power to require the police 
and other responsible bodies to respond formally to their recommendations. The IPCC 
recorded that discussions were under way with Home Office officials and Ministers to take 
this forward. 

8.10  The Home Secretary confirmed that last point and provided the Inquiry with her summary of 

the key findings. She said:1122

“I  think  the  key  findings  that  come  out  of  this  in  many  ways  chime  in  with  those 
previous work that’s been done, particularly by the HMIC, about the need for greater 
clarity both for the public in terms of what’s police corruption and therefore what 
is  appropriate  to  bring  to  the  IPCC,  but  also  greater  clarity  in  terms  of  –  perhaps 
greater consistency in recording incidents that have taken place from force to force. 
They identify that different forces appear to have … different levels of reporting of 
complaints about corruption and the question is raised as to whether that’s because 
of a different definition being used rather than the behaviour in relation to the forces. 
Crucially, it refers again to the issue of additional powers and also about resources, 
and these are issues that we intend, when legislative time allows, to be able to make 
changes to the powers to the IPCC and we are looking at the case that they’ve put 
forward in relation to additional resources.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG8.11 

I certainly support these proposed changes and share the IPCC’s view that in order for the 
system to work as it should, it is vital that all police forces are both alert to allegations of 
corruption  and  are  capable  of  dealing  with  them  effectively  and  appropriately.1123  I  also 
agree that this is an area in which independent oversight is essential, particularly from the 
standpoint of public perception, not least because the confidence of the public in the police is 
fundamental to its legitimacy and to the absolutely critical co operation and compliance that, 
as an organisation, it needs both to expect and also to achieve.

9.1 

9.2 

Functions, remit and powers
An  inspectorate  of  police  was  established  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  County  and 
Borough Police Act 1856, and the first Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMIs) were then appointed 
for the purpose of inspecting the efficiency and effectiveness of individual police forces. In 
1962, the Royal Commission on the Police formally acknowledged the contribution to policing 
made by Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) and established the Inspectorate as 
both a monitor of, and a catalyst for, policing change.1124 

Between 2004 and July 2012,1125 HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary was Sir Denis O’Connor 
who had himself served both as an Assistant Commissioner in the Metropolitan Police and 
then as Chief Constable of Surrey. He made the point that, over the last two decades, there 
has been a notable acceleration in the pace of police reform, which had served to broaden the 
scope of the Inspectorate to the role it performed today.1126 Currently, HMIC independently 
assesses police forces and policing activity ranging from neighbourhood teams, serious crime 
and  the  fight  against  terrorism.  Sir  Denis  told  the  Inquiry  that  in  preparing  their  reports, 
HMIC asked the questions which informed citizens would ask, and published the answers 
in  accessible  form,  using  their  expertise  to  interpret  the  evidence.  HMIC  also  provide 
authoritative  information  to  allow  the  public  to  compare  the  performance  of  their  force 
against others and their evidence is then used to drive improvements in the service provided 
to the public.1127 HM Inspector (HMI) Roger Baker, formerly Chief Constable of Essex, who 
now has responsibility for police forces in the Northern Region, described the functions of 
HMIC in his own terms:1128

“I think it’s a police watchdog, in that it assesses policing and police forces in the 
public interest. So that can range from looking at local efficiency and effectiveness 
of a police force to broader policing issues such as the riots of last summer … we ask 
questions that the public would want us to ask and we report it back to the public in 
hopefully straightforward terms.”

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG9.3 

HMIs are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary and report 
to HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, who is independent of both the Home Office and the 
Police Service.1129 There are currently four HMIs in addition to the Chief Inspector: only two 
of the five have a background in policing. Mr Baker described the make-up of the team at the 
time of the Inquiry:1130

“…  it’s  a  broad  church  …  There  should  be  four  inspectors  and  one  chief  inspector. 
Of  the  four,  two  of  us  are  ex-chief  constables.  One  is  now  the  Commissioner  of 
the  Metropolitan  Police.  Bernard  went  across.  He  was  an  inspector.  He’s  now  the 
Commissioner of the Metropolitan, and the other two inspectors currently don’t have 
a police background. One was a chief crown prosecutor in London and one worked for 
the Audit Commission. So there’s a mixed range of skills.” 

9.4 

9.5 

In addition to HMIs, the Inspectorate has a workforce of 150 staff, of which 44% are permanent, 
41% are seconded and 15% are casual, agency or contract staff. Sir Denis told the Inquiry that 
this enabled HMIC to bring a wide mix of skills and disciplines to the organisation in order 
for them to carry out work across a diverse range of subject areas and areas of expertise.1131

HMIC’s principal statutory duties are set out in the Police Act 1996 (as amended in 2002) 
and the Police and Justice Act 1996.1132 Within this statutory framework, Sir Denis described 
HMIC’s role as providing an incentive for police forces to improve effectiveness and value for 
money in a monopoly sector.1133 Unlike many regulators, HMIC does not have the power to 
impose standards or prices but instead seeks to secure improvement through the provision of 
an independent, professional assessment of police work.1134 Against this backdrop, Sir Denis 
described HMIC’s powers over individual police forces:1135

“HMIC has the power to inspect the efficiency and effectiveness of police forces and 
currently police authorities. That will change in November. It will be restricted to the 
police forces. Since January 2, I have sought and at my behest, we have had power 
to seize documents and to enter premises, in order to pursue our duties. Not, dare I 
say, that we have been challenged, but it is best to be prepared, not just legislate for 
good times.”

9.6 

Sir Denis told the Inquiry that in normal circumstances, police authorities and, in future, Police 
and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) would regulate the activities of police forces. However, in 
extreme circumstances of sustained failure, HMIC could provide advice to the Home Secretary 
who had powers to direct the authority (or the IPCC).1136 When an issue emerged as being of 
national importance or one which was clearly systemic in nature, the Home Secretary may 
ask HMIC to conduct a review or, with a degree of independence, HMIC may initiate one

emerged, HMIC could tackle that issue whether or not required to do so by the Home Office 
or identified within the business plan.1138 By way of example, he referred to the G20 summit 
and Anti-Social Behaviour. 

9.7 

Sir Denis told the Inquiry that HMIC did not have any formal coercive legal powers in relation 
to any recommendations they might make, but, as an organisation, had considerable influence 
over police forces and currently police authorities. He said:1139

“… depending on the nature of the recommendations, the seriousness of the issue, 
we  will  pursue  it,  but  what  we  try  to  do  is  seek  agreement  from  the  chief  officer 
and the chair of the authority, depending on what the recommendations are … We 
have some influence, and we try to know our place as well. The only other thing I 
would  say  is  it  is  sometimes  mistaken  from  –  externally  that  the  publication  of  a 
view by an independent body like ourselves is a matter of some significance to chief 
constables and police authorities and there is … I suppose a degree of leverage that 
flows from the publication of what you’ve found and then any follow-up is still found 
to be wanting. It may sound rather like soft power. It is obviously less of an obvious 
sanction that [sic] some other regulators, but it has its place.”

9.9 

Immediately following her statement to the House of Commons on 18 July 2011 about the 
MPS and the associated matters of police integrity and public confidence,1140 and in addition 
to her request to the IPCC, the Home Secretary formally asked Sir Denis to carry out a review 
to consider instances of undue influence, inappropriate contractual arrangements and other 
abuses of power in police relationships with the media and other parties, with a view to HMIC 
making recommendations to her about what needed to be done.1141 

On 22 July 2011, the Home Secretary wrote to all Chief Constables to inform them that she 
had asked HMIC to conduct such a review, but also to make clear that this work, as well as that 
of the IPCC and Elizabeth Filkin, was not intended to pre-empt the outcome of this Inquiry. 
Rather  it  was  to  ensure  that  any  lessons  that  were  capable  of  being  applied  immediately 
could be identified sooner rather than later.1142 

9.10  Sir Denis asked Roger Baker to lead the review, which was conducted over a period of three 
months. A draft was provided to the Home Office in November 2011, and the final report was 
published in December 2011.1143 As well as gathering evidence from stakeholders within the 
Police Service and liaising with media experts, including the CRA, HMIC looked at the issue 
from the perspective of the public. Quantitative and qualitative research was conducted with

perception of what represented integrity (with corruption as the antithesis of integrity), how 
prevalent  the  public  thought  corruption  was  within  the  Police  Service,  and  whether  their 
attitudes had been affected by recent events.1144 Sir Denis provided the Inquiry with his views 
on the value of public opinion in this domain:1145

“… it’s another anchor point, I suppose, in police legitimacy  … With a measure of 
public sentiment, anything is possible. Without it, progress is very difficult. In relation 
to  this,  I  was  actively  interested  to  see,  frankly,  whether  what  had  occurred  last 
summer had made a real dent in the police reputation, in the public’s belief in them 
and the trust, and that’s why myself and Mr Baker undertook this work …”

9.11  The  internal  Police  Service  evidence  gathering  included  500  interviews  with  affected 
personnel, and approximately 100 focus group sessions were conducted within the forces and 
police authority’s that HMIC visited during the course of the review.1146 Mr Baker explained 
why this exercise was important and summarised the general views expressed during these 
evidence gathering sessions:1147

“… we wanted to get a view from the workforce on how they saw these issues, and I 
think it’s right to say here that their moral compass was very strong on these things. 
They were very clear that lots of these things, in their view, were not acceptable … 
The staff were clear in two parts … One, where there was clear leadership from the 
top, they understood what the rules were and were happy to go along with that. And 
secondly, where it was less clear and when they were talking about what gratuities 
and hospitalities it was right to receive, in my words their moral compass was very 
strong. There was a clarity of, you know, most things were not acceptable. Teas and 
coffees were; beyond that then the Police Service shouldn’t be engaging in it.” 

9.12  HMIC also undertook a number of benchmarking exercises across the public and private sector, 

both nationally and internationally.1148 Mr Baker provided a summary of the findings:1149

“…  we  contacted  not  only  police  forces,  nationally  and  internationally,  but  other 
organisations to take a view on all of the component parts of this report. So what 
were their relationships with the media and how did they manage it, some of which 
is cited in the report. So the New South Wales Police media policy, how New York 
Police Department dealt with integrity testing, because they have a 650-strong team 
on internal affairs that are separate from the police, if you like. I don’t necessarily 
advocate that model. But also other organisations such as banks, charity organisations 
–  so  third  sector  –  on  how  they  were  dealing  with  inappropriate  disclosures  of 
information and relationships. So not just about policing, but added the Police Service 
benchmark, and we didn’t find the cure for this in any other organisation. In fact, in 
many parts, the Police Service in England and Wales was a lot stronger than many

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG… organisations, nationally and internationally, that we spoke to. So if you took in 
appropriate  disclosure  of  information  recorded  by  the  Information  Commissioner, 
there  are  far  more  complaints  about  other  organisations  than  there  are  about 
policing, for example. So the police came out of that strongly. I know it’s easy to put 
them in the spotlight with this, but whilst they have a way to go, whilst you’d find on 
policies and procedures 70 or 80 per cent of forces would have some sort of policy, 
if  you  applied  that  to  most  of  the  sectors,  you  were  down  to  20  and  30  per  cent 
had got policies around it. In some cases, the Police Service were outshone by other 
organisations, but generally in just one component part of what we looked at.”

Summary of key findings

9.13  The report neatly set out the essence of the issue that it was seeking to evidence and address 

in these terms:1150

“The  aftermath  of  the  phone  hacking  affair  has  generated  a  number  of  enquiries 
into the relationships between the media, the police and others, and the conflict of 
interests that can arise from them. A conflict of interest arises where police officers 
or staff give (or appear to give) preferential treatment to one interest over others. At 
best, this behaviour may be regarded as inappropriate; at worst, as corrupt. Potential 
conflicts of interest include:
•   The access and influence accorded to individuals and organisations;
•   Inappropriate  disclosure  of  information  to  the  media  and  others,  whether  for 

financial gain or otherwise;

•   Excessive or inappropriate hospitality, especially when offered to senior officers 

and other decision makers;

•   Question marks over contractual arrangements and police-supplier relationships; 

and

•   Secondary business interests which may conflict or be perceived to conflict with the 
integrity of the police role (including employment taken by staff while serving with 
a force, and employment taken up immediately after leaving the Police Service).” 

9.14  The  report  found  that  whilst  corruption  was  not  endemic  in  the  Police  Service,  forces 
and  authorities  were  generally  unsighted  of  the  risks  and  vulnerabilities  associated  with 
relationships with others, including the media. The report noted that the absence of clear 
boundaries for police relationships with others was a cause for concern, as was the lack of 
consistent standards, policies and procedures across forces and authorities.1151 Of particular 
significance as far as I am concerned, the point is also made that from the perspective of the 
public, the Police Service needed not only to act fairly, but must also be seen to be acting 
fairly.1152 Mr Baker told the Inquiry that he placed perception at almost the same level of 
importance as reality, and said:1153

“… I think it was particularly important that – not only as a regulator but all of us, that

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGwe take the public’s view, particularly if you’re talking about the public interest, and 
that’s what, on this occasion, 3,500-plus members of the public who were surveyed 
said, “That’s what we think.”

9.15  HMIC found that the public associate integrity with being treated fairly by the police. Mr Baker 
pointed  out  that  the  public  association  of  integrity  with  fairness  suggested  that  they  saw 
inappropriate relationships, and the conflicts of interest that might arise as a consequence, 
to be one, but not the only, dimension of police integrity. He suggested, entirely correctly in 
my view, that this had implications for the police if they were seeking to tackle corruption 
and inappropriate relationships from the perspective of the service user or the public more 
generally. This clearly included the relationship between the police and the media.1154 

9.16  The term “corruption” obviously covers a broad spectrum of behaviour and the report makes 
it clear that frank corruption, that is to say, money passing hands and clearly at one end of 
the spectrum, is thankfully relatively rare. At the other end of the spectrum, however, is what 
Sir  Denis  described  as  ‘soft  corruption’.  He  explained  the  type  of  behaviour  which  would 
encapsulate this concept and the importance that the public places on it in these terms:1155

“… it’s doing favours, treating something much more favourably, one institution than 
another, you know, a place where hot dogs or something are served, one particular 
franchise much more favourably than another. That would raise a question in their 
mind because they’re obviously seeing things on the street every day, and it kind of 
anchors us a little bit that even at the lower end, as some people would see it, of what 
happens, there is an expectation of the police, thankfully, which is hugely inspiring. 89 
per cent of the public think that they should be better than others in regard to their 
mission and what they do and be very even-handed about it …”

9.17  Given the importance of perceptions, the report suggested that the over-arching principle of 
police relationships with the media was that the Police Service should not seek to constrain 
the media but rather allow them to accurately report news so that the principal beneficiary 
was the public. However, the report makes equally clear that forces should take account of 
the level and intensity of these relationships and not least how they would be perceived by 
the public.1156 Sir Denis elaborated on this point:1157

“… if the relationships become, as it were, visible and particularly focused on one 
or two individuals or one particular news organisation – this really is in more of a 
national  level  than  a  local  level,  where  very  often,  frankly,  there  is  only  one  local 
newspaper – then the point is that people may have the wrong perceptions of it, or 
maybe the right perception, but … it may cause them to become concerned.”

9.18  There has been much debate during the course of this Inquiry as to the differences between 
the position of the MPS compared with that of regional police forces. HMIC suggested that 
this  debate  missed  the  point.  The  report  argued  that  we  were  living  in  a  world  of  virtual

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGcommunications, with issues being followed in real-time through a range of new technology 
and social media.1158 Sir Denis said:1159

“I think intense inquiries which will generate competition for information can happen 
anywhere in this country. That’s a fact. If you look at Cumbria – you know, think of 
the  last  couple  of  years.  Cumbria,  Northumbria,  Bristol.  So  those  kind  of  inquiries 
which draw the most intense scrutiny can happen anywhere and with that potential 
conflicts  of  interest  and  issues,  but  running  alongside  that  is  a  whole  new  world 
which is unwrapping around us, as people twitter this Inquiry and as people engage 
in  a  huge  range  of  social  media,  and  that  includes  people  who  are  serving  police 
officers and members of staff who may or may not be aware of just how much of 
themselves they are revealing, and we did not find that that issue was restricted to 
the Metropolitan Police.”

9.19  The  report  described  as  the  key  contributor  to  promoting  integrity  “visible  consistent 
leadership”. Mr Baker said that the evidence to support that conclusion lay in the Inspectorate’s 
visits to forces where they found:1160 

“… the chief officer and the chief officer team were very clear on what was right and 
what was wrong and that was being articulated in not only bits of paper but the way 
they behaved, you would get that feedback from the staff, but you’d also see it when 
you tested some of those areas of business. Where they would bring in that clarity to 
it, we found a difference.” 

9.20  The report also made clear that visible and consistent leadership was a key factor in ensuring 
good force corporate governance and oversight. HMIC argued that this was more than just 
systems  and  processes,  but  also  required  those  in  charge  of  the  organisation  and  those 
who represented it to be consistent in demonstrating appropriate behaviour: they should 
promote its values in pursuit of its objectives.1161 As Sir Denis put it, “they are stewards of the 
reputation of the organisation.”1162

9.21  To that end, the report suggested that:1163 

“…  chief  officer  teams  should  review  their  corporate  governance  and  oversight 
arrangements to ensure that they were fulfilling their function in helping promote 
the values of their force and the delivery of its objectives, and that they were, through 
their actions and behaviours, promoting the values of the organisation and making 
sure good corporate governance was seen as a core part of everyday business.” 

Sir Denis elaborated on the key issues to be considered by forces in looking to manage the

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGrisks in this area:1164

“… there are patterns and lessons to be learnt in the way relationships can develop, 
and something that started relatively innocently can become more problematic. It’s 
bound  to be associated with  particular  kinds  of posts, the targeting  of individuals 
and particular kinds of posts, and with individuals’ own obligations, whether they’re 
financial – for example, currently it’s been assessed about 8.8 per cent of police officers 
and staff are financially stressed. There are ways of looking at people who work for 
your organisation and what they do, and looking at the potential to safeguard, as it 
were, them, to prevent things happening, and during the 1990s, when it was looked 
at in relation, as it were, to conventional corruption, criminal activity, they profiled 
the shape of this so that there was, if you like, an intelligence profile of the most 
vulnerable areas. I guess what we’re looking at is if you want to avoid conflicts of 
interest, if you want to avoid a slippery slope, it is worth considering how you profile 
vulnerabilities of your organisation and its relationships with whatever other people 
or sectors you engage with.”

Recommendations

9.22  HMIC stressed that at the heart of the issues that it considered within its review was the 
importance of integrity, both personal and organisational, which they say was evident and 
transparent  in  the  way  individuals  behaved  and  how  forces  and  authorities  conducted 
their  business.1165  It  was  against  this  backdrop  that  HMIC  made  the  following  principal 
recommendations:1166

•   “Forces  and  authorities  institute  robust  systems  to  ensure  risks  arising  from 
relationships,  information  disclosure,  gratuities,  hospitality,  contracting  and 
secondary  employment  are  identified.  Monitored  and  managed.  They  should 
ideally do so on the basis of national standards and expectations – there are no 
geographical variables when it comes to integrity and there should not be local 
differences in standards. This work on national standards should be encouraged 
by the Home Office and promoted by leaders in the Service locally.

•   There should be clear boundaries and thresholds in relation to these matters. 
Such limits should be consistent and Service wide. This in effect means identifying 
a  clear  message  for  staff  on  these  issues  as  to  what  is  acceptable,  what  is 
unacceptable and what areas of vulnerability to avoid. ACPO should lead this work 
in partnership with staff associations and those involved in police governance.

•   Training courses should include appropriate input in relation to integrity and 
anti-corruption. In particular, given the importance of leadership to securing high 
standards of integrity (a theme which runs through this review), the Strategic 
Command Course (in January 2012) and the High Potential Development Scheme 
should encompass these issues. Chief Constables should review how much effort 
is being put into briefing their staff on the standards as to what is acceptable, 
unacceptable and on the areas of potential vulnerability.

•   Chief  officer  teams  should  review  their  corporate  governance  and  oversight

helping promote the values of their force in the delivery of its objectives, and 
that they are, through their actions and behaviours, promoting the values of the 
organisation and making sure good corporate governance is seen as a core part 
of everyday business.

•   HMIC expects the Service to have detailed proposals in the above areas ready 

for consultation with all relevant parties by April 2012.

•   An  assessment  relating  to  these  matters  should  be  conducted  by  HMIC  by 
October 2012 to inform incoming Police and Crime Commissioners and Police 
and Crime Panels.”

9.23  Having received a draft version of the report in late November 2011, the Home Secretary 
wrote  to  Sir  Denis  on  6  December  2011  setting  out  her  initial  views  on  the  findings  and 
recommendations.  The  Home  Secretary  understandably  welcomed  HMIC’s  finding  that 
corruption  was  not  endemic  in  British  policing,  but  stressed  that,  more  generally,  the 
conclusions of his report presented an urgent wake up call for police leaders. She accepted 
the proposed recommendations of HMIC as “valuable steps” towards addressing the concerns 
raised by the review.1167 However, the Home Secretary also pushed for a greater sense of pace 
and urgency from the Police Service in developing more robust and consistent arrangements, 
and requested that a more direct challenge be made to current police leaders to make the point 
that dealing with the findings of the report was their personal responsibility, individually as 
well as collectively.1168 These two points were addressed within the final version of the report 
published  in  December  2011,  and  encapsulated  within  the  recommendations  reproduced 
above. 

9.24  Having identified a number of recommendations to tackle the issues identified by the HMIC 
report, in his evidence to the Inquiry Sir Denis synthesised the key steps that now needed to 
be taken by the Police Service to recalibrate its relationship with the media in this way:1169

“… I take the view that there does need to be a significant revision in the way the 
relationship operates, but I would absolutely want to reassert with you: not actually 
in  order  to  shrink  the  relationship  but  to  put  it  on  the  right  footing.  Now  getting 
it right means putting, to me, as a starter at least … some kind of framework for 
integrity in those dealings, which would have three components … These are some 
considerations in developing the right relationship, and I think that’s probably the 
best one can say about them, but they’re based on the idea that you put some kind of 
framework of integrity in place and then you support it in a number of ways … Three 
considerations in that would be: in their interactions with the media, there must be 
a legitimate policing purpose, whether it’s a constable or a chief constable, and it 
should be more than relationship-building and relate to the core values and standards 
of policing. That’s why I think it’s important to establish those values, standards … 
part of the challenge is there are several sets around from the attestation, which I 
think, if you are familiar with it, you know, is quite moving, all the way through to 
– covers professional conduct to a statement of professional values. My instinct is 
that they’re all worthy and as long as they crystallise what we hope from the police, 
they’re a reference point in whether you actually have a legitimate policing purpose, 
which is likely to prevent crime and help people and help the investigation, than not …

956

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGThe second consideration is how; the manner in which the relationship is conducted. 
In  essence,  I  think  it  should  operate  without  favouritism  and  with  integrity,  and  I 
say this is about integrity of the mission policing. So that kind of questions exclusive 
contact. It doesn’t eliminate it, but it questions it. So it has real bite in that sense, 
and it also accepts that because of the police mission to investigate, you will consider 
what’s presented to you, as it were, even if the media are presenting it to you as a 
real prospect. Now, what will need to happen underneath that is some very practical 
things for people who perhaps won’t have all the time to watch this Inquiry or read 
all  of  these  papers.  That  can  be  converted  –  “without  favourite,  with  integrity”  – 
to something a police force does about the range of contact it thinks is acceptable, 
about records, about briefing, authorisation … so it [is] establishing some boundaries 
… And then the third consideration is [how] the police handle information and access 
to it. They must seek to avoid a conflict of interest, given their obligations around 
confidentiality in particular but unexclusively. I think that those three points will help. 
If developed, can help. I’m quite prepared to accept – and there is a dialogue going on 
with people in the Police Service and elsewhere – that this actually may be a prompt 
for a better set of ideas, but they’re designed to be specific, although they may appear 
at first blush rather general …”

9.25  Sir Denis also suggested that there may need to be some mechanism whereby a police officer 
or member of police staff who was particularly concerned about an aspect of police behaviour 
(such as, for example, the suppression of an investigation) was able to report that concern 
and have it seriously considered without having to use the press as a vehicle to expose the 
wrongdoing.1170 The value of a route for whistle-blowing is that serious concerns could be 
addressed without prompting an allegation of disloyalty to the police although, ultimately, 
always leaving open the ability to go to the press in the public interest.

9.26  Sir Denis accepted that in providing an alternative route to raising concerns with the press, in 
parallel, the police would have to be more ready to admit where things had not gone as well 
as they might have done.1171 Sir Denis also accepted an obvious potential danger with such a 
system: that by moving to a stronger framework which tightened down the basis for contact, 
there was a risk of closing off an important avenue for revealing wrongdoing.1172 This “public 
interest safety valve process”1173 as it was described by Sir Denis, is obviously a very important 
part of what the press is in a position to achieve and one of the responsibilities that it has in 
our society: it is a role which I have no doubt that they should be able to continue to perform. 
This is an important issue and one to which it will be necessary to return in the concluding 
sections of this chapter. 

The response

9.27  The HMIC report and its recommendations have generally been well received and welcomed 
from  those  within  the  policing  world.  Commissioner  Hogan-Howe,  for  example,  told  the 
Inquiry that the MPS had “actively contributed to the HMIC review and welcomes the national 
picture their report provides”,1174 and Chief Constable Vaughan felt that it had been a “valuable

957

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGpublication within this area of business.”1175 Similarly, Lord Condon thought that the report 
was a “valuable contribution to the debate”1176 and Lord Stevens felt that it was “in the right 
space” with the challenge in its implementation.1177

9.28 

Julie Norgrove, the Director of Audit, Risk and Assurance for the Mayor’s Office for Policing 
and  Crime  (MOPC),  also  fully  endorsed  all  of  HMIC’s  principal  recommendations.1178  Ms 
Furniss for the IPCC expressed a degree of surprise that some of the recommendations were 
necessary given that, in her view, some of what was said “ought to have been fairly obvious” 
to the Police Service.1179 However, that point having being made, she said of the HMIC report’s 
recommendations  “given  that  it  clearly  has  been  necessary,  then  I  think  they  will  be  very 
helpful, actually.”1180 That is not to say that there were not concerns expressed at some of the 
recommendations, particularly in relation to the potential creation of additional bureaucratic 
burdens for the Police Service. Lord Blair for example was “reasonably content with the thrust 
of the recommendations”1181 but felt that they were overly complicated.1182 

9.29  As  could  perhaps  be  expected,  the  reaction  to  the  report  and  its  recommendations  from 
the media was mixed. Sandra Laville thought that the HMIC report highlighted some “very 
sensible broad principles for police forces”1183 and applauded its emphasis on integrity, both 
personal and organisational. She said:1184 

“If police forces can instil integrity and a strong moral compass into its police officers 
this is far more effective for tackling corruption than any amount of top down rules 
and regulations.” 

9.30  Sean O’Neill considered the report to be a “largely reasonable document”1185 but had strong 
views  on  the  recommendation  that  all  contact  between  police  officers  and  journalists  be 
formally noted; he suggested that this was “bureaucratic, unworkable and ultimately a threat 
to legitimate whistleblowing and freedom of expression.”1186 Jon Ungoed-Thomas shared this 
viewpoint, to the extent that he objected to the recording of contact between police officers 
and the media. He told the Inquiry:1187

“… some officers are already wary of dealing with journalists, and I think that the 
key  is  the  training  of  officers,  and  they  understand  the  parameters  in  which  they 
have exchanges with journalists. I think the difficulty is whenever you put in an audit

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGtrail,  for  whatever  it  is,  you  have  to  have  a  very,  very  good  understanding  of  the 
possible impact and the amount of work that it generates, and what I’m concerned 
at is that it will be easier for police officers just to say no, and not bother with the 
monitoring procedures, rather than just have a quick conversation with a journalist. 
For an organisation which is – ie the police, which is so reliant on an inflow of public 
information,  I  think  that  would  be  a  mistake  to  unnecessarily  restrict  exchanges 
between journalists and police officers, and I think that the consequence of that kind 
of mechanism would be a restriction of exchanges.” 

9.31 

John  Twomey  agreed  with  Mr  Ungoed-Thomas  and  felt  that  any  requirement  for  police 
officers to record their contact with journalists would “have kind of a freezing effect.”  1188 
James  Murray  was  even  more  strident  in  his  criticism;  he  argued  that  the  report  “lacked 
credibility  as  the  evidence  of  any  wrongdoing  between  journalists  and  the  police  was  not 
evident”.1189 In respect of the recommendations, he said that they:1190

“…  seem  overly  wordy  and  lacking  in  clarity.  My  view  is  that  police  officers  and 
journalists are sensible people who have intelligent interaction and both sides have 
high ethical standards … Sensible officers know what corruption is and will not need 
to go on a long course to be told what it is.” 

The  issue  of  recording  contact  between  police  officers  and  the  media  and  the  possible 
consequences of such a requirement is clearly extremely important, and one which is raised 
again  in  the  context  of  Elizabeth  Filkin’s  report  and  recommendations.  Again,  it  will  be 
necessary to return to it in the concluding section of this chapter.

9.32  ACPO is leading the response to the HMIC report on behalf of the Police Service1191 and, by 
October 2012, HMIC will have conducted a further assessment of the progress made by police 
forces and authorities in addressing the recommendations contained within the report.1192 In 
relation to the general response by the police to the issues raised by this report, and with an 
eye to the future, the Home Secretary said:1193

“... I’m very keen that ACPO take the lead in this, as they are now beginning to do. 
The only thing I would add is that of course, in the future, there will be a different 
structure  available  within  which  these  sorts  of  matters  can  be  considered  by  the 
police,  namely  the  police  professional  body  which  the  government  is  establishing, 
which will be established by the end of this year, which will be looking at standards 
across a whole range of activities in relation to policing, for police officers and police 
staff.”

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG10.	 Elizabeth	Filkin’s	review	of	the	relationship	between	

the MPS and the Media

10.1  After the fallout from the phone hacking that took place at the NoTW in July 2011, concerns 
were  raised  that  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service  (MPS)  may  have  failed  to  thoroughly 
investigate  the  matter,  particularly  after  the  discovery  that  the  practice  had  been  more 
widespread than initially perceived.1194 There was also much speculation regarding the ‘cosy’ 
relationships which existed between some senior MPS officers and NoTW journalists, and 
whether this was simply a general perception, or a matter of fact.1195 

10.2  With  these  concerns  in  mind,  the  then  Commissioner  of  the  MPS,  Sir  Paul  Stephenson, 
appointed Elizabeth Filkin to conduct a review into the relationship between the MPS and 
the media.1196 Mrs Filkin has explained to the Inquiry that these concerns were “largely the 
reason that Sir Paul Stephenson had invited me to do this piece of work, it was obviously 
very pertinent to the piece of work”.1197 The perception issue was of key importance for the 
MPS, who felt that the relationship between the force and the media had damaged public 
confidence in the MPS. Mrs Filkin has said in this regard that the MPS were:1198 

“… embarrassed by much of the coverage, who were concerned that it might turn out 
to be true, who felt that they had done their duty throughout their careers and this 
was being now seriously undermined, and they were worried that public trust would 
be undermined.”

10.3  As such, the purpose of Mrs Filkin’s review was to provide recommendations to Sir Paul and 
the MPS Management Board, in relation to: general issues around the ethics of police and 
media relationships; the purpose of this relationship across all levels in the MPS; methods 
of improving public confidence in police and media relations; the issue of transparency of 
such relations; the rules and acceptance of hospitality between the police and the media; 
and whether any evidence in relation to any of these issues should be led by the MPS to this 
Inquiry.1199

10.4  Although Mr Stephenson and the then Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, resigned shortly 
after the commission of the report, Mrs Filkin commenced with her work in August 2011 
under the oversight of the incoming Commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe.1200 The final report 
was published and presented to the MPS on 5 January 2012.1201

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGThe Filkin Report: the ethical issues arising from the relationship 
between police and media 

10.5  Mrs Filkin conducted her evidence gathering process over the course of five months. This 
process  comprised  of  interviews  with  a  range  of  sources  across  the  Metropolitan  Police; 
stakeholders within the newspaper industry; as well as politicians  and reputable business 
individuals. Mrs Filkin has told the Inquiry to this effect that:1202

“I put out a request on the internal intranet for the Metropolitan Police asking anybody 
within the Metropolitan Police who would like to give me information, evidence or 
opinion to be in contact with me, either in writing or in person, and I offered to do 
that in confidence if people wished that. I requested interviews with a range of people 
across the Metropolitan Police Service, all of whom I’m very pleased to say agreed to 
be interviewed by me, and I did the same with a list … … who were journalists, editors, 
politicians, business people, who I though might have something to give me. I also 
sat down with a number of internal groups in the Metropolitan Police ... a range of 
staff groups, of different groups, different ethnic backgrounds, et cetera, to get their 
opinions, too.”

10.6  As well as gathering evidence from these interviews with 137 people, and the consideration 
of  written  material,  Mrs  Filkin  also  consulted  with  MPS  officers  working  on  Operations 
Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta; and this Inquiry. She told the Inquiry that she exercised “my 
own judgement about whether people were trustworthy when I talked to them.”1203 These 
interviews were presented as confidential conversations, and Mrs Filkin has only attributed 
quotes to those interviewed, with their consent, in her final report. Where she has questioned 
the validity of some of the views expressed through her interviews, Mrs Filkin has made this 
clear in the report. She told the Inquiry that:1204

“… as you will have seen, a large number of people did allow me to attribute their 
quotations to them, but some did not. And I have respected that, but I didn’t quote 
people without making any comment about it where I didn’t think – I didn’t support 
people  unless  I  thought  that  what  they  were  saying  was  trustworthy.  That  didn’t 
mean to say I didn’t also include some quotes from people whose views I did not 
accept.”

10.7  Mrs Filkin has also explained to the Inquiry that her report sought to consult as wide a view as 
possible, in order to ensure that the evidence was representative across the board, particularly 
given that there were different opinions held by the media and the MPS on the key findings of 
her report. She has stressed to the Inquiry that the report is entirely a reflection of her own 
findings.

Summary of key findings

10.8  The Filkin Report conveyed four key issues which became evident over the course of Mrs 
Filkin’s  research.  These  issues  were  reported  to  the  MPS  Management  Board  and  the 
Commissioner’s Policy Forum at the time of her Inquiry. They covered:1205

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG•   “The  core  principles  to  be  established  to  govern  the  relationships  between  the 

MPS and the media.

•   The  changes  necessary  to  the  leadership  and  management  of  the  MPS  to  put 

these into practice. 

•  The changes necessary to the Directorate of Public Affairs (DPA).
•   The prevention of unethical relationships between the police and the media in the 

future.”

10.9  Mrs Filkin has described the key problems around the perception of leaks from the MPS to the 
media, interlinked with the ‘cosy’ relationships which have developed between the two. She 
concluded that this disclosure of information; the context of the relationship which fosters this 
disclosure; and the extent to which these relationships are regulated, should be addressed 
by the MPS in order to ensure complete oversight of an ethical practice, which would restore 
any damage to the public trust.1206 She elaborated on the issue of excessive hospitality and 
favours to the Inquiry, and reflected the view of many of the lower ranks within the MPS, in 
relation to the relevantly recent introduction of hospitality register publication:1207

“…  many  of  the  police  officers  and  staff  that  I  interviewed  were  obviously  highly 
shocked by the amount of hospitality that the senior people appeared to be receiving; 
either hospitality in the sorts of things of dinners and lunches and so forth at rather 
expensive restaurants, but also some of them were receiving very large numbers of 
tickets to very expensive sporting events, so there were a set of things which some 
senior people had been receiving, others had not, others had not accepted, and that 
was clear.”

The issue of perception was raised again in this respect, as Mrs Filkin explained that “people 
across  the  Met  saw  these  things  all  as  one  and  thought  they  should  all  be  described  as 
corruption”.1208 

10.10  In addressing these issues, Mrs Filkin produced seven key findings and recommendations, 
which focussed on: the methods of communication between the MPS and the public; the 
infrastructure within the MPS for such communications; corporate issues including leadership 
and trust within the MPS, as well as the management of ethical issues; the core principles 
outlining methods of contact with the media; and the transparency, and prevention of further 
unethical practices.1209

10.11  Mrs Filkin concluded that there was too much reliance on the print media by the MPS, which 
has affected the impartiality and independence of the force in the public eye.1210 The role of 
the Directorate of Public Affairs (DPA) has also come under scrutiny through the interviews 
conducted  for  the  report.  Mrs  Filkin  has  expressed  her  concerns  about  the  reluctance  of 
information provision to the DPA, which have been shaped by two particular perceptions. 
She  reported  that  there  is  a  view  that  “the  DPA  is  unwilling  in  some  instances  to  provide 
information to the public. Secondly that information is sometimes misused”. Mrs Filkin has

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGargued  that  the  current  infrastructure  of  communications  is  damaging  any  attempts  at  a 
“transparent corporate response in providing information to the public”.1211

10.12  The  report  has  also  recognised  a  disparity  in  rules  for  senior  leaders  and  lower  ranks  of 
police officers, in relation to the policy of receiving gifts and hospitality from the media. The 
report found that there “has been no clear standard set by the senior team for police officers 
and staff to use as a guide for their own behaviour and in some instances the standards set 
have  been  poor  and  have  led  to  consequent  damage.”1212  This  particular  issue  was  noted 
as a requirement for a change in the culture across the MPS, with clearer systems in place 
to  monitor  the exchange of  hospitality  between the  media  and  the  police.  In  this  regard, 
the report also found that there has been a lack of consistent leadership in relation to the 
handling of information between the MPS and the media, particular the increased risk of 
“improper disclosure to the media”.1213 

10.13  In her summary of findings, Mrs Filkin has referred to the problems identified by Sir Denis 
O’Connor’s  report  on  the  review  of  police  relationships.  She  has  argued  that  the  MPS 
should map ethical risks in order to “keep such issues consistently on the agenda”.1214 This 
would  improve  the  corporate  management  of  the  MPS  and  provide  guidance  to  staff  for 
understanding appropriate conduct when faced with decisions on their interactions with the 
media. 

10.14  As  well  as  the  issue  of  leadership  and  corporate  management,  the  report  concluded  that 
the lack of transparency has also fuelled the perception that the relationship between the 
MPS and the media is secretive in nature. Mrs Filkin has reported on the fear expressed by 
journalists in relation to the suggestion for a greater degree of transparency in their contact 
with the police. Some, such as Nick Davies, have argued that this transparency risks stifling 
genuine investigative journalism in the public interest. Mrs Filkin has told the Inquiry that this 
is “a real fear, and certainly journalists have expressed it very forcefully to me.”1215

10.15  Lastly, Mrs Filkin concluded on the issue of prevention. Some of the sources she interviewed 
for  the  purpose  of  the  report  have  expressed  their  views  that  the  culture  of  leaks  within 
the  MPS  is  generally  tolerated  by  the  force.  Mrs  Filkin  adds  that  she  “accept[s]  that  leak 
investigations are costly and often unproductive”.1216 In this regard, Mrs Filkin has said that 
officers would welcome a “stronger stance” in the challenging, publication and deterrence of 
improper disclosure to the media.

Recommendations of the Filkin Report

10.16  In light of the key findings of the report, Mrs Filkin has made the following recommendations 
to Commissioner Hogan-Howe and the MPS Management Board, in response to the terms of 
reference set out at para 10.3 above:1217

•   “A new approach to communication based on more extensive, open and impartial 
provision of information to the public is needed. Relationships with the media need

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGto be part of this but not the driving force. I recommend that the Commissioner 
delegates responsibility and resources to a member of his senior team to champion 
a  new  approach  to  providing  public  information.  Increasing  openness  with  the 
public should be monitored through performance indicators.

•   The MPS senior team must signal a change in culture and set a consistent example 
for all staff on the ethical standards they expect, including how they relate to the 
media and the interpretation of the gifts and hospitality register.

•   I recommend that the Commissioner delegates responsibility and resources to a 
member  of  his  senior  team  to  initiate  change  in  the  way  the  MPS  approaches 
integrity  and  ethics  issues  at  all  levels.  This  role  will  provide  the  support  and 
direction for staff to implement change and ensure improvements are tracked. This 
role holder will collaborate with the Public Information Champion. Responsibility 
for leadership on these issues is shared by all as peer pressure is the most effective 
way of improving behaviour.

•   I recommend that all police officers and staff who provide information to the media 
should make a brief personal record of the information they provide. This record 
should be available if required by a line manager. Some of these records will be 
audited on a random basis. Wherever possible, published information should be 
attributed to the person giving it or more generally to the MPS.

•   The MPS must establish the core principles which should underpin contact with 
the  media.  I  recommend  that  contact  with  the  media  is  permissible  but  not 
unconditional. This should be the overarching principle. Police officers and staff 
need to have new guidance that helps them understand the value of providing 
information  to  the  public  and  supports  them  in  making  ethical  decisions  when 
doing  so.  Advice  on  contact  with  the  media  is  an  essential  part  of  this.  So  are 
improved  training,  supervision  and  appraisal  to  ensure  the  principles  become 
embedded.

•   The  MPS  must  reinforce  the  public  service  responsibilities  of  the  Directorate  of 
Public Affairs (DPA) and local communications work. These functions must operate 
collaboratively and with equal status. The MPS must make better use of alternative 
routes for communicating with the public and there must be a predisposition to 
release much more information than in the past both to the external and internal 
audience.

•   The  MPS  must  create  an  environment  where  the  improper  disclosure  of 
information is condemned and deterred. Senior managers should make messages 
of deterrence strong and effective. Where leaks cannot be proved to the evidential 
standard required for a criminal prosecution, robust management action should 
nevertheless be pursued. However, whether there has been genuine harm should 
always be assessed before proportionate action is taken. Investigations should be 
seen as an important but subsidiary part of a broader preventative approach.”

MPS response to the Filkin Report

10.17  The  Filkin  report  and  its  specific  recommendations  have  been  positively  received  by  the 
Metropolitan Police Service. Commissioner Hogan-Howe confirmed that the MPS would be 

964

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGimplementing the recommendations set out by Mrs Filkin. He has told the Inquiry that the 
report is:1218

“… being considered by the new Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey, who will provide 
an organisational response. This means that all the current policies concerning contact 
with the media and hospitality are to be reviewed and, as appropriate, amended to 
address  the  recommendations  made  in  the  Filkin  Report.  Fundamentally  I  want  a 
principle of openness to be established. If we communicate with the press we need to 
be open about it, explain what contact there is and why.”

10.18  In his evidence to the Inquiry, he also expanded on the MPS’s response to the report and 
said specifically that “we accept the findings. The conclusion that Elizabeth Filkin draws, we 
accept”.1219 He explained that there would be some practical discussions in relation to the 
implementation of these recommendations. In this regard, the MPS are:1220

“… doing a little more work just to make sure that we operationalise that, and there 
was an appendix to Elizabeth’s work which was trying to make more practical some 
of the principled findings. There are one or two areas in that which probably we want 
to discuss a little more before we actually say that we accept that in total, but on the 
whole the broad thrust of the report we accept.”

Media response to the Filkin Report

10.19  There have, however, been some criticisms by the media in response to the Filkin Report. Sean 
O’Neill, the crime editor of The Times, has strongly disapproved of the recommendations and 
the general tone of the report, using the term “East German Ministry of Information”1221 as a 
description of the language used by Mrs Filkin. He disagreed with the overall recommendations 
which “give more power over the control of information, which it calls transparency.”1222 Mr 
O’Neill  specifically  questions  the  accountability  of  the  senior  officers,  who  are  “the  same 
senior  officer  class  who  have  brought  all  these  problems  upon  the  Met’s  head  in  the  first 
place. It doesn’t seem to me a sensible course of action.”1223 He has said that the report has 
already contributed to a climate of fear and discouraged police officers, making them afraid 
of talking to the press. 

10.20  Mr O’Neill also elaborated on how the report has perceived women reporters, and has told 
the Inquiry that, “if I were a female crime correspondent I would be furious, because it seems 
to imply they’re just a bunch of women in short skirts who are out flirting with people, and 
I don’t think that’s the case.”1224 John Twomey, crime reporter of the Daily Express, has also 
told the Inquiry that the ‘ideas for practical guidance’ were largely condescending and “didn’t

there’s some condescending remarks about women in there.”1226 

10.21  Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe has firmly disagreed with the suggestions that the Filkin 
report has been ‘patronising’ or ‘condescending’ to police officers, and has told the Inquiry 
that:1227

“… I didn’t take it in that way, and I thought it was written in a sensible style and 
encouraged people to think differently about something that had become a problem. 
So I couldn’t see that myself. I didn’t take it as patronising for police officers, but I 
can’t speak really, I suppose, for the journalists who did.”

11.	 Association	of	Chief	Police	Officers	(ACPO)
11.1  Sir Huge Orde, President of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), in describing the 
body’s  functions,  said:  “ACPO  brings  together  the  expertise  and  experience  of  chief  police 
officers from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It provides a professional forum to share 
ideas and best practice, coordinate resources and help deliver effective policing which keeps 
the public safe.”1228 

11.2  ACPO is an independent, professionally-led strategic body.1229 Sir Hugh explained that in the 
public interest, and in equal and active partnership with Government and the Association of 
Police Authorities (APA) (although in relation to the APA, the position will change with the 
election of Police and Crime Commissioners in November 2012), ACPO leads and coordinates 
the direction and development of the Police Service in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
The Police and Justice Act 2006 confirms ACPO as a statutory consultee, and, as Sir Hugh 
explained:

“… We are a company limited by guarantee. We had to have some legal position so 
we can employ people and rent buildings, for example, but the office of president is 
also enshrined in primary legislation in the Police Act 2002 but apart from that we 
have no statutory basis.”1230 

11.3  Sir  Hugh  described  the  functions  of  ACPO  as  including  the  facilitation  of  decision  making 
by  Chief  Constables  at  a  national  level.  It  also  provides  national  policing  coordination, 
national policing communication, the national development of professional policing practice 
and  oversight,  through  chief  officers,  to  some  national  policing  units.  Sir  Hugh  explained 
that in the absence of a federal model of policing ACPO “provides a voluntary structure to 
secure national agreements which underpin the ability of all forces to deliver consistent and 
interoperable policing to keep citizens safe and secure.”1231 It is worthy of mention that ACPO’s

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGcurrent role and responsibilities are subject to change as the Government plans to introduce 
a new professional body for policing. Sir Hugh reported that it was not yet clear how ACPO’s 
functions will be delivered in this new landscape but until that point it will continue in their 
current guise.1232 

11.4  ACPO is currently composed of 340 chief officers holding a rank at or above Assistant Chief 
Constable (or the MPS equivalent: Commander). It also includes senior police staff colleagues 
of equivalent status, for example heads of human resources and finance, and in some forces 
the heads of communication and legal services.1233

11.5  The ACPO membership elects a full-time President, who holds the office of constable and 
the  rank  of  Chief  Constable  under  the  Police  Reform  Act  2002.1234  Sir  Hugh  was  elected 
President of ACPO in 2009: the term of office is four years and the incumbent cannot stand 
for re-election.1235 As President, Sir Hugh chairs a Council of Chief Constables and acts as the 
spokesperson for the profession of policing on national issues.1236 Sir Hugh described how his 
responsibilities differed from that of the MPS Commissioner, for example:

“… I have no operational responsibility or indeed authority at all. My job is to really 
bring together and through negotiation … get consistent national policies through 
what  we  call  the  Chief  Constables’  Council,  which  meets  four  times  a  year  …  My 
only technical operational responsibility, for example, if the fuel strike comes off, I 
will be responsible for making sure government is fully informed through Cobra and 
the Cabinet Office briefing room and my office will be responsible for co-ordinating 
any necessary movements of police officers around the country, as happened in the 
serious disturbances in August and as will happen in the pre-planned events around 
the Olympics. We co-ordinate the movement but the movement is given permission 
or authority by individual chief constables.”1237

11.6  As Sir Hugh made clear, each police force operates independently of one another and manages 
communications with the media in respect of its own local policing. The role of ACPO is to 
provide a national voice for the Police Service to “explain, inform and defend the operational 
work of the police service to cut crime and protect life.”1238 Sir Hugh described this role in 
more detail:

“It’s very much providing a facility that enables the national media to go … to a single 
point of contact on matters that are of national interest, so in that sense we try and 
support the local forces where necessary. ACPO itself I describe very much as almost 
a band of volunteers. The business area work which is undertaken by chief constables 
… is to try and provide continuity, consistency and at the top end of our business, 
a  consistent  approach  to  the  serious  threats  this  country  faces,  be  it  terrorism, 
international  crime,  public  order,  those  sorts  of  issues,  where  you  have  to  have  a

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGconsistent approach.”1239

11.7  There are 14 of the business areas referred to above within ACPO, covering 336 separate 
policing functions or types of crime (known as ‘portfolios’ within ACPO) that are nationally 
led and coordinated by a Chief Officer. Sir Hugh explained that the Chief Officer led ‘portfolios’ 
cover  “every  sphere  of  police  activity  from  police  use  of  firearms  to  metal  theft  and  are 
supported  inside  and  outside  the  police  service  by  an  ACPO  communications  team  which 
responds to national media enquiries concerning policing and crime reduction.”1240 Sir Hugh 
went on to explain that the ACPO portfolio lead, through his or her national role, can draw on 
policing colleagues of all ranks and that with their support they can “offer an informed view 
on behalf of the police service as a whole, rather than a single force.”1241 

11.8  ACPO has its own press office which works in support of the body’s national communications 
role. Sir Hugh said that the press office works in close cooperation with “police force press 
offices  but  takes  the  lead  in  supporting  the  police  service’s  strategic  response  to  national 
policing issues.”1242 In expanding on this point, he said:

“It’s very important that I’m very keen that the president of ACPO, whoever holds this 
position, doesn’t speak on all policing matters, we simply don’t have the capacity to 
have a detailed knowledge. But what we do have for example are 14 business areas, 
for  example  crime  is  run  currently  by  the  chief  constable  of  Merseyside,  uniform 
operations matters is run by the chief constable of Norfolk. So if there was a matter 
pertaining to their specialism I would defer or my press officer would certainly make 
sure that someone from that business area was available to the national media to 
speak with authority on behalf of the association but with the depth of knowledge 
that’s required to give a proper and informed answer.”1243

11.9  ACPO also continues to play a coordinating role across areas of policing where the national 
interest  requires  that  “police  forces  act  together  and  agree  joint  strategies.”1244  Sir  Hugh 
explained  that  this  allows  for  Chief  Constables  to  come  together  and  develop  a  “single 
approach nationally, being cheaper and more efficient than developing 44 strategies across 
each police force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.”1245 However, he pointed out that 
any national approaches remain subject to the “local interpretation and implementation of 
operationally independent Chief Constables.”1246 Furthermore, each individual Chief Constable 
remains entirely responsible for delivering at the local level; Sir Hugh argued therefore that it 
makes sense “that a single voice for the service is available at the national level to explain the 
strategic implications of such policies.”1247 

11.10  It  is  also  important  to  make  clear  at  this  stage  that  although  national  policing  practice 
produced through ACPO is endorsed through the Chief Constables Council, its status remains 
one of guidance. As Sir Hugh made clear, ACPO has no role in securing compliance and any

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGguidance produced does not “supersede decisions of Chief Constables who are operationally 
responsible for the direction and control of policing within their own force area.”1248 

11.11  Given  its  national  coordination  role,  ACPO  was  tasked  with  providing  the  Police  Service 
response to the recommendations contained within HMIC’s report: ‘Without fear or favour 
– a review of police relationships’ (“the HMIC report”), which was published in December 
2011.1249 One of the key themes running through HMIC’s recommendations was the need for 
national standards to ensure consistency of practice across individual force areas. The Home 
Secretary expanded on this point and said: 

“…  What  obviously  became  clear,  particularly  from  the  work  that  I  commissioned 
from HMIC, was the variation in guidance that was being issued and being operated, 
and variation in systems that were being operated from police force to police force. 
The importance of a police force being able – and a chief constable being able within 
his  police  force  –  to  have  that  independence  of  deciding  how  that  force  operates 
is part of the structure of policing that we have in the UK. Obviously, having now 
looked at the situation, the chief officers following HMIC’s report have felt that it is 
appropriate to put some more national guidance in place, but that obviously will still 
be operated by each of the police forces.”1250 

11.12  Sir Hugh concurred with this assessment. He said:1251 

“…  There’s  always  a  tension  between,  you  know,  the  clear  steer  of  the  current 
government towards a local bespoke style of policing and localism and driving down 
responsibility and there’s always that tension between local agendas, local policies, 
local procedures, and the national central agenda. So it’s always a robust debate. I 
think certainly within the Police Service there’s common agreement, it makes absolute 
sense that you can have one consistent approach, for example in relation to gifts and 
hospitality. The public will not understand why the standards are different across the 
country …”1252 In relation to ACPO taking the lead on the Police Service’s response 
to the HMIC report, he made the point that: “… ACPO can mobilise quite quickly in 
response to HMI, for example, when it’s seen as critical to delivering a new policy, a 
new consistent policy which is important in terms of public confidence …”

11.13  Sir Hugh reported that the main element of the ACPO response relating to Police Service 
integrity and corruption was being led through the national lead for Professional Standards, 
Chief  Constable  Mike  Cunningham.  The  ACPO  response  to  those  HMIC  recommendations 
which specifically dealt with media relationships has been addressed under the leadership of 
Chief Constable Andy Trotter.1253 I will deal with each in turn.

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGACPO’s response to the HMIC Report: ‘Without Fear or Favour – A Review of Police 
Relationships’

11.14  Mike Cunningham was appointed as the Chief Constable of Staffordshire Police in 2009 and 
he took the lead of the ACPO Professional Standards Portfolio in June 2011 – this portfolio 
sits within the Workforce Development Business Area of ACPO.1254 Mr Cunningham explained 
that the Professional Standards Portfolio “is dedicated to raising and maintaining professional 
standards in the police service.”1255 Given its centrality to the issues at hand, Mr Cunningham 
set out in broad terms his remit as portfolio lead:

“(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

(iv) 

(v) 

strategic responsibility to identify and address emerging threats and respond to national 
issues which impact on the police service’s professional standards
leading for ACPO on the development of preventative strategies to combat risk and 
emerging threats to operational policing and the reputation of the police service
receiving  and  commissioning  the  work  of  the  three  Professional  Standards  Portfolio 
sub-groups, (Complaints and Misconduct, Counter Corruption, and Vetting). To address 
strategic  issues  and  challenges  in  response  to  the  ACPO  &  Serious  Organised  Crime 
Agency  (SOCA)  National  Strategic  Threat  Assessment  to  UK  Law  Enforcement  from 
Corruption
identifying commonality with other ACPO business areas, (such as the Ethics portfolio), 
where reducing instances of and improved handling of public complaints can achieve 
improved public satisfaction and confidence through the quality of service provision, 
and  overseeing  the  integration  of  professional  standards  issues  into  the  strategies, 
policies and procedures of other business areas as appropriate
identifying  opportunities  to  more  closely  integrate  unsatisfactory  performance  of 
officers and staff into professional standards, with a clear emphasis on ethical policing 
behaviour  as  opposed  to  mere  compliance  with  regulations,  and  to  improve  public 
confidence in the police service through organisational learning

(vi)  monitoring ethical standards as they relate to aspects of policing such as the use of 
discretion, case management and the administration of justice, the use of force and 
other policing powers, custody and detention matters, gifts and gratuities, secondary 
employment and business interests, information confidentiality, personal standards of 
conduct and cooperation with partner agencies.”1256 

11.15  In  discharging  these  responsibilities,  Mr  Cunningham  chairs  a  quarterly  meeting  of  the 
ACPO Professional Standards Portfolio which comprises the chief officer leads of the ACPO 
Complaints  and  Misconduct  Working  Group,  ACPO  Counter  Corruption  Advisory  Group 
(ACCAG) and the ACPO Vetting Group together with staff association leads. The Independent 
Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is represented by the Chief Executive – Special advisers 
from within the service are invited as appropriate.1257 

11.16  Mr Cunningham explained that the ACCAG Guidance for the Investigation of Corruption (first 
published in 2003, formally revised in 2006 and currently under review) identifies a number 
of common factors as potential corrupters. These include “former police officers, particularly 
those in the security or private investigation sectors, family members and friends with criminal

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGassociations, informants and other criminal contacts established through policing activity.”1258 
Mr Cunningham confirmed that the media was also identified as a source of corruption when 
“confidential, sensitive or secret information is sought by journalists, in return for financial 
inducements or payment through gifts and hospitality.”1259 Mr Cunningham went on to explain 
that what are described as ‘payments through gifts and hospitality’ was not in itself identified 
as a significant risk.1260 He expanded on this point and said:

“… The assessment has identified that the police officers have broadly two commodities 
with which they would trade, if I could put it that way. One is influence and the other 
is information. It seems from a chief officer from ACPO perspective that we need to 
put safeguards in place in order to handle safely the information that we hold and the 
relationships that officers have and develop, which could become corrupt. And so in 
terms of assessing the risk, the unauthorised handling of information is a significant 
risk  for  the  service.  And  that’s  been  identified  in  the  SOCA  strategic  assessment 
of  corruption.  In  order  to  deal  with  the  handling  of  information  and  protecting 
information, a number of safeguards have been put in place … but contingent upon 
all of those are relationships which officers subsequently develop. Family and friends 
was identified as the highest risk in terms of the unlawful disclosure of information. 
Former colleagues, particularly those in the private security industry, was also a risk. 
At  the  point  in  which  the  strategic  assessment  was  done  in  the  summer  of  2010, 
journalists were identified as a risk, but not as high as those other groups.”1261 

11.17  In relation to the identified risk of family and friends and the unlawful disclosure of information, 
Mr Cunningham confirmed that this would on occasions be inadvertent disclosure, but “… 
On other occasions it would be criminal. So there are examples of … an officer checking out 
the daughter’s new boyfriend through to officers who have criminals who are part of their 
family and actively seeking intelligence and information from police systems and passing that 
on.”1262 

11.18  Specifically in relation to gifts and gratuities, Mr Cunningham explained that the policies in 
place were intended to provide instruction and guiding principles to enable staff to make 
“correct decisions and to act in compliance with widely recognised Standards of Professional 
Behaviour as described in the Schedule to the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008 and related 
Home  Office  guidance  (026/2008)  on  police  unsatisfactory  performance  and  misconduct 
procedures, and Standards of Professional Behaviour for Police Staff, as agreed by the Police 
Staff Council (PSC).”1263 The relevant standards for police officers and police staff are described 
under the heading relating to Honesty and Integrity. Given their relevance I will reproduce 
the section in full: 

“Police  officers  never  accept  any  gift  or  gratuity  that  could  compromise  their 
impartiality. During the course of their duties police officers may be offered hospitality 
(e.g. refreshments) and this may be acceptable as part of their role. However, police 
officers  always  consider  carefully  the  motivation  of  the  person  offering  a  gift  or 
gratuity of any type and the risk of becoming improperly beholden to a person or 
organisation.

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGIt is not anticipated that inexpensive gifts would compromise the integrity of a police 
officer, such as those from conferences (e.g. promotional products) or discounts aimed 
at  the  entire  police  force  (e.g.  advertised  discounts  through  police  publications). 
However,  all  gifts  and  gratuities  must  be  declared  in  accordance  with  local  force 
policy where authorisation may be required from a manager, Chief Officer or Police 
Authority to accept a gift or hospitality. If a police officer is in any doubt then they 
should seek advice from their manager.”1264

11.19  This guidance has been adopted by all police forces, including the MPS.1265 Mr Cunningham 
also  confirmed  that  all  forces  have  mechanisms  by  which  advice  and  guidance  on 
interpretation can be provided.1266 He said that “there are formal regional structures for Heads 
of Professional Standards Departments which underpin and support each of the three ACPO 
Professional Standards Portfolio working groups. In addition, the Police Federation and the 
Police Superintendents’ Association of England and Wales (PSAEW) have misconduct leads 
and Panel of Friends with an ability to seek guidance from and to influence the formulation 
of policy and procedure to drive forward improvements in professional standards.”1267 Any 
breach of the standards set out above would be deemed a disciplinary offence, which “… 
would be measured against the standard, in the police conduct regulations, and the guidance 
… would assist the person who’s making a judgment in relation to that breach in order to form 
a view as to the severity of that breach.”1268

11.20  In leading on the response by ACPO to the HMIC report ‘Without Fear or Favour – A Review 
of Police Relationships’, Mr Cunningham confirmed that three principal sets of guidance were 
being developed to address the report’s recommendations; the first relates to the acceptance 
of  gifts  and  hospitality;  the  second  relates  to  officers  taking  secondary  employment  or 
having business interests; and the third relates to the police’s relationship with the press and 
the media, on which Chief Constable Andy Trotter is leading.1269 Mr Cunningham candidly 
admitted that the delivery of national guidance would be a “challenge for the service.”1270 He 
expanded on this point and said:

“… We clearly, I think, acknowledge and agree with HMIC that national guidance is 
required in these areas … What will be a challenge will be to phrase that guidance in 
such a way as it can be applied to very different circumstances in different places. It 
needs to be sufficiently high level to be applicable to those different circumstances, 
yet sufficiently detailed to be meaningful. That’s the balance we’re trying to strike.”1271 

11.21  ACPO also clearly recognised that the issues raised by HMIC’s report were important ones for 

the Police Service as a whole. Mr Cunningham said:

“… ACPO is approaching these issues with real energy and the reason for that is we 
do recognise that the issues under examination at the moment have potential and 
have been immensely damaging to public confidence. Immensely damaging to the 
relationship upon which we build effective policing. Because of that corrosive nature 
of the issues that we’re dealing with, we need to approach this very quickly. We are

who have scrutinised the police agree that corruption and malpractice is not endemic 
or systemic. However, the actions of individuals, particularly senior individuals, has 
been and can be highly damaging. That’s why we need to act with the urgency with 
which we’re addressing this.”1272 

11.22  On 11 May 2012, Mr Cunningham wrote to the Home Secretary to provide her with an update 
on ACPO’s response to the HMIC report. He reported that following a meeting on 20 April 
2012, Chief Constable’s Council had “strongly endorsed a comprehensive paper addressing 
HMIC’s main recommendations.”1273 A copy of the paper was annexed for her information. 
Furthermore, Mr Cunningham said that following a meeting with the former Chief Inspector of 
the Constabulary, Sir Denis O’Connor, and Her Majesty’s Inspector of the Constabulary Roger 
Baker on 3 May 2012 to discuss the ongoing work, he was “pleased to report an encouraging 
endorsement of the paper, its content, the guidance we have adopted and are continuing to 
develop, and the direction of travel.”1274 

11.23  I have already dealt in more detail with the HMIC report and its recommendations elsewhere 
(see section 9 above). In summary form, the first two principal recommendations related to 
the institution of robust systems to identify, monitor and manage the risks identified in the 
report on the basis of national standards and expectations, and the need for the expression 
of  clear,  consistent  and  service  wide  boundaries  and  thresholds  of  acceptability.1275  The 
ACPO  response  paper  records  that  “significant  consultative  work  has  taken  place  (and  is 
set to continue) with key stakeholders, including HMIC, the Home Office, Staff Associations, 
the IPCC, and the APA. Over the course of the past months, heads of professional standards 
departments and chief officers with delegated responsibility as Appropriate Authority have 
been increasingly focused on more robust governance of the risks from the matters reported 
upon in without Fear or Favour.”1276

11.24  The  ACPO  response  paper  further  records  that  “three  specific  guidance  documents  have 
been drawn up to assist and inform decision making within and between forces … which will 
engender a consistency of approach in defining and establishing boundaries of acceptable 
practice over matters of personal and professional integrity.”1277 The first piece of guidance 
referred  to  relates  to  the  management  of  business  interests  and  additional  occupations 
for  police  officers  and  police  staff.  The  ACPO  response  paper  notes  that  a  “more  robust 
decision making framework has been prepared” to promote a consistency of approach to 
the approval and regulation of business interests and additional occupations.1278 Importantly, 
the  framework  makes  clear  that  “adverse  reputational  impact”  is  the  key  and  over-riding 
consideration for decision makers, rather than “personnel or health and safety factors” as 
was previously the case.1279 

11.25  Further changes to the guidance previously in place include “a more definitive confirmation 
that  the  decision  maker  on  the  approval  of  business  interests  should  be  the  appropriate 
authority  or  head  of  professional  standards.”1280  The  updated  guidance  in  this  area  also

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseGprovides  “a  more  specific  set  of  criteria  to  assist  decision  making  which  should  be  taken 
into  account  when  determining  the  appropriateness  of  a  prospective  business  interest  or 
secondary occupation for compatibility with the role or duty of the officer or member of staff, 
namely impartiality (predicted, expected or evidenced); impact on the force (potential and 
perceptions); the applicant’s current performance, proportionality (in relation to seniority and 
role); equality and diversity; and health, safety and well-being.”1281 Finally, it is said that the 
revised guidance simplifies the previously overly bureaucratic procedures relating to the right 
of appeal against non-approval of a business interest.1282 The ACPO response paper makes 
clear that the guidance in this area is “currently subject to further and final consultation in the 
Police Advisory Board working party.”1283

11.26  In relation to the issue of gifts, gratuities and hospitality, the ACPO response paper reports 
that “for the first time, ACPO guidance has been drafted to provide a more consistent service-
wide approach” to this issue.1284 Fundamentally, the guidance is based on a shift to a “blanket 
non-acceptability save for certain circumstances of a common sense approach to the provision 
of light refreshments, and trivial and inexpensive gifts of bona fide and genuine gratitude 
from victims or communities.”1285 The guidance also makes clear the expectation that a single 
force register of gifts and hospitality will exist under the direct “governance and scrutiny” of 
the head of professional standards.1286 

11.27  The key guiding principles governing the acceptance of gifts, gratuities and hospitality are 
mandated within the revised guidance. The guidance, for example, reminds police officers and 
police staff that they should “demonstrate the highest standards of professional behaviour, 
honesty and integrity. In particular they should not compromise or abuse their position by 
soliciting  the  offer  of  gifts,  gratuities,  favours  or  hospitality  in  any  way  connected  to,  or 
arising from, their role within the police service, whether on or off duty.”1287 Furthermore, the 
guidance states that “police officers and police staff should not accept the offer of any gift, 
gratuity, favour or hospitality unless it complies with the circumstances and considerations as 
set out [within the guidance]  … as to do so might compromise their impartiality or give rise to 
a perception of such compromise.”1288 Importantly in my view, the guidance also makes clear 
that the offer of a gift, gratuity or hospitality should be declared “irrespective of whether or 
not it is accepted or rejected by the recipient.”1289 This level of transparency is of particular 
relevance in instances where there is a concern over the motivation behind the original offer. 

11.28  More definitive detail and practical examples on the boundaries of acceptability and non-
acceptability are also included. For example, the guidance makes clear the distinctions that 
exist “in a spectrum whereby one extreme can properly be considered to be a breach of the 
criminal law (The Bribery Act 2010) through to the low-level of hospitality which could in no 
way be considered as a breach of integrity on any party involved.”1290 Again, consultation in 
relation to this guidance has continued with “the concept of a public conscience test to such

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGmatters” said to be a further aspect informing the debate.1291 I deal with the third piece of 
guidance in relation to media relationships in more detail below.

11.29  HMIC’s third principal recommendation sought to ensure that sufficient regard was paid to 
the issues of integrity and anti-corruption in police training courses. In particular, and given 
the importance of leadership in securing high standards of integrity, it recommended that the 
Strategic Command Course and the High Potential Development Scheme should encompass 
these issues.1292 The ACPO response paper reported that “Chief Officers have taken steps to 
address this recommendation and have secured and delivered enhanced input on integrity 
and counter corruption to participants of the Strategic Command Course which concluded in 
March 2012 and also into the High Potential Development Scheme. This work will continue 
and  will  be  refined  in  future  courses  and  in  other  aspects  of  leadership  development  and 
training.”1293 Furthermore, it is reported that ACCAG will “commence the collation of data 
from across the service which will provide a refreshed analysis  of strategic threats to law 
enforcement from corruption.”1294 It is said that this work will assist chief officers in further 
improving governance around “risks to integrity” and will help to prevent and deter those 
engaged  in  corrupt  practices.  This  work  stream  will  also  further  inform  the  training  and 
briefing of police officers and police staff at all levels.1295 

11.30  Parenthetically on the issue of police training, I would endorse the Home Secretary’s view 
that  “confidence  and  competence  in  communicating  through  various  media  channels  are 
important at all levels – chief constable, borough commander and neighbourhood officer, for 
example. But so too is a clear understanding of how relationships with those who work in the 
media should be conducted in a professional, open and transparent way.”1296 On this issue, 
the Home Secretary reported that “the new police professional body will consider where there 
are gaps in existing training and how this should be built into police officer and staff learning 
and development.”1297 This certainly strikes me as an area of priority for the new body once 
instituted.

11.31  HMIC’s fourth substantive recommendation related to the promotion of improved corporate 
governance as a core part of everyday police business.1298 The ACPO response paper reports 
that “chief officer teams and heads of professional standards have conducted force reviews of 
their governance and oversight arrangements to ensure that those arrangements are fulfilling 
their function in helping promote the values of their force in the delivery of its objectives.”1299 
Following this exercise it was said to be evident that “chief officer teams need to be clear 
on their responsibility for ensuring Professional Standards Departments routinely scrutinise 
and provide governance over business interests, additional occupations, gifts and hospitality 
registers and oversight of procurement and contracts, and to ensure that this governance 
integrates with and promotes the values of the individual force and the wider service.”1300

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG11.32  ACPO also suggest that there is scope for individual forces and the Police Service more generally 
to  “obtain  increased  synergy  from  the  values  espoused  within  the  Statement  of  Common 
Purpose and the firmly embedded Standards of Professional Behaviour.”1301 The Statement 
of  Common  purpose  was  revised  in  July  2011  and  includes,  for  example,  the  aspirational 
principle that the police “will act with integrity, compassion, courtesy and patience, showing 
neither fear nor favour in what we do.”1302 Chief Officers are also encouraged to ensure that 
the “aspects of integrity examined and reported upon in Without Fear or Favour are subject to 
more regular scrutiny and oversight as matters affecting force reputation.”1303 In concluding, 
ACPO suggest that the “collective police service can best demonstrate its legitimacy, ethics 
and  values  by  being  seen  to  be  leading  by  example  by  instilling  regular  and  consistent 
governance and oversight of integrity and wider professional standards as part of the wider 
governance and as part of everyday business of the force.”1304 I would obviously agree with 
this assessment and it is a subject to which I will return in my concluding remarks. 

11.33  One matter raised through HMIC’s report in relation to which there is not yet a collectively 
agreed ACPO view is that of the “perception of the prospect of personal gain where senior 
leaders  (including  those  within  ACPO  and  at  other  levels  of  seniority)  retire  and  either 
immediately  or  shortly  thereafter  take  up  posts  with  commercial  companies  keen  to  take 
advantage  of  a  working  lifetime  of  experience  in  policing,  community  safety,  specialist 
investigations or ethical organisational leadership.”1305 ACPO suggest that further debate and 
analysis is needed to manage the question of public perception when “morally, ethically, and 
legally there are no barriers to prevent a retired officer from contributing to the wider policing 
framework as they see fit once free of obligations to public service.”1306 I deal substantively 
with this particular issue elsewhere.

Interim ACPO guidance for relationships with the media

11.34  This guidance is of particular relevance to the Inquiry given the detailed evidence that has 
been taken from a number of Chief Officers, other witnesses from within the Police Service, 
policing stakeholders and journalists relating to concerns over the police’s relationship with 
the media. The guidance itself was published in April 2012 following its approval by Chief 
Constables’ Council. Its described purpose is to “provide a framework for police officers and 
staff with an interim approach on the relationship of the police service with the media, in all 
its forms.”1307 Its interim status reflects the fact that it was anticipated that further changes to 
the document would be required as a result of this Inquiry. 

11.35  The person principally responsible for the production of this document was Chief Constable 
Andy Trotter, Chair of the ACPO Communications Advisory Group (CAG).1308 In describing the 
role of CAG, Mr Trotter said: “That is to bring together the heads of communications from the 
various police forces, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus others who come along as 
observers from time to time, to discuss recent best practice, discuss recent incidents, debrief

976

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGmatters, also to formulate policy, which we then circulate to forces around the country.”1309 
As Chair of CAG, Mr Trotter acts as the ACPO professional lead for media relations.1310 He 
explained that “as such I represent the views of the police service to media organisations and 
representative bodies such as the Society of Editors, Newspaper Society and National Union 
of Journalists. Accordingly from time to time I meet with editors and journalists to discuss any 
areas of current concern. I also liaise on media issues with other organisations who work with 
police forces such as the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and the Crown 
Prosecution Service (CPS).”1311 

11.36  The guidance itself is said to reinforce “a stance of maintaining open and transparent dealings 
with the media at all levels of the service for the benefit of the wider public interest”, provide 
“clarity for officers and staff on ensuring they speak on those aspects of policing for which 
they are specifically responsible”, and provide “additional clarity on the speaking terms (what 
constitutes on and off record and what is for publication) to prevent misunderstanding.”1312 
A clear expectation is also created that any police officer or member of police staff meeting 
in private with a journalist “must make a note of the meeting or disclosure which should be 
recorded in either a diary or pocket book.”1313 In addition, the guidance states that “where an 
officer or member of staff speaks to the media about a significant operational or organisational 
matter, a record of the conversation should be made (unless in a public forum, such as a public 
meeting or through the internet or a social media feed).”1314

11.37  A number of key principles underpin the guidance. Given their relevance I will reproduce 

them in full:1315

“Legitimacy is an essential aspect of the British policing model, based on consent. The 
press and other forms of media play an important part in assuring police legitimacy 
and protecting the public interest.

Police interaction with the media should be guided by a legitimate policing purpose, 
which  is  one  related  to  the  core  values  and  standards  of  policing,  set  out  in  the 
Statement of Mission and Values.

The relationship between police and media should be undertaken in a manner which 
lives up to the highest standards of impartiality and integrity.

The  police  service  has  a  duty  to  safeguard  the  confidentiality  and  integrity  of 
information, which must be balanced against the duty to be open and transparent 
wherever possible.”

11.38  It  is  clear  that  a  degree  of  confusion  has  existed  in  relation  to  the  terminology  used  by 
journalists to establish the basis for a conversation with police officers and police staff (see 
section 2 above). The guidance attempts to address this issue by providing a set of general 
definitions:1316

977

Chapter 3 | The Press and the Police: The Harm and the ResponseG“(a)  On the record – means that a journalist can report, quote and name their source. Where 
possible, all conversations should be on this basis and it should always be assumed that 
a conversation is on the record unless expressly agreed otherwise in advance.

(b)  Background/guidance – means that information provided can be reported without it 
being attributed to a source, whether named or not. This is sometimes used to provide 
further context around an on the record statement.

(c)  Off  the  record  –  means  that  use  of  information  provided  is  restricted  altogether. 
Occasionally  there may be a legitimate reason for an off the record conversation or 
briefing to take place, such as where news reporting may have an impact on a current 
investigation or as a means of preventing inaccuracies or misunderstanding.”

11.39  Given  that  the  terminology  is  sometimes  misunderstood  or  used  interchangeably,  the 
guidance emphasises the importance of clarifying “how they will apply before exchanging 
information.”1317  It  also  suggests  that  it  is  “good  practice”  where  possible  to  have  a  press 
officer present in circumstances where a police officer is “meeting or speaking with a journalist 
privately.”1318 This is obviously sensible advice. I deal with the distinct issue of ‘off the record’ 
conversations elsewhere within this Report (see section 2 above). 

11.40  In  relation  to  the  issue  of  integrity,  the  guidance  reminds  police  officers  and  police  staff 
that it is “essential to the standards of integrity demanded of the police service that police 
officers and staff should recognise and avoid or respond appropriately to potential conflicts 
of interest. These can be understood as situations where there may be competing obligations 
or interests to those which relate to the legitimate policing purpose for engaging with the 
media.”1319 Specifically in relation to the issue of potential conflicts, police officers and police 
staff are again reminded that any family or personal relationships with members of the media 
should be disclosed and recorded.1320 Perhaps most importantly, the guidance makes clear 
that police officers and police staff “have a clear duty to report to a line manager any corrupt 
practice or perception of corruption (e.g. offer of reward for information, any unacceptable 
level of hospitality, or seeking to engender an inappropriate relationship).1321 

11.41  In concluding, the guidance is clear that is does not provide the answers to every conceivable 
situation but rather it provides an approach and ethos to assist those within the Police Service 
to establish a productive and transparent relationship with the media. 

11.42  The Home Secretary welcomed the ACPO’s proposals and the continuing work taking place 
to  address  the  recommendations  contained  within  HMIC’s  report.1322  She  said  that  this 
continuing work will “need to focus on how the police, including senior leaders and those 
working in Professional Standards in particular, can play a proactive role in promoting and 
championing the new sets of guidance and monitoring compliance in order to bring about the 
real changes in attitudes and behaviours on integrity issues we are seeking.”1323 This is obviously 
a significant point. Transactional change in the form of new guidance and procedures, whilst 
important, can be rendered relatively meaningless if it is not also aligned with cultural change 
(in the form, for example, of a more transparent and challenging environment – particularly 
at ACPO level).

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG11.43  This leads me to an area of specific concern. I am confident that Police Professional Standards 
Departments, working within the framework of the newly developed guidance, will robustly 
ensure that those operating below Chief Officer level entirely comply with the policies and 
procedures in these areas, and will effectively tackle malpractice where necessary. However, 
I am less confident in their ability to challenge Chief Officers directly on integrity issues – in 
other words, albeit in a different context to that which I have usually used this phrase, who 
will be the guardian of these guardians? Neither is this a theoretical issue. It has not gone 
without notice that there have been a number of incidents of concern recently which may 
have called into question the robustness of the corporate governance arrangements in place 
within forces.1324

11.44  I entirely recognise that any recommendations that I make in this area may be temporary in 
nature. Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) are now in place, and nationally the Home 
Office  will  be  creating  a  police  professional  body  which  will  be  responsible  for  standards, 
skills and professionalism at all levels of policing. This new body will also play “a very active 
role in setting standards of ethics and integrity.”1325 That being said, I set out my views and 
recommendations as to the way forward in Part G Chapter 4 below.

1324 See for example the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Review Panel, the dismissal of the Chief Constable of 
Cleveland Police and the suspension of the Chief Constable of Cumbria Police

1.3 

Introduction
The  subject-matter  of  Module  Two  of  the  Inquiry  was  the  contacts  and  the  relationship 
between the press and the police, and the conduct of each. At the heart of this issue was the 
straightforward question (which is the same as will be discussed in respect of politicians): did 
the relationship become too close? In order to arrive at a fair and comprehensive picture, the 
Inquiry has examined many facets of that way in which press and police interact. It has done 
so by looking at the overlapping issues of ‘tip offs’, ‘taking media on operations’, ‘off-the-
record’ briefings, leaks, whistleblowing, gifts and hospitality, entertainment etc.

This list is lengthy but the issues underlying each of these areas have been similar. The words 
‘integrity’ and ‘perception’ are common refrains. Putting the matter at its lowest, if a police 
officer tips off a member of the press, the perception may well be that he or she has done so 
in exchange for past favours or in the expectation of some future benefit. At its highest, the 
issue becomes one of integrity for the police officer: his or her professional standing may be 
put under scrutiny. And the issue is exactly the same for off-the-record briefings and leaks 
(to cite just two of these foregoing examples), although separate points – in essence discrete 
matters of detail – arise in each individual case. 

Integrity lies at the heart of policing by consent, and it is damaging enough if there is even 
the perception that a police officer may not be discharging his or her duty with complete 
transparency and disinterest. Ultimately, problems of perception lie at the heart of the public 
concerns regarding the police investigation into phone hacking up to January 2011 and the 
commencement of Operation Weeting. The full history has been examined at length above,1 
and my conclusions need not be restated here; but what is inescapable is that the harm to 
the  reputation  of  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service  (MPS)  in  general  and  certain  individual 
police  officers  in  particular  has  been  immense.  I  have  already  referred  to  the  fact  that  a 
very damaging perception was created that the NoTW exercised an inappropriate degree of 
influence over the MPS, including a number of senior police officers and other employees. 
Public confidence is in the process of being restored by the work of the MPS since January 
2011 and, I hope, the transparent process of this Inquiry. 

1.4 

I mention the MPS specifically in the context of the investigation into phone hacking, but I 
am able to go further. The problems in the relationship between the police and the press 
covered by the evidence adduced during the course of Module Two of the Inquiry almost 
exclusively related to the MPS; save for isolated examples, typically arising when an event of 
national newsworthiness arose in the regions, the 43 police forces2 outside the metropolis 
enjoy sound relationships with the press, and the conduct of each gives rise to no concern.  
I will touch on possible explanations for this later.

1 Part E Chapter 4
2 I take the figure of 44 as the total number of police forces in England and Wales. I do not intend to exclude Scotland 
and Northern Ireland from my general observations on this issue, although I recognise that the Inquiry received much 
less evidence about them

I will examine each of the issues I have identified above in turn, and set out my conclusions 
and  recommendations  under  separate  headings,  but  at  this  stage  I  dwell  on  common  or 
generic matters. There are a number of interrelated considerations which need to be set out. 
First, the scale of the problem needs to be kept in proportion. The Inquiry has not unearthed 
extensive evidence of police corruption (noting, as it has done, the current position in relation 
to Operation Elveden which is concerned with payments to public officials generally); nor is 
there evidence satisfying the standard of proof I am applying to findings of fact in this Inquiry, 
namely the balance of probabilities, that significant numbers of police officers lack integrity 
in one or more of the respects I have examined earlier.3 Speculation, suspicion and legitimate 
perceptions may abound, and troubling evidence has been identified in a limited number of 
cases, but the notion that this may be a widespread problem as a matter of fact is not borne 
out. 

Having  made that important point, I recognise  that breaches of  professional  standards  of 
the  nature  under  consideration  are  extremely  difficult  to  prove.  Journalists  protect  their 
confidential sources, particularly if a briefing is off-the-record; tip offs may be suspected (in 
some  cases,  going  so  far  as  to  generate  a  reasonable  inference)  but  clear-cut  evidence  is 
usually lacking. Further, the difficulties inherent in conducting an effective leak inquiry are 
legion. These are all factors which I need to continue to bear in mind when examining the 
issue on a generic rather than a case-specific basis, and I do not overlook the fact that the 
Terms  of  Reference  require  me  to  approach  my  responsibilities,  so  far  as  is  possible,  at  a 
reasonably high level of generality.

Another  highly  relevant  consideration  is  the  need  to  find  the  right  balance  between 
relationships that are overly close and those which are non-existent. The importance of the 
free-flow of information (that is to say, appropriate information) between the police and the 
press cannot be overstated. The press have an important role in holding the police to account, 
and this entails building up relationships of trust with police officers thereby allowing the free 
exchange of information within relevant guidelines. Further, the whole concept of policing 
by consent requires the engagement of the public, and very often this will be best achieved 
through the mediation of the press. 

There are many respects in which off-the-record briefings operate against the public interest, 
but in some, the public interest will be well served. By way of example, trusted journalists will 
benefit from a ‘background’ briefing which enables reporting on specific topics to be placed 
in  their  proper  context;  the  press  may  be  warned  off  pursuing  certain  lines  of  inquiry  or 
publishing a story on a particular occasion through concern that a police investigation may be 
prejudiced. Further, albeit in a different context, although generally speaking drinking alcohol 
in a professional context amounts to poor judgment, and should not happen, there may well 
be occasions, admittedly relatively rare, on which it is unobjectionable. The point I am making 
is a short and simple one; I am addressing the need to find the right balance, the mid-course 
between policies and practices which are overly prescriptive one way or the other. 

In many cases the straightforward application of common sense will be a sufficient guide: 
the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset, Colin Port, referred to this as ‘the blush test’. 
Yet, although that may work perfectly well for the vast majority of police officers working 
hard  and  conscientiously  in  the  public  interest,  some  may  blush  less  readily  than  others. 
Furthermore, there remains a need for written policy guidance which is clear and directive, 
and caters for the majority of situations. One issue which the Inquiry has focused on is the 
variability of such guidance across the Police Service as a whole. There is a need for greater 

3 Part G Chapter 3

both Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and the Association of Chief Police 
Officers (ACPO) are addressing this issue, but further work needs to be done.

1.10  Another factor which I bear in mind, and this harks back to what I said about the MPS, is that 
senior police officers working in London are expected to have a public face: they speak for 
the organisation as a whole in the public domain, often on issues of huge importance and 
concern, and in so doing will necessarily engage with the press. I do not overlook the fact 
that  Chief  Constables  will  also  need  to  form  professional  relationships  with  their  regional 
titles, but the pressures and expectations are not quite the same. Furthermore, there has 
been an understandable tendency for senior police officers operating in London – those at 
the rank of Assistant Commissioner and above – legitimately to regard themselves as akin 
to  political  figures  in  the  sense  that  the  nature  of  their  work  can  regularly  place  them  in 
the public eye. As I have already pointed out, a number of Commissioners of the MPS have 
deliberately courted professional relationships with the press, amongst other reasons, in an 
effort to enhance the standing of the service in the minds of the public. But the distinction 
between endeavouring to improve the standing of the Service on the one hand, and working 
in the pursuit of self-interest on the other, may be a fine one.

1.11  The  Police  Service  is  also  a  hierarchical  organisation  with  clear  command  structures  and 
delineations  of  authority.  This  has  at  least  two  consequences.  First  and  foremost,  junior 
officers will look up to their seniors for professional and ethical guidance; not necessarily 
by expressly seeking advice, but rather for the example they might set. If a highly ranked 
officer is known to be wined and dined in expensive restaurants by representatives of the 
press, that has the potential to set the standard for those underneath him or her. Leading 
from the front carries with it both its privileges and its responsibilities. Secondly, and even 
more problematically, the chain of command makes it difficult for junior officers to report 
their  seniors  for  breaches  of  professional  standards,  and  at  the  very  least  there  will  be  a 
perception that those in command of the Professional Standards Divisions (PSDs) of police 
forces may naturally be disinclined to approach concerns drawn to their attention regarding 
officers of a higher rank, if only because of the natural assumption that senior officers know 
what they are doing and doubtless can fully justify what, in a more junior officer, might be 
open to challenge. All this is human nature, and to that extent completely understandable; 
and pragmatic solutions need to be devised to address potentially intractable problems of 
this nature.

1.12  Another factor I bear in mind is the risk of over-reaction. Lord Condon, a former Commissioner 
of the MPS, spoke of twenty year cycles, being something akin to “scandal, inquiry, remedial 
action, relaxation, complacency, scandal, inquiry.”4 What he did not state expressly is that 
the ‘remedial action’ has the potential of going too far in the direction of disengagement or, 
speaking more colloquially, battening down the hatches. Again, this is no more and no less 
than human nature, but one needs to identify the potential risk in order to guard against it.

1.13  Before  turning  to  examine  the  specific  matters  which  were  addressed  above,5  I  need  to 
put all of this into perspective by drawing attention to one answer Neil Wallis gave when 
pressed by Counsel to the Inquiry about his relationship with Lord Stevens when the latter 
was Commissioner of the MPS:6

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG‘A. This is really difficult, because I just find it – John Stevens is an officer who worked for 
40-odd years in the police. He lived his life, 20 years, as a target for IRA assassination 
as he carried out the Stevens 3 Inquiries. He was the man who was the gangbuster in 
Northumbria. He came down here. He bust corruption in the Met. So the suggestion is 
that this man of integrity, of experience, of immense crime-fighting ability, is going to 
be seduced by me taking him down to Cecconi’s and having steak and chips and a nice 
bottle of wine? I just can’t begin to see where this comes from. All I’m saying is: have 
you ever had a working lunch? Have you ever had a working lunch with somebody 
more than once? Have you ever had a drink at that working lunch? You may well have 
not. I guarantee everybody in this room just about has and it is the way of the world. 
That is all I’m saying. I’m not suggesting – I certainly won’t accept the idea that me 
going for dinner with a police officer is any different from a civil servant going for 
dinner with a businessman. I see no difference in it at all. I might be wrong, but –
LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: I’m not sure you are wrong.
A. I’m certain I’m not.’

1.14  For  ease  of  reference  and  understanding,  I  will  set  out  my  conclusions,  and  then  my 
recommendations, in relation to the specific matters covered above.7 Often, I will draw on 
my earlier analysis, expanding it only where I need to place my conclusions into context. I 
should record that I have had regard to the detailed and helpful closing submissions lodged 
by  the  Core  Participants  in  relation  to  Module  Two  (as  with  the  other  modules):  save  in 
isolated instances, I do not refer to these expressly, but they have aided the development of 
my thinking on these matters.

2.	 Tip	offs
2.1 

By  way  of  overview,  the  evidence  that  the  Inquiry  received  on  this  issue  could  fairly  be 
described as ‘light’ in relation to specific incidents (ie it would rarely discharge the standard 
of proof I am applying to findings of fact), but it is reasonably compelling at a higher level of 
generality. Looking at the bigger picture, a critical mass of convergent evidence begins to be 
persuasive. Furthermore, putting the jigsaw together, rather more general inferences may 
be drawn; these cannot always be explained away by coincidence or invoking some other 
explanation.

2.2 

Tip offs are but one aspect of the wider problem of leaks. I have made the point, both in this 
context and elsewhere, that the more robust the systems and processes in place to mitigate 
the risks of leaks from within an organisation the better. I have also said8 that it is sensible to 
go one stage further. It should be a matter of serious professional concern to the police that 
information about their activities which should be kept confidential remains so. The presence 
of  the  press  at  a  high  profile  arrest  may  provide  positive  coverage  although,  unless  very 
carefully handled, it may also give rise to difficult issues of fairness within the criminal justice 
process. Obviously, if for good reason, a decision has been taken to brief the press about a 
forthcoming arrest and to allow representative attendance, the risks (and the responsibilities 
to the target of an arrest) should have been calibrated and taken into account. If there is no 
such authority, however, and there is a legitimate inference that someone (whether police 
officer or civilian employee of the police) has leaked the information to the press generally or 
a journalist specifically, I do not take the view that this is ‘just one of those things’. It should 
not have happened.

3.2 

3.3 

The professionalism required of police officers must be sufficiently robust to instil the mindset 
that such leaks about forthcoming arrests or the involvement of the famous in the criminal 
justice system are not in the public interest, and that the provision of appropriate briefing as 
to police activity should only be handled through open and transparent procedures which 
have taken account of all relevant circumstances: they should not be by the back door. 

I do not have any individual recommendations to make which are specific to the issue of tip 
offs, as opposed to the related issue of leaks. However, police forces should bear in mind 
what I have said about the importance of adherence to professional obligations and the need 
for these decisions to be made in a formal and transparent manner, not clandestinely still less 
involving self-interest.

Involvement	of	the	press	on	operations
Here, there are none of the evidential issues I have mentioned in the context of tip offs, in 
the sense that the fact of a press presence at an arrest or similar operation will be obvious. 
Nor do I have a sense that such problems that have existed in the past give rise to special 
concern. Nonetheless, I do recognise that there are issues which could arise of privacy under 
Article 8 and fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), 
particularly in the sort of high-profile case which may be of the most interest to the press. 
There are also issues of perception and favouritism, although the evidence I have heard falls 
short of suggesting anything close to an exchange of favours.

I have already pointed out that there is existing ACPO Guidance9 and formal MPS policy10 on 
this issue. The question arises as to whether these documents are sufficient to assuage public 
concerns in this respect. As I have made clear above,11 I detected in much of the reflective 
evidence  I  heard  on  this  issue  a  sense  that  there  needs  to  be  a  further  tightening  of  the 
current approach.

Overall I would endorse the general views of the Commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, and 
Chief Constable Andrew Trotter, of the British Transport Police, on this issue. Police forces 
must weigh very carefully the public interest considerations of taking the media on police 
operations against the rights of the individuals who are the subject of such an operation. 
Forces must also have directly in mind a consideration of any potential and consequential 
impact  on  the  victims  in  such  cases.  More  generally,  I  think  that  the  current  guidance  in 
this area needs to be strengthened. For example, I think that it should be made abundantly 
clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there 
may be an immediate risk to the public), the names or identifying details of those who are 
arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or the public: these 
details are not routinely announced by way of press release; that the press were present at 
the arrest should make no difference.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG4.	 Off-the-record	briefings
4.1 

It has already been noted that this terminology generates a degree of confusion, which in 
itself has the capability to undermine adherence to professional standards. Given the room 
for debate about the meaning of this term and others describing the status to be accorded 
to information supplied by police officers, it is unsurprising that the current ‘Interim ACPO 
Guidance for Relationships with the Media’ seeks to define the widely deployed terminology 
expressly:12

“On the record – means that a journalist can report, quote and name their source. 
Where  possible,  all  conversations  should  be  on  this  basis  and  it  should  always  be 
assumed that a conversation is on the record unless expressly agreed otherwise in 
advance.

Background/guidance – means that information provided can be reported without 
it  being  attributed  to  a  source,  whether  named  or  not.  This  is  sometimes  used  to 
provide further context around an on the record statement.

Off-the-record  –  means  that  use  of  information  provided  is  restricted  altogether. 
Occasionally there may be a legitimate reason for an off-the-record conversation or 
briefing to take place, such as where news reporting may have an impact on a current 
investigation or as a means of preventing inaccuracies or misunderstanding.” 

4.2 

I have already recognised that the use of off-the-record briefings, properly understood, may 
be a valuable resource in the context of an established, trusting relationship between a police 
officer and a journalist. Without seeking to revisit the terminological debate, background/
guidance  briefings  are  also  capable  of  working  in  the  public  interest,  as  opposed  to  the 
private interests of the police officer or the journalist. On the other hand, risks clearly exist 
and these are of a similar nature to those already highlighted in Sections 2 and 3 above: the 
potential for confidential information to be disseminated and then published; the perception 
that inappropriate relationships will be created and favours exchanged. 

4.3 

I  have  already  pointed  out  that  Elizabeth  Filkin  in  her  report  into  the  ethics  of  the  press 
and police relationship, agreed that there was value for the Police Service in the limited and 
responsible use of ‘off-the-record’ communications. She was specific about this:13 

“…I have no doubt that the police will have to occasionally do off-the-record briefing, 
because otherwise they would jeopardise an investigation, and a reporter may have 
got a bit of a story which, if they ran it, would be very harmful, and the only way to 
prevent that being run, in a sensible fashion, would be to give them an off-the-record 
briefing and to tell them that you would inform them as soon as you could when it 
was possible to let that get out onto the public airwaves.” 

4.4 

I certainly agree that, in the circumstances outlined above, and for example in the context 
of counter-terrorism operations or other sensitive police investigations, some form of non-
reportable or confidential briefing mechanism should continue to be available as a limited 
tool for the Police Service in their interaction with the media. I am not sure that any more 
specific guidance from me in this area is necessary or would be helpful.

Chapter 4 | The Press and the Police: Conclusions and RecommendationsG4.5 

However, I would make the following observations. Given the confusion that clearly exists 
between journalists and police officers and police staff alike in relation to the term off-the-
record, I believe that serious consideration should be given to its removal from the lexicon of 
police and media contact. Aside from the confusion in actual meaning, a negative connotation 
has also developed which implies that any exchange of information through ‘off-the-record’ 
contact  is  being  done  on  a  surreptitious  basis.  In  my  view,  greater  clarity  of  thought  and 
consistency of application would be achieved if two descriptors were used. What is critical is 
that there should be no doubt about the status of all that passes from the officer to the press.

I	recommend	that	the	term	‘off-the-record’	briefing	should	be	discontinued.	The	
term	 ‘non-reportable	 briefing’	 should	 be	 used	 to	 cover	 a	 background	 briefing	
which	is	not	to	be	reported,	and	the	term	‘embargoed	briefing’	should	be	used	to	
cover	a	situation	where	the	content	of	the	briefing	may	be	reported	but	not	until	
a	specified	event	or	time.14 In	my	judgment,	these	terms	more	neutrally	describe	
what	are	legitimate	police	and	media	interactions.	

4.6 

In their written submissions at the conclusion of Module Two, the MPS set out its position as 
follows:15

‘The current thinking of the MPS is that there should be a requirement that a record 
be made of every contact between an MPS officer and a journalist. The purpose of 
that requirement would be to make it possible to ascertain, if the need ever arises, 
the nature and frequency of the contact, the level of contact and reason for contact. 
This, it is anticipated, would serve both as an incentive for personal discipline and a 
means for discovering and discouraging the unauthorised release of information.

The guiding principle for the future regulation of contact with the media should be 
one of openness, allowing the Police Service to engage constructively with the media 
whilst ensuring that it can be held to account for its relationship with its media’

4.7 

I welcome and endorse almost the whole of this contribution, save for the qualification that 
I would distinguish between a requirement and good practice in relation to the recording of 
contact between junior officers and journalists. I would also endorse the comments both of 
Roger Baker,16 Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary, and Mrs Filkin in relation to the need 
for transparency in this area. If the police are simply seeking to correct an inaccuracy within a 
story, for example, then I can see no legitimate reason why that contact should not normally 
be considered to be ‘on-the-record’ (there may be rare occasions when the correction needs 
to be ‘off-the-record’ to avoid identifying an individual suspect). 

4.8  More  generally,  although  I  would  also  encourage  junior  officers  and  staff  to  do  the  same 

(principally for their own protection),

14 Briefings may be a combination of the two: for example, part embargoed (i.e. reportable later) and part non-
reportable (ie background only, and never to be reported). Equally, a briefing may be in part on the record and, in part, 
embargoed or non-reportable.

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipGI	recommend	that	it	should	be	mandatory	for	ACPO	rank	officers	to	record	all	of	
their	 contact	 with	 the	 media,	 and	 for	 that	 record	 to	 be	 available	 publically	 for	
transparency	and	audit	purposes.	This	record	need	be	no	more	than	a	very	brief	
note	to	the	effect	that	a	conversation	has	taken	place	and	the	subject	matter	of

retained.	Finally,	in	circumstances	where	policy	or	organisation	matters	may	be	on	
the	agenda	for	discussion,	it	is	good	practice	for	a	press	officer	also	to	be	present.	

4.9 

Given the important role that the press play in assuring police legitimacy and in protecting 
the public interest I certainly do not want to discourage contact between the police (at all 
levels) and the media. It also remains important that the appropriate degree of contact is 
maintained between the press and junior officers. Subject to what I have already said, the 
latter  should  be  trusted  to  use  their  judgment  to  do  what  is  right  and  not  to  do  what  is 
wrong, and be accountable for the consequences. However, where there is an incident of 
unauthorised disclosure, the lack of any record may in itself be a determining factor when 
assessing  the  propriety  of  what  has  happened  in  the  context  of  an  internal  police  leak 
investigation (assuming that there is other probative evidence which links the police officer 
to the leak). 

4.10  Finally, and most importantly in my view, police officers at all levels must only communicate 

with the media within their own area of competence. I would entirely endorse and, thus, 

I	recommend	as	good	practice	the	simple	rule	included	within	the	‘Interim	ACPO	
Guidance	for	Relationships	with	the	Media’	which	is:17

“Police  officers  and  staff  should  ask:  ‘am  I  the  person  responsible  for 
communicating about this issue and is there a policing purpose for doing so?’ If 
the answer to both parts of this question is ‘yes’, they should go ahead.”

5.	 Leaks	of	information
5.1 

This  issue  shares  many  themes  in  common  with  the  previous  topics  –  in  particular,  the 
disclosure of unauthorised, if not confidential, information to the press – but there is often an 
added dimension, namely a less than selfless motive. Leaks may take place because a police 
officer genuinely believes that this may be the best way of placing misconduct or impropriety 
into the public domain, but sometimes the motive is little other than personal disgruntlement 
or the desire to wound colleagues. Putting to one side the instances where such motives are 
in play, the issue of leaks clearly overlaps with the issue of whistleblowing which I address in 
Section 8 below, but at this stage I am looking at the matter more broadly.

5.2 

5.3 

I fully accept and understand that the issue is much more nuanced than the foregoing short 
summary conveys, and I invite attention to my detailed examination of this topic above.18

As  with  ‘tip-offs’,  there  are  serious  evidential  issues.  Leaks  are  notoriously  difficult  to 
investigate, and often a suspected leak turns out to be something different: the press may 
have obtained relevant information from some other source, or may simply have indulged

5.6 

successfully  in  an  exercise  in  speculation.  More  specifically,  Mr  Baker  suggested  that  leak 
investigations can be made more difficult “by the fact that there is a sloppiness of rules around 
what is permissible and what isn’t…”.19 HMIC, through its report ‘Without fear or favour – a 
review of police relationship, also stressed the need for national standards in this area.20 I 
would fully endorse that recommendation and I have dealt with the ongoing response of 
Police Service fully above.21

In Section 4 above, I have recommended that it should be mandatory for ACPO rank officers 
to record all of their contact with the media, and good practice for junior officers and staff 
(for their own protection). I entirely accept that this in itself will not prevent a determined 
individual from leaking. However, as Commissioner Hogan-Howe pointed out,22 a record of 
that individual’s account would be a starting place for an investigation. 

A degree of lack of transparency in this area is inevitable given the often understandable 
desire of the media to protect the identity of their sources. Given the reputational damage 
that  can  be  caused,  I  can  also  readily  understand  the  frustration  of  the  Police  Service  in 
circumstances where a ‘police source’ is quoted but it then transpires that the information 
came from an outside individual. There is a balance here and, although I recognise the critical 
importance of protecting sources, I would certainly encourage the press to be as transparent 
as possible when using the term ‘source’, so that, where possible, the general provenance of 
the information is more easily understood: furthermore, to assert that there is a source when, 
in truth, there is not, both potentially damages the police and is, in any event, misleading on 
the part of the journalist.

I turn to  address the related issue  of  misuse  of  the Police  National  Computer (PNC). This 
was of particular concern to the Core Participant Victims and I am grateful for their written 
submissions  on  this  topic.  Overall,  notwithstanding  the  problems  that  there  have  been,  I 
am satisfied that the MPS and the wider Police Service now treat this issue with sufficient 
seriousness. However, it is equally clear that there can be no room for complacency in this 
area given that misuse of the PNC continues to be a problem for the service as a whole. With 
this in mind,

I	recommend	that	the	Police	Service	should	re-examine	the	rigour	of	the	auditing	
process	 and	 the	 frequency	 of	 the	 conduct	 of	 audits	 in	 relation	 to	 access	 to	 the	
Police	 National	 Computer	 (PNC).	 Additional	 consideration	 should	 also	 be	 given	
to	the	number	of	people	given	access	to	the	PNC	and	the	associated	rules	which	
govern	its	usage.

6.	 Gifts,	hospitality	and	entertainment
6.1 

These topics can be addressed under the same heading, although the issue of entertainment in 
particular has attracted significant public interest and concern. In many ways it is emblematic 
of the issues of perception which surround, if not encase, the relationship between the MPS 
and News International (NI) and the history of the investigation of phone hacking between

done nothing to enhance the reputation of the MPS in the public mind.

6.2 

6.3 

6.4 

Apart  from  the  evidence  bearing  directly  on  the  relationship  between  the  MPS  and  NI, 
which it is not necessary to recapitulate at this stage, the Inquiry heard of a wide range of 
approaches  and  house  styles.  Much  of  the  variability  is  no  doubt  attributable  to  differing 
personalities and temperaments, but as Mrs Filkin has concluded more generally, “[t]here has 
been wide variation in how the senior team interpreted policy on dealing with the media and 
receiving gifts and hospitality. In some instances this interpretation is seen as inappropriate. 
There has been no clear standard set by the senior team for police officers and staff to use as 
a guide for their own behaviour and in some instances the standards set have been poor and 
have led to consequent damage.”23 Mrs Filkin recommended that the MPS senior team “must 
signal a change in culture and set a consistent example for all staff on the ethical standards 
they expect, including how they relate to the media and the interpretation of the gifts and 
hospitality register.”24 I would certainly endorse this finding. 

The recent ACPO Guidance25 sets out the circumstances in which hospitality may, or may not, 
be accepted. I have set this out in full elsewhere.26

I have made it clear that I would certainly endorse the key principles contained within this 
guidance.  Without  wanting  to  be  overly  prescriptive  or  puritanical  on  this  issue,  in  the 
circumstances

I	recommend	that	the	recent	ACPO	Guidance	should	more	specifically	spell	out	the	
dangers	of	consuming	alcohol	in	a	setting	of	casual	hospitality	(without	necessarily	
specifying	a	blanket	ban).

It also strikes me that the concept of an “industry norm” in this context may still allow for a 
variance in practice from force to force, and may tend to assume what needs to be established. 
However, I would certainly adopt in full the guidance provided to police officers (at all levels) 
and police staff in helping them to determine the boundaries of what is acceptable: 

“Is it genuine? Is the offer made for reasons of genuine appreciation for something 
I  have  done?  Why  is  the  offer  being  made?  What  are  the  circumstances?  Have  I 
solicited this offer in any way or does the donor feel obliged to make this offer?
Is it independent? Would the offer or acceptance be seen as reasonable in the eyes of 
the public? Would a reasonable bystander be confident I could remain impartial and 
independent in all of the circumstances?
Is  it  free?  Will  I  feel  obliged  to  do  something  in  return?  How  do  I  feel  about  the 
propriety of the offer? What are the donor’s expectations of me should I accept?
Is it transparent? Would I be comfortable if my acceptance of this offer was transparent 
to colleagues, the force, and the public or if it was reported publicly? What could be 
the outcome for the force if this offer was accepted or declined.”27 

6.5 

It is also vital that transactional change in the form of new policies and guidance is aligned 
with  real  cultural  change.  As  the  evidence  has  made  clear,  leadership  can  be  the  key 
determining factor in this regard. Given this, it is important that a challenging and transparent

rank, understand what is expected of them in terms of issues of integrity. 

7.	 Media	employment
7.1 

I  have  examined  this  topic  from  two  opposing  perspectives:  first,  from  the  viewpoint  of 
journalists being recruited to work for the police service; and second, the other way round. 
Unsurprisingly, the second issue is far more sensitive and problematic than the first. 

7.2 

7.3 

7.4 

In brief, I do not believe that there should be any restriction on journalists being recruited 
to work for the Police Service, save that the process should be conducted in line with the 
procedures of the Government Communication Network (GCN) in an open and transparent 
manner. It may in fact be good practice, for the purposes of transparency, for individual forces 
to publish details of the make-up of their PR or communications departments in generic terms, 
but I consider that to be a matter for them. There is clearly a need for media expertise and 
the Police Service should be free to choose the best person for the job in a competitive free 
market. That is not to say – as a freestanding observation - that forces should not examine 
their existing media relations training and awareness with a view to increasing skill levels, in 
relation to which Surrey Police have derived much benefit.28

The issue of police officers leaving to work for the media is, I have already said, more difficult. 
That issue may be sub-divided into two segments. Taking first the position of junior officers, 
I have concluded that it would be wrong to place restrictions, for example in the form of a 
‘cooling off’ period, on police officers and staff below ACPO rank leaving the Police Service, 
perhaps to return to a career in the media. In practice, the evidence suggests that journalists 
leaving the police service for an employed job rarely return to journalism. In addition, any 
restrictions  would  clearly  have  to  be  balanced  against  the  right  of  any  individual  to  seek 
employment as and where he or she wishes. In these circumstances, I believe that it would 
be contrary to the public interest to impose any restrictions of the type described. 

The  position  is  different  as  regards  senior  officers  of  ACPO  rank.  The  Inquiry  received  a 
considerable body of evidence which reflected public concern of very senior officers taking 
media  jobs  (usually  on  retirement),  or  writing  articles  for  the  press;  I  do  not  touch  the 
question of books or memoires. This issue is intertwined in the public mind with the broader 
perceptual questions surrounding the relationship between senior officers of the MPS and 
NI, a topic which I have covered fully elsewhere.29

7.5  Whilst  mindful  of  the  concerns  expressed  by  a  number  of  witnesses,  including  Sir  Paul 
Stephenson, the former Commissioner of the MPS, and Chief Constable Stephen House, of 
Strathclyde Police, in particular, on balance I have come to the conclusion that consideration 
should be given to the terms on which ACPO rank officers are engaged and, in particular to 
whether these terms should be amended to prevent employment by media organisations 
in  much  the  same  way  as  the  previous  Metropolitan  Police  Authority  (MPA)  contracts 
prevented employment by those with a contractual relationship with the MPS. I appreciate 
that regard must be had to issues of restraint of trade, to the right to seek employment, 
to freedom of expression, and, additionally, to the public interest in receiving information. 
But there are counterbalancing public interests that are also important. With this in mind, it 
seems to me that a time bar of twelve months would be sufficient to provide an appropriate

employment by the media.

7.6 

I am not in a position to consider all the ramifications of such a proposal; my recommendation 
is, therefore, limited. In the circumstances,

I	recommend	that	consideration	should	be	given	to	the	terms	upon	which	ACPO	
rank	officers	are	appointed	and,	in	particular,	whether	these	terms	should	include	
some	limitation	upon	the	nature	of	any	employment	within	or	by	the	media	that	
can	be	undertaken	without	the	approval	of	the	relevant	authority	for	a	period	of	12	
months	following	the	cessation	of	the	appointment.

I understand that should this recommendation be accepted then it may also require a change 
in the regulations governing the Police Service.

8.	 Corruption,	whistleblowing	and	related	matters
8.1 

I appreciate that the topics of whistleblowing and corruption raise issues which are common 
to  neither,  but  for  the  purposes  of  this  Inquiry  there  is  much  common  ground.  It  is  for 
that reason that I take them together. Doing so also makes it easier to follow the series of 
recommendations which I set out below.

8.2 

8.3 

I take corruption first. The Inquiry has not been the place to examine the broader issue of 
corruption within the Police Service; the focus has rightly been on corruption in the specific 
context of media relations. Additionally, the current position in relation to Operation Elveden 
has  inevitably  hampered  the  ability  of  the  Inquiry  to  delve  into  the  issue  in  any  depth. 
Nonetheless, I bear in mind the frank evidence I have heard from senior police officers which 
has given me a clear sense of the seriousness and scale of the problem. No one underestimates 
the gravity of the issue as a matter of generality, but it would be wrong for anyone to believe 
that corruption is endemic in the Police Service.

As I have already pointed out, training and guidance are obviously important preventive tools 
in seeking to address this issue. The relevant overarching guidance in this area is provided, 
first, through the ACPO Counter Corruption Advisory Group (ACCAG), whose ‘Guidance for 
the Investigation of Corruption’ was first published in 2003 and last formally revised in 2006; 
this guidance has been adopted by all chief officers.30 Second, the recognised ‘Standards of 
Professional Behaviour’ are set out in the Schedule to the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008 
and the related Home Office guidance (026/2008) on police unsatisfactory performance and 
misconduct procedures, and Standards of Professional Behaviour for Police staff, as agreed 
by the Police Staff Council. This guidance has also been adopted by all police forces, including 
the MPS.31 Both sets of guidance are currently under review and are dealt with in more detail 
elsewhere.32

8.4 

Evidenced by the guidance and training currently in place, and the vigour with which individual 
police officers and police staff are pursued where criminality is identified, it is clear that the

32 Part G Chapter 3

Chapter 4 | The Press and the Police: Conclusions and RecommendationsGPolice  Service  takes  this  issue  seriously.  There  are,  however,  gaps  and  weaknesses  in  the 
collective approach to the issue a number of which have been identified by HMIC. Having said 
that, I am in no doubt that the Police Service is genuine in its desire to tackle corruption head 
on, with the ACPO led response to the HMIC report being particularly important in this regard. 
For my part, I would whole heartedly adopt the HMIC recommendations relating to the need 
for consistent national standards and guidance, enhanced training and awareness, and more 
robust corporate governance arrangements. From the stand-point of sanctions, corruption is 
a criminal offence with serious penalties, I do not feel it necessary therefore, to recommend 
any additional statutory or regulatory tools to assist in dealing with this important issue.

8.5 

The Home Secretary, the Rt Hon Theresa May, confirmed this last point and provided the 
Inquiry with her summary of the key findings. She said:33

“I  think  the  key  findings  that  come  out  of  this  in  many  ways  chime  in  with  those 
previous work that’s been done, particularly by the HMIC, about the need for greater 
clarity both for the public in terms of what’s police corruption and therefore what 
is  appropriate  to  bring  to  the  IPCC,  but  also  greater  clarity  in  terms  of  –  perhaps 
greater consistency in recording incidents that have taken place from force to force. 
They  identify  that  different  forces  appear  to  have…different  levels  of  reporting  of 
complaints about corruption and the question is raised as to whether that’s because 
of a different definition being used rather than the behaviour in relation to the forces. 
Crucially, it refers again to the issue of additional powers and also about resources, 
and these are issues that we intend, when legislative time allows, to be able to make 
changes to the powers to the IPCC and we are looking at the case that they’ve put 
forward in relation to additional resources.” 

8.6 

8.7 

8.8 

I certainly support these proposed changes and share the view of the IPCC that, in order for 
the system to work as it should, it is vital that all police forces are both alert to allegations 
of  corruption  and  are  capable  of  dealing  with  them  effectively  and  appropriately.34  I  also 
agree  that  this  is  an  area  where  independent  oversight  is  essential,  particularly  from  the 
standpoint of public perception, not least because the confidence of the public in the police is 
fundamental to its legitimacy and to the absolutely critical cooperation and compliance that, 
as an organisation, it needs both to expect and also to achieve.

The issue of corruption overlaps with that of whistleblowing for the obvious reason that the 
latter is often the route to the former being exposed. I recognise that there are other routes, 
including of course robust investigative journalism (undeniably in the public interest) as well 
as the persistent endeavours of leaders within the Police Service, but for present purposes I 
am focusing on disclosures from within the organisation.

I  recognise  and  understand  the  sensitivity  of  this  issue,  and  the  sentiment  expressed  by 
many that the press is a safety valve for genuine grievances and concerns within the Police 
Service as a whole. However, there remains an important point of principle which I need to 
come back to: that information which is confidential should remain so, unless there really are 
exceptional circumstances justifying the placing of that information into the public domain. 
Additionally, and looking at this more widely, the ends do not usually or, at least necessarily, 
justify the means.

992

PART G | The Press and the Police: the RelationshipG8.9  My overall assessment is that a series of pragmatic solutions need to be devised to maximise 
the chance that genuine whistle-blowers will use confidential avenues in which they may have 
faith, rather than feel it necessary to break confidences by bringing about much wider public 
dissemination through disclosures to the media. In my view, this strikes the right balance 
between the competing interests at stake.

8.10  As I have already said, the starting point for any police officer or member of police staff wishing 
to report an issue of concern should be that they first look to their internal procedures, which 
are buttressed by the law governing protected disclosures. I appreciate that all police forces 
already have a whistleblowing line of reporting direct to the PSD of that force: typically, this 
will be headed by a detective chief superintendent – in other words, a senior officer capable 
of holding the respect of the majority of police ranks. Nonetheless, I also recognise that Mrs 
Filkin identified a general lack of confidence in the ability of these departments to address 
their concerns across the board. There may also be some legitimate concern as to the ability (if 
not the overall willingness) of PSDs challenging the most senior on issues concerning integrity

8.11  Apart  from  the  PSDs,  the  present  position  is  that  the  Independent  Police  Complaints 
Commission  (IPCC)  already  has  a  Public  Interest  Disclosure  Act  telephone  line  which  is 
available for use in these circumstances, but it does not enjoy a sufficiently high profile. As 
and when whistle blowers use it, I understand that the IPCC’s practice, if at all possible, is to 
conduct an interview, in order better to inform its assessment of the merits of the concern 
being expressed.

8.12  Given  the  apparent  lack  of  trust  in  the  current  process,  a  more  independently  operated 
system should be considered. I strongly believe that a more developed structure is required to 
ensure that the public have absolute confidence that issues of integrity will be appropriately 
addressed  at  all  levels  within  the  Police  Service,  and  that  whistle  blowers  also  have  the 
confidence that their grievances will be addressed.

8.13  As I explain below, I have in mind an enhanced role for both the IPCC and HMIC. For a number 
of reasons I am not in a position to descend into the detail of the structure I have in mind not 
least because of the changing landscape surrounding police policy and its implementation. I 
am simply not in a position to forecast precisely how the responsibilities of the newly elected 
Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) will fit into the overall picture alongside the work 
of the newly created National Crime Agency, ACPO (howsoever designated) or the National 
Police Improvement Agency (to be superseded by the College of Policing). Neither is it clear 
to me how the work of the HMIC will be affected, or what (if any) impact there will be on the 
IPCC. All that I can do is to describe the architecture, and others will need to take it forward by 
inserting the building-blocks as relationships and responsibilities are established. I recognise 
that each of the bodies I have mentioned will wish to contribute to that debate and a number 
have not given evidence to the Inquiry.

993

Chapter 4 | The Press and the Police: Conclusions and RecommendationsG8.14 

In	the	circumstances,	I	recommend	that	an	enhanced	system	for	protection	of	whistle	
blowers	 and	 for	 providing	 assistance	 for	 the	 Police	 Service	 on	 general	 ethical	 issues	
should	at	least	comprise	the	following:

(a)	
(b)	

(c)	

greater	prominence	should	be	given	to	the	IPCC’s	PIDA	telephone	line;
there	should	be	an	‘ethics	line’	to	the	IPCC,	available	for	all	serving	Police	Officers,	
providing	general	ethical	guidance;
to	 avail	 those	 at	 Chief	 Officer	 level	 (Assistant	 Commissioner	 level	 within	 the	
MPS),	HMIC	should	identify	one	of	its	members,	a	former	Chief	Constable,	as	the	
designated	point	of	contact	for	confidential	ethics	guidance.	The	Chief	Officer	
seeking	and	obtaining	that	advice	would	be	able	to	refer	to	it	should	any	issue	
subsequently	arise	on	a	complaint	to	a	PSD,	a	PCC,	or	indeed	the	IPCC	itself.	The	
advice	 would	 not	 be	 determinative	 of	 the	 complaint,	 but	 the	 fact	 that	 it	 was	
sought	and	received,	as	well	as	its	content,	would	be	a	matter	to	be	taken	into	
account;

(e)	

(d)	 within	the	IPCC	itself,	there	is	a	need	for	an	enhanced	‘filter	system’	whereby	
the	nature	of	complaints	are	appropriately	addressed	at	an	early	stage	so	that	
(a)	they	can	be	investigated	at	the	right	level,	and	(b)	sufficient	structures	are	put	
in	place	to	maintain	confidentiality	of	the	complaint,	and	differentiate	as	soon	
as	is	appropriate	between	genuine	whistle	blowers	and	those	who	are	merely	
ventilating	a	personal	grievance;
the	 former	 Chief	 Constable	 referred	 to	 under	 sub-paragraph	 (c)	 above	 should	
also	be	the	recipient	of	complaints	about	Chief	Constables	made	to	the	IPCC.	In	
the	event	that	he	or	she	may	already	have	given	informal	advice	in	relation	to	
the	subject-matter	of	the	complaint,	as	per	sub-paragraph	(c)	above,	a	substitute	
HMI	would	be	deputed	to	act;	and
Chief	 Officers	 should	 also	 be	 the	 subject	 of	 regular	 independent	 scrutiny	 by	
HMIC,	including	through	unannounced	inspections.

(f)	

8.15  As I have said, and for the reasons I have given, I am not addressing the actual mechanics of 
such a system in this Report. But allied to this, I would also consider it prudent for PCCs and 
Chief  Officers  quickly  to  reassess  the  corporate  governance  arrangements  in  place  within 
each force area to ensure that they are fit for purpose. This would obviously be an important 
part of ensuring that each of their specific roles and responsibilities in this area are clearly 
delineated.

9.	 Conclusion
9.1 

It is clear that the Police Service as a whole has responded positively and proactively in the 
wake of the public concerns which led to the setting up of this Inquiry in July 2011. I welcome 
the thoroughness and good sense of the changes which have been recommended to date, 
and  the  spirit  in  which  the  Police  Service  has  demonstrated  willingness  for  implementing 
appropriate  and  judicious  enhancements  of  the  existing  regimes.  Ultimately,  the  Police 
Service in general and the MPS in particular has understood the importance of such a positive 
response in terms of allaying public concerns and correction legitimate perceptions.

9.2 

In taking its existing work forward, as supplemented by the recommendations I have made 
in this Chapter, I fully endorse the judicious contribution made by the Home Secretary to 
the Inquiry and, in particular, her emphasis on the need for a country-wide series of policies

application. The ‘blush test’ will continue to work as a sound guide for the vast majority but 
clear leadership and the setting of the tone from the top is vital. Finally, clear and direct policy 
guidance is necessary to reinforce these common sense messages.
