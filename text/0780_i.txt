1.1 

Introduction
On, 13 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a statement to the House of Commons in these 
terms:1

“In recent days, the whole country has been shocked by the revelations of the phone 
hacking scandal. What this country—and the House—has to confront is an episode 
that is, frankly, disgraceful: accusations of widespread lawbreaking by parts of our 
press: alleged corruption by some police officers; and, as we have just discussed, the 
failure of our political system over many, many years to tackle a problem that has 
been getting worse. We must at all times keep the real victims at the front and centre 
of  this  debate.  Relatives  of  those  who  died  at  the  hands  of  terrorism,  war  heroes 
and murder victims—people who have already suffered in a way that we can barely 
imagine—have been made to suffer all over again.
I believe that we all want the same thing: press, police and politicians who serve the 
public. Last night the Deputy Prime Minister and I met the Leader of the Opposition. 
I also met the Chairs of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the Home Affairs 
Committee  and  the  Justice  Committee  to  discuss  the  best  way  forward.  Following 
these consultations, I want to set out today how we intend to proceed: first, on the 
public  inquiry;  secondly,  on  the  issues  surrounding  News  International’s  proposed 
takeover of BSkyB; and thirdly, on ethics in the police service and its relationship with 
the press.
Before  I  do  that,  I  will  update  the  House  on  the  current  criminal  investigation 
into  phone  hacking.  I  met  Sir  Paul  Stephenson  last  night.  He  assured  me  that  the 
investigation  is  fully  resourced.  It  is  one  of  the  largest  currently  under  way  in  the 
country, and is being carried out by a completely different team from the one that 
carried out the original investigation. It is being led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner 
Sue Akers, who I believe impressed the Home Affairs Committee yesterday. Her team 
is looking through 11,000 pages containing 3,870 names, and around 4,000 mobile 
and 5,000 landline phone numbers. The team has contacted 170 people so far, and 
will  contact  every  single  person  named  in  those  documents.  The  commissioner’s 
office informed me this morning that the team has so far made eight arrests and 
undertaken numerous interviews.
Let me now turn to the action that the Government are taking. Last week in the House 
I set out our intention to establish an independent public inquiry into phone hacking 
and other illegal practices in the British press. We have looked carefully at what the 
nature of the inquiry should be. We want it to be one that is as robust as possible—
one that can get to the truth fastest and also get to work the quickest, and, vitally, one 
that commands the full confidence of the public. Clearly there are two pieces of work 
that have to be done. First, we need a full investigation into wrongdoing in the press 
and the police, including the failure of the first police investigation. Secondly, we need 
a review of regulation of the press. We would like to get on with both those elements 
as quickly as possible, while being mindful of the ongoing criminal investigations. So, 

1 HC Hansard, 13 July 2011, vol 531, col 311-312

Aafter listening carefully, we have decided that the best way to proceed is with one 
inquiry, but in two parts.
I can tell the House that the inquiry will be led by one of the most senior judges in 
the  country,  Lord  Justice  Leveson.  He  will  report  to  both  the  Home  Secretary  and 
the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The inquiry will be established 
under the Inquiries Act 2005, which means that it will have the power to summon 
witnesses, including newspaper reporters, management, proprietors, policemen and 
politicians of all parties, to give evidence under oath and in public. …
Starting  as  soon  as  possible,  Lord  Justice  Leveson,  assisted  by  a  panel  of  senior 
independent  figures  with  relevant  expertise  in  media,  broadcasting,  regulation 
and government will inquire into the culture, practices and ethics of the press; its 
relationship  with  the  police;  the  failure  of  the  current  system  of  regulation;  the 
contacts made, and discussions had, between national newspapers and politicians; 
why previous warnings about press misconduct were not heeded; and the issue of 
cross-media ownership. He will make recommendations for a new, more effective way 
of regulating the press—one that supports its freedom, plurality and independence 
from  Government,  but  which  also  demands  the  highest  ethical  and  professional 
standards. He will also make recommendations about the future conduct of relations 
between politicians and the press. That part of the inquiry we hope will report within 
12 months.
The second part of the inquiry will examine the extent of unlawful or improper conduct 
at the News of the World and other newspapers, and the way in which management 
failures may have allowed it to happen. That part of the inquiry will also look into 
the original police investigation and the issue of corrupt payments to police officers, 
and will consider the implications for the relationships between newspapers and the 
police. Lord Justice Leveson has agreed to these draft terms of reference. I am placing 
them in the Library today, and we will send them to the devolved Administrations. No 
one should be in any doubt of our intention to get to the bottom of the truth and learn 
the lessons for the future.”

1.2 

The Terms of Reference were then the subject of further discussion both with the devolved 
administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and other interested parties. The 
Prime Minister returned to the topic on 20 July 2011, when announcing the appointment of 
the Assessors. He said:2

“We  have  made  some  significant  amendments  to  the  remit  of  the  inquiry.  With 
allegations that the problem of the relationship between the press and the police 
goes wider than just the Met, we have agreed that other relevant forces will now be 
within the scope of the inquiry. We have agreed that the inquiry should consider not 
just  the  relationship  between  the  press,  police  and  politicians,  but  their  individual 
conduct too. We have also made it clear that the inquiry should look not just at the 
press, but at other media organisations, including broadcasters and social media if 
there is any evidence that they have been involved in criminal activities.”

1.3 

Thus, the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry, as finally drafted, are:

part 1
1.  To inquire into the culture, practices, and ethics of the press, including:

2 HC Hansard, 20 July 2011, vol 531, col 919

PART A | The InquiryA(a) contacts and the relationships between national newspapers and politicians, 

and the conduct of each;

(b) contacts  and  the  relationship  between  the  press  and  the  police,  and  the 

conduct of each;

(c)  the extent to which the current policy and regulatory framework has failed 

including in relation to data protection; and

(d) the  extent  to  which  there  was  a  failure  to  act  on  previous  warnings  about 

media misconduct.

2.  To make recommendations:

(a) for  a  new  more  effective  policy  and  regulatory  regime  which  supports 
the  integrity  and  freedom  of  the  press,  the  plurality  of  the  media,  and  its 
independence,  including  from  Government,  while  encouraging  the  highest 
ethical and professional standards;

(b) for how future concerns about press behaviour, media policy, regulation and 
cross-media ownership should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities, 
including Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police;

(c)  the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press; and
(d) the future conduct of relations between the police and the press.

part 2
3.  To inquire into the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, 
other newspaper organisations and, as appropriate, other organisations within the 
media, and by those responsible for holding personal data.
4.  To inquire into the way in which any relevant police force investigated allegations or 
evidence of unlawful conduct by persons within or connected with News International, 
the review by the Metropolitan Police of their initial investigation, and the conduct of 
the prosecuting authorities.
5.  To inquire into the extent to which the police received corrupt payments or other 
inducements, or were otherwise complicit in such misconduct or in suppressing its 
proper investigation, and how this was allowed to happen.
6.  To  inquire  into  the  extent  of  corporate  governance  and  management  failures 
at  News  International  and  other  newspaper  organisations,  and  the  role,  if  any, 
of  politicians,  public  servants  and  others  in  relation  to  any  failure  to  investigate 
wrongdoing at News International
7.  In the light of these inquiries, to consider the implications for the relationships 
between  newspaper  organisations  and  the  police,  prosecuting  authorities,  and 
relevant regulatory bodies – and to recommend what actions, if any, should be taken.

1.4 

By letter dated 28 July 2011,3 as responsible Ministers under the Inquiries Act 2005, the Rt 
Hon Jeremy Hunt MP (then the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sports) and Baroness 
Browning (then a Minister of State at the Home Office) appointed me to Chair the Inquiry 
pursuant to s3(1)(a) of the Act. On the same date, their appointment having previously been 
announced  by  the  Prime  Minister,  acting  pursuant  to  s11(2)(a)  of  the  Act,  the  Ministers 
appointed six Assessors with a wide range of professional experience to assist the Inquiry.

1.7 

These were Sir David Bell,4 Shami Chakrabarti CBE,5 Lord (David) Currie,6 Elinor Goodman,7 
George Jones8 and Sir Paul Scott-Lee.9

From  the  day  of  the  announcement  of  my  appointment,  it  was  necessary  to  identify 
appropriate support. A Director General with a legal background and experience at the Home 
Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Rowena Collins 
Rice was an ideal appointment as Secretary to the Inquiry. Kim Brudenell, a senior solicitor 
from the Treasury Solicitor’s office was appointed Solicitor to the Inquiry; Amanda Jeffery 
(from the Judicial Office) and Rachel Clark (from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport 
and previously the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) were appointed as Heads 
of Administration and Research respectively. With an eye on prudent financial management, 
suitable civil servants from across Government were recruited to staff the Inquiry and ensure 
that it could proceed expeditiously and efficiently.

I also set about appointing counsel. With the assistance of the Treasury Solicitor, I selected 
Robert Jay QC to be Counsel to the Inquiry; with my approval he nominated David Barr and 
Carine Patry Hoskins as junior Counsel, later adding Lucinda Boon for Module 2 (concerning 
the relationship between the press and the police). Counsel were assisted by junior members 
of  the  Bar  in  relation  to  the  necessary  research  for  both  preparing  the  examination  of 
witnesses and the subsequent collation of the evidence.

At the very beginning of this Report, it is appropriate to record my enormous gratitude to the 
Assessors, to Counsel and to the entire Inquiry team (whose names are set out in Appendix A 
to this Report) for their unstinting commitment to the Inquiry and the prodigious effort that 
has been put into ensuring that it proceeded smoothly, to budget and, most important, was 
able appropriately to address the Terms of Reference within a time frame that aIlows early 
consideration to be given by the Government and Parliament to the way forward.

2.  role of the assessors
2.1 

From  the  outset,  challenges  were  mounted  by  a  number  of  press  interests  to  the  way  in 
which the Inquiry was set up and, in particular, to the experience, role and responsibility of 
the Assessors. Having obtained cross party support for their appointment, when identifying 
them by name,10 the Prime Minister said of them “these people have been chosen not only 
for their expertise in the media, broadcasting, regulation and policing, but for their complete 
independence from the interested parties.”

2.2 

At the opening session of the Inquiry, I spoke of the Assessors having “a central role in the work” 
so that the report would be a “collaborative effort” and that if a particular recommendation 
was not unanimous, “I shall make the contrary view clear.” It was argued that this would make 
the Assessors into members of the panel pursuant to s4 of the Inquiries Act 2005 and that 
they lacked balance on the basis that their number included nobody with tabloid or mid-
market newspaper experience.

PART A | The InquiryA2.3 

In a ruling of 17 October 2011,11 I rejected the view that the Assessors were a hybrid between 
assessors within the meaning of s11 of the Inquiries Act 2005 and members of the determining 
panel (as set out in s4). I set out the role for assessors in para 3 of the Assessor Protocol in 
these terms:12

“An assessor will take such part in the proceedings of the Inquiry as the Chairman 
may request, and in particular the Chairman may at any time request an assessor to:

(a)  Attend the whole or part of any hearing, seminar or briefing; and/or
(b) Chair the whole or part of any seminar in an area of his or her expertise; and/

or

(c)  Prepare a report for the Chairman on any matter relevant to the Inquiry within 

the area of expertise of the assessor; and/or

(d) Provide to Counsel to the Inquiry suggested lines of questioning for witnesses, 

in respect of any matters within his or her expertise; and/or

(e) Provide  the  Chairman  with  any  other  assistance,  or  advice,  on  any  matter 

relevant to the Inquiry within the expertise of the assessor.”

2.4 

In the event that an Assessor prepared a report that I intended to take into account, paragraph 
4 of the Protocol made it clear that it should be disclosed to the Core Participants (who could 
submit observations upon it) and thereafter published as part of the evidence. In the event, 
I have not asked any Assessor to prepare a report that I intend to take into account; there is 
no question of any providing me with ‘evidence’ or other material which it is appropriate to 
share with Core Participants in order that they may make submissions about it. The extent to 
which the Assessors would take part in or impact upon my conclusions was also explained in 
my ruling which includes a description of their role and responsibilities in these terms:13

“30.  The  assessors  also  bring  an  understanding  of  the  practical  implications  of 
potential ways forward – what may, or may not, work in the fields of their respective 
expertise. It is that to which I refer when I speak of being collaborative and ‘striving 
for  unanimity’.  There  is  absolutely  no  point  in  my  suggesting  a  way  forward  (if 
different from the present system) that everyone decries as unworkable; if that were 
my provisional view, I would want to be told. The process I envisage would entail, 
amongst other things, seeking the assistance and advice of my assessors but, as I have 
also explained, I may also test out possible solutions in further seminars. Again, with 
fairness as my touchstone, if I believe that new material is generated, that material 
will be shared so that all can make submissions upon it.

31  Ultimately,  however,  as  I  have  made  very  clear,  my  conclusions  shall  be  solely 
my conclusions. There is no question of publishing concurring views. In the spirit of 
openness  and  transparency,  however,  I  shall  identify  the  fact  that  one  or  more  of 
the  assessors  disagrees  with  my  conclusions  and  I  shall  explain  the  nature  of  the 
disagreement: in that way, those who read my report will be able to make up their 
own minds.”

2.5 

The Assessors have been scrupulous to follow the approach set out in the Protocol and ruling. 
They have assisted in relation to avenues of investigation and lines of enquiry both generally 
and to specific witnesses. Although there has been repeated criticism of the Inquiry for not

Chapter 1 | The AnnouncementAengaging  an  assessor  with  experience  of  tabloid  or  mid-market  newspapers  (along  with 
suggestions that nobody working in a broadsheet newspaper would be able to understand 
the dynamics of tabloid or mid-market journalism), nobody has suggested in evidence that 
the approach to ethical issues should be different. In any event, far from ignoring the different 
interests to which tabloid and mid-market newspapers appeal, the Assessors with experience 
of journalism have been assiduous to keep me aware, both in advance and as I was hearing 
the evidence, of the arguments that have in fact been put forward in favour of the needs 
of this profitable sector of the market. In doing so, they have continuously emphasised the 
perspective  that  was  trailed  particularly  by  Trevor  Kavanagh  and  Kelvin  MacKenzie  in  the 
seminars and underlined by editors and journalists working for titles from these sectors when 
they gave evidence. They have kept at the front of my mind the ways in which those titles 
appeal to their very large readership and the vital importance of ensuring that it is taken into 
account in full measure – which I have done.

2.6 

The role of the Assessors was described by me in my ruling of 17 October 2011, when I said:14

“27.  It is obviously desirable (as the Prime Minister and others have identified) that 
I obtain advice and assistance from those who have made their lives and careers in 
the various areas covered by the Inquiry, in particular in relation to dealings between 
the press and the public, the press and politicians and the propriety of press contact 
with the police. Not least, this is because I would be keen to understand any flaws or 
unintended consequences that might flow from suggestions that are advanced that 
my lack of experience would not otherwise identify. That is not to make the assessors 
advocates for any particular cause and that is not how I (or they) see their role.”

2.7 

2.8 

2.9 

Neither has any of the Assessors sought to act as an advocate. It has recently been suggested 
in  a  number  of  press  reports  that,  in  the  some  way,  I  have  been  subject,  on  the  part  of 
my  Assessors,  to  hidden  lobbying,  political  partisanship  or  self-interested  influence  with 
specific agendas in mind. That is untrue. Having spent over 40 years seeking to persuade 
or influence, or listening to others trying to do the same, if it had been attempted or even 
crept in unconsciously, I would have detected it very quickly. I have found the assistance of 
my Assessors, in their areas of expertise and experience, invaluable. They will, however, not 
mind my saying here what I have assured them of many times as we have gone along: that 
my task in response has been to sift, weigh and test what they have said and make such use 
of it as seems to me right.

It  should  be  remembered  that  the  Assessors  were  selected  by  the  Prime  Minister  who,  I 
repeat, described them as having been chosen “for their complete independence from the 
interested  parties”.  The  Leader  of  the  Opposition  welcomed  the  Inquiry  and  “indeed  the 
panel members chosen by the Prime Minister”. After they were nominated, I spoke to each at 
length and satisfied myself that the Prime Minister was right.

Full  declarations  of  possible  conflict  were  made  by  each  before  the  start  of  the  Inquiry: 
along with their CVs, these have been published on the Inquiry website throughout. When 
challenging the position of the Assessors in the argument that led to the ruling to which I 
have referred, Jonathan Caplan QC for Associated Newspapers Ltd submitted that the three 
journalist Assessors were not representative of the industry but made it clear, in terms, that 
he  recognised  that  there  was  no  statutory  requirement  that  an  Assessor  be  impartial.15  I

15 Ibid, paragraph 20

PART A | The InquiryAunderline that. It is an Assessor’s task to offer me the benefit of his or her personal perspective, 
expertise and experience. It is mine to take the impartial view.

2.10  The duty of confidence which the Assessors owe by law in relation to the internal deliberations 
of  the  Inquiry  is  there  to  enable  them  to  provide  their  expertise  fully  and  frankly  and  to 
protect them from external pressures. In fact, nothing that the Assessors have said or done 
during  the  course  of  the  Inquiry  would  allow  anyone  to  suggest  that  they  had  gone  any 
further than precisely to perform the role set out in my ruling. I make one further point about 
the Assessors. None has been concerned with or involved in any the decisions of fact, where 
I have had to make my mind up about what I considered had been established to the relevant 
standard. Those parts of the Report that depend only on a forensic analysis of issues of fact 
or issues outside their expertise (for example, Part I Chapter 6 in relation to the bid for the 
shares of BSkyB plc), have not even been seen prior to publication of the Report. 

3.  Visits
3.1 

In an effort, at least in part, to assuage concern that I had no experience or perception of 
the  issues  faced  by  the  newspaper  industry  and  the  way  in  which  newspapers  operate,  I 
have been very willing to receive evidence on the topic. Additionally, I offered to undertake 
private visits to any newspaper title that invited me. I was clear that one such newspaper 
should  be  regionally  based  and,  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Inquiry,  I  visited  the 
Southern Daily Echo in Southampton, the offices of Associated Newspapers Ltd (The Daily 
Mail and The Sunday Mail), Trinity Mirror plc (The Daily Mirror, The Sunday Mirror and The 
People) and News International Ltd (The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times). I was treated 
with courtesy at each and shown not only the layout and operation but also aspects of the 
production of online editions.

3.2 

Towards  the  end  of  the  hearings,  I  was  invited  to  the  offices  of  the  Press  Complaints 
Commission: having regard to the very extensive evidence that I had received both as to the 
operation of the Commission and the approach of its staff, I felt that to do so could give rise to 
misunderstanding and, furthermore, did not consider that it would add to my understanding 
of the issues. In the circumstances, I declined that invitation.

The approaCh

1.	 Setting	up	and	preliminaries
1.1 

This Inquiry is unlike any other for a number of reasons. The principal reason concerns the 
way in which Inquiries are generally conducted. Usually, an event such as a disaster or other 
type of incident giving rise to public concern occurs. The natural anxiety is to learn, first of 
all,  what  precisely  has  caused  the  event  to  happen  and,  thereafter,  what  should  be  done 
to prevent repetition. Albeit based on an inquisitorial model (with Counsel to the Inquiry 
conducting the forensic investigation), a judicial inquiry will thereafter proceed rather as any 
judicial investigation or trial might. Witnesses to the incident will be called and the Inquiry 
panel will then exercise the usual functions of a judge sitting alone and ‘find’ the facts, that is 
to say, on the balance of probabilities, reach conclusions as to what actually happened. This 
exercise will usually involve deciding precisely what, as a matter of fact, caused or led to the 
event, who was responsible for making what decisions and what impact those decisions have 
had.

1.2 

1.3 

A civil (or criminal) trial would then go further and determine the standard required by the 
civil (or criminal) law and decide whether that standard has been met. If it has not, civil (or 
criminal) liability will result. In the former case, damages or some other remedy will follow to 
benefit those who have suffered injury or financial loss as a consequence. A conviction in a 
criminal trial will lead to the imposition of a sanction or sentence. An Inquiry, however, does 
not lead to these consequences. Although the facts will be found as to what has happened 
and why, an Inquiry will go on to recommend steps that might be taken in the future to avoid 
similar problems. There is and will be no determination of civil or criminal liability.1

The  difference  in  the  case  of  this  Inquiry  is  the  fact  of  the  criminal  investigations  being 
undertaken  by  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service  (MPS).  The  most  important  are  Operation 
Weeting (into the interception of mobile telephone messages), Operation Elveden (into the 
payment of police officers, and, indeed, others holding public office or position, by the press) 
and Operation Tuleta (into other forms of computer hacking). These and other subsidiary 
investigations are proceeding apace and, during the course of the Inquiry, there have been 
a large number of arrests with journalists and others being bailed for further inquiries to be 
made. In a number of cases, criminal prosecutions have been commenced; these are presently 
awaiting trial and I anticipate that there will continue to be developments in the period which 
follows the publication of this Report. This is the reason for the Inquiry being split into two 
parts (with the question “who did what to whom” generally falling within Part 2, which is 
intended to follow the conclusion of any criminal prosecutions). One consequence, however, 
is that any investigation of the facts has inevitably been circumscribed, in particular, by an 
inability to investigate the full detail of specific criminality in the core areas of interception of 
mobile telephone voice mail messages and alleged bribery of public officials.

1.4 

This  limitation  must  be  put  in  context.  Concern  about  this  type  of  activity  constituted  an 
important factor leading to the establishment of this Inquiry and the issue cannot be ignored: 
it is one of the central reasons for public concern about the conduct of the press (or sections 
of  it).  In relation  to each of those who  have been charged or arrested, however, criminal 
proceedings are active (within the meaning of the Contempt of Court Act 1981).

Chapter 2  |  The Approach

This has two consequences, the implications of which are important. First, to avoid prejudice 
to any criminal investigation or prosecution, there are inevitable limitations on the extent to 
which it is appropriate to examine the evidence relating to specific incidents of such practices, 
let alone in relation to the identification of those who might have been involved. Second, the 
rights of those who have been charged or arrested must be respected and, in particular, their 
right not to self incriminate must be protected. This could arise either by the Inquiry inviting 
answers to potentially incriminating questions or, inferentially, by putting them in a position 
that  refusal  to  answer  questions  itself  generates  suspicion.  In  the  circumstances,  none  of 
those who have been arrested has been asked questions about interception of voice mail 
messages or payments to public officials.2 Taking full account of these issues, however, the 
rights of individuals do not mean that it is inappropriate to consider, as a matter of generality, 
the extent to which there was a recognised and understood willingness to obtain information 
in this way albeit in some cases, perhaps, without knowledge of (or, at the very least, due 
regard to) the relevant criminal law.

In any event, Part 1 of the Terms of Reference covers very much more than this activity. In 
relation to the press and the public, quite apart from the admirable journalism conducted 
entirely  in  the  public  interest,  and  journalism  which  sets  out  simply  to  entertain  harming 
nobody,  its  culture,  practices  and  ethics  cover  many  other  types  of  conduct  which  have 
been the subject of complaint. Without intending to create a definitive list, these include 
deception  (‘blagging’),  bullying  (by  reporters  of  members  of  the  public  and  by  editors  of 
reporters  in  order  to  obtain  stories),  breaches  of  privacy  and  harassment,  other  forms  of 
intrusion,  misleading  or  inaccurate  stories  or  headlines  whether  deliberate  or  accidental, 
discrimination and other conduct that breaches the Editors’ Code of Conduct.

Scope
This  Inquiry  has  covered  the  “culture,  practices  and  ethics  of  the  press”  which  obviously 
includes newspapers whether printed or online: it does not include broadcasters (ultimately 
regulated by Ofcom). Thus, although the Director General of the BBC, then Mark Thompson, 
gave evidence, he did so only to provide a comparison between the approach adopted internally 
by  the  BBC  Trust  along  with  the  oversight  from  Ofcom.  In  those  circumstances,  although 
there have been many calls during the Inquiry for me to expand the terms of reference to 
investigate other organisations (most recently the BBC in the wake of the allegations against 
Sir Jimmy Savile), it is simply outside the Terms of Reference within which I am working.

Part 1 also covers the culture, practices and ethics of the press across a far wider canvass than 
the way in which it deals with the public. It is concerned with the relationship between the 
press and the police. This encompasses allegations that the two have become far too close, 
involving  the  payment  of  money  or  the  provision  of  other  favours  for  inside  information, 
prior  notice  of  newsworthy  incidents  or  participation  in  high  profile  operations  (including 
presence at arrests). It also covers the cross fertilisation of employment with retired senior 
police officers being engaged as newspaper columnists and journalists being employed in 
PR departments or as PR advisers by police services. Part 1 also deals with the relationship 
between the press and politicians including, in particular, the perception that, in return for 
political support, politicians have been too ready to allow undue influence to be exercised 
in relation to policy and that, in any event, the relationship between the two has not been 
transparent.

November-PDF-106KB.pdf

A1.9 

Taken together, this remit is almost breathtaking in its width and, from the beginning, I have 
been extremely conscious of a number of very significant consequences of the task that I have 
undertaken and the need to cope with those consequences. First, it would be all too easy to 
allow an investigation of the issues to spiral out of control and to become far too enmeshed 
in detail at the expense of the overall picture. Examples could be provided of concerns which 
focus on individual aspects of the Inquiry and it would be entirely legitimate to subject each 
to detailed analysis, providing the opportunity to anyone affected or potentially affected to 
challenge the inferences to be drawn. In some cases, for good reason, detail at that level has, 
indeed, been necessary. The contrary approach, with no attention paid to specifics, would risk 
creating an overview that is far too general and has little value as a true narrative of events.

1.10  The need to ensure a balanced approach to the facts has to be reflected in the context of the 
second consideration. That is the broad time frame within which it important for me to report. 
I put it in that way because, without suggesting that the period of one year identified by the 
Prime Minister constitutes (or was intended to constitute) a straight-jacket, the imperative to 
deal with this issue is real; public concern at the time of the closure of the News of the World 
(NoTW) was intense and it is important to address the problems that were perceived and are 
now recognised in relation to the regulation of the press as a matter of urgency.

1.11 

In any event, this consideration chimes with the question of cost. At a time of fiscal austerity 
for the public and increasing pressure on the commerciality of the newspaper industry, it 
was always important that time and the resources of both were well used and not wasted on 
an analysis of detail that was too extensive and unnecessary for the purposes of providing a 
sufficient narrative. Cost is not just about legal and other financial outlay, whether by Core 
Participant members of the public who do not qualify for legal assistance, public authorities 
such as the police or police authorities, the newspaper industry or the Ministries required to 
fund the running of the Inquiry. Cost also encompasses the energy and time commitment of 
all whether participant or witness, both in responding to calls for evidence (which, in some 
cases, has involved an enormous amount of work) or attending to give oral evidence.

Engagement

1.12  The third consideration has been my anxiety to ensure that the industry is fully engaged in 
the process and to avoid the risk that this imposed Inquiry requires or has meant that their 
only role is to be reactive or, perhaps more serious, entirely defensive. In that regard, one 
concern (evidenced in fact) has been that parts of the press would consider that I approached 
the  Inquiry  without  the  necessary  and,  in  my  view,  entirely  appropriate  enthusiasm  and 
absolute commitment to freedom of expression and the independence of the press; and that 
this concern would fashion their approach to the Inquiry, impact on the assistance that they 
provided and colour the way in which they viewed any conclusion I might reach. A subsidiary 
concern  has  been  that  whatever  view  I  might  have  about  these  fundamental  freedoms,  I 
would change them in the light of what they perceive to be unbalanced evidence of problems. 
Of course, as many have reported, it has been inevitable that a large body of the evidence 
would be uncomfortable for the press, if not worse, and that the positive features of our 
press both at a national and regional level would be lost in the welter of criticism, although 
reflective consideration will demonstrate that any Inquiry of this nature will inevitably focus 
on the problems. As I will repeat at various stages throughout this Report, I am very conscious 
that most journalism, most of the time meets high standards and can compete with the best 
journalism in the world; the Inquiry has been concerned with that which does not.

12

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

1.13  The fourth consideration has been the interests of the public. I have made the point that 
the public interest in the issues identified in the Terms of Reference is intense and, in my 
judgment, correctly so. It has thus been vital to ensure that the Inquiry proceeded in a way 
that engaged the public and provided appropriate access to it. By access, I do not mean only 
that the hearing of the Inquiry would be in public for that goes without saying. The concern 
has been to find ways, first, of providing the public with information as to the framework 
of law and regulation within which the press operate; second, of ensuring that the public 
has maximum access to the evidence and the material which forms the basis of my Report; 
third, of allowing and encouraging the public to feed their views into the Inquiry without 
losing the necessary judicial rigour with which any Inquiry must be conducted or creating the 
perception that I am effectively engaged in what is little more than a substantial exercise in 
public consultation.

1.14 

I approached these problems in a number of different ways which I explain in chronological 
order of them being put into practice. In order to provide some coherence to the evidence 
and so that the public could understand the approach of the Inquiry, the Terms of Reference 
were split into four modules: the Press and the Public, the Press and the Police, the Press 
and the Politicians and, finally, the Future. The first three modules were designed to provide 
the platform for focused evidence broadly dealing with the topic in question. I say ‘broadly’ 
because I have not wanted to trouble witnesses with necessarily having to return to give 
evidence for each module. Thus, during the module concerned with the Press and the Public, 
the relevant editors were asked about payments or other inducements to police officers (which 
is Module Two), along with questions about meetings with and influence upon politicians. 
Conversely, certain witnesses (and, in particular, Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, Rebekah 
Brooks and Andrew Coulson) were, or at least could be (subject to allowance in the cases of 
Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson to the fact that, at the time they gave evidence, they had been 
arrested as part of the police investigation and have now both been charged) central to a 
number of modules and I took the view that it was more sensible to deal with all aspects of 
the Inquiry towards the conclusion of the oral evidence.

1.15  Furthermore, the fourth module (the Future) was not intended, as might have been thought, 
to be free-standing. From the outset, I have been concerned to challenge all or most of the 
witnesses to provide ideas for the future. I have then tested them with other witnesses and 
encouraged  a  continued  dialogue  between  all  those  affected  by  the  issues  which  are  the 
subject matter of the Inquiry. In that way, I have endeavoured to ensure that, parallel to the 
Inquiry, others (including the industry, academic journalists and those interested in this area) 
engage in dialogues to ensure that all possible mechanisms for regulation are examined and 
considered. The purpose of Module Four, therefore, was to test possible approaches and so 
ensure that the final Report did as much as it possibly could to take account of all concerns 
and reflect a solution that not only balances the legitimate interests of all those affected by 
the way in which the press goes about its business, but also provides a solution, or series of 
solutions, that have been submitted to rigorous analysis and, hopefully, can work in the real 
world.

1.16 

Briefing sessions
In addition to splitting the Terms of Reference into four modules, I took other steps to provide 
sufficient bedrock on which to build consideration of the evidence as to the need for change 
and the future. Having signalled my intentions and rejected submissions that it would not be 

13

Aappropriate to proceed in this way,3 the second preliminary step was to organise a series of 
briefing sessions to set out the technical, legal and regulatory framework both for me and 
the assessors.

1.17  Although  running  contrary  to  my  fundamental  approach  to  the  Inquiry,  I  agreed  that  the 
technical briefing (to explain methods of interception of telephone and IT systems) should be 
conducted in private, on the basis that there was no justification for putting into the public 
domain methods whereby the unscrupulous could learn how to commit what are, in fact, 
criminal offences. An approved summary of that briefing is, however, available and has been 
posted on the website. The other briefings concerned the criminal and civil law framework 
within which the press operate and the regulatory framework, both in relation to the press 
(presently through the Press Complaints Commission PCC) and also in other, comparatively 
related, industries. Although these briefings were not recorded, transcripts were prepared 
and anyone interested in the subject matter of the Inquiry has been in a position to acquaint 
themselves  with  the  framework  of  law  and  regulation  in  order  better  to  understand  the 
issues that the Inquiry intended to address. These briefings are not formal parts of the record 
of the Inquiry; I am, however, satisfied that they accurately reflected the current position 
and, where those who provided them gave evidence, they were happy to incorporate into the 
record what they said at the briefings.

Seminars

1.18  The third preliminary step, after the briefing sessions, was to seek to widen understanding 
of the background  and the present state of the industry while at the same time distilling 
the issues and starting the debate. This was taken forward by three seminars held over two 
full days. Again, these seminars are not formal parts of the record but, again, in the case 
of  all  those  who  gave  presentations  or  otherwise  contributed  and  who  later  attended  to 
give evidence, each attested to the accuracy of what he or she then said and accepted that 
their  contribution  should  be  taken  as  part  of  their  evidence.  In  each  case,  after  a  formal 
presentation,  there  was  an  open  debate  before  an  invited  audience.  The  seminars  were 
recorded  and  a  transcript  of  the  day  was  also  prepared:  along  with  the  briefing  sessions, 
these remain available on the website and can all be accessed on the website both to watch 
and to read.4

1.19  The first set of seminars, on Thursday 6 October 2011, was called “The Competitive Pressures 
on the Press and the Impact on Journalism”. It was chaired by Sir David Bell, supported by 
Elinor Goodman and George Jones, and received presentations from Claire Enders of Enders 
Analysis on the competitive pressures facing the press today; Phil Hall (former editor of the 
NoTW,  Hello!  Magazine  and  director  of  the  editorial  department  at  Trinity  Mirror  plc)  on 
how the press operates in a competitive environment and the pressures facing editors; and 
Richard Peppiatt (formerly a reporter on the Daily Star) on the day to day effect of competitive 
pressures on working journalists. The second seminar, similarly chaired, was called “The Rights 
and  Responsibilities  of  the  Press”  and  received  first  a  presentation  from  Alan  Rusbridger 
(editor-in-chief of the Guardian) on why a free press matters. This was followed by Trevor 
Kavanagh (formerly political editor and now an associate editor and political columnist on 
The Sun) and Professor Brian Cathcart (formerly deputy editor of The Independent on Sunday 
and  now  Professor  of  Journalism  at  Kingston  University  and  a  founder  of  the  Hacked  Off 
campaign),  both  of  whom  spoke  about  whether  there  is  a  difference  between  the  public

interest and the interest of the public and what questions this raised in relation to a single set 
of journalistic ethics.

1.20  The second day of seminars was held on Wednesday 12 October 2011. The third seminar 
was called  “Supporting  a free press and  high  standards  – Approaches to Regulation”.  The 
morning was chaired by Lord Currie, supported by Shami Chakrabarti. Presentations were 
provided on the future for self regulation from the different perspectives of a regulator, an 
editor and a user by Eve Salomon (a former PCC Commissioner and currently Chair of the 
Internet Watch Foundation), Paul Dacre (editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers Ltd and 
chair  of  the  Editors’  Code  Committee  of  the  PCC)  and  Will  Moy  (Director  of  Full  Fact,  an 
independent fact-checking organisation) respectively. The role of corporate governance was 
considered by Lord Borrie (formerly Director General of Fair Trading and thereafter Chair of 
the Advertising Standards Authority), Stephen Hill (formerly Chief Executive Officer of the 
Financial Times and now a non-executive director of Channel Four television) and Sly Bailey 
(then Chief Executive of Trinity Mirror plc).

1.21 

In the afternoon, chaired by Shami Chakrabarti supported by Lord Currie, redress for breach 
of  standards  was  discussed  by  Professor  Steven  Barnett  (Professor  of  Communications  at 
the  University  of  Westminster),  Desmond  Browne  QC  (a  leading  media  silk  and  formerly 
Chairman of the Bar)5 and Professor Robert Baldwin (Professor of Law at the London School 
of  Economics  specialising  in  regulation).  Finally  defending  freedom  of  expression  was  the 
subject of presentations by John Kampfner (then Chief Executive of Index on Censorship), 
Professor James Curran (Professor of Communications at Goldsmiths, University of London 
and  Chair  of  the  Co-ordinating  Committee  for  Media  Reform)  and  Kelvin  MacKenzie  (a 
columnist for The Sun and the Daily Mail, formerly editor of The Sun and managing director 
of BskyB and Mirror Group Newspapers).

1.22 

It is not necessary to summarise the views expressed either in the presentations or by the 
others who contributed to the seminars. To such extent as they have been incorporated into 
the record of the Inquiry (which, during the course of subsequent evidence, most have), they 
will be reflected in the analysis that follows. What is important to emphasise, however, is that, 
with very limited exception, all the speakers saw and took the opportunity of the seminars to 
analyse where recent events were leading and had led the business, industry or profession of 
journalism; in my view, this did a great deal to open up the issues to a wider audience.

1.23  Without minimising any contribution from any speaker, I particularly mention Mr Dacre who, 
while challenging the justification upon which the Inquiry was set up (including the credentials 
of those participating in it), identifying what he described as paradoxes in the current furore 
over the press and seeking to de-bunk what he called myths surrounding the PCC, went on to 
recognise the need for reform if trust was to be regained and made a number of suggestions 
which openly and emphatically started the debate as to the future. This was a very important 
recognition of the need for change which, coming from an extremely important player in the 

5 Mr Browne was later instructed to act on behalf of Trinity Mirror plc but I am entirely satisfied that his appearance 
at the Seminar was as an expert in the field and not as counsel to a media group that was later to become a Core 
Participant

15

Aindustry, was of enormous value. It is a matter of record that, as he was perfectly entitled to 
do, he later resiled from at least one of the suggestions that he then made.6

1.24  These seminars had another value, which was to allow me to signal (as I have repeated many 
times throughout the Inquiry) that I saw the best solution as one that both the press and the 
public would accept as a realistic approach to the issue of regulation. The recognition that the 
PCC no longer held the confidence of the public (whatever might have been the position in 
the past) was a vital stepping stone to identifying a system that would achieve the legitimate 
aims of the press while, at the same time, satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the public. It 
is obviously important that the system works for the press and that, preferably, it is acceptable 
to them. However, it is even more important – indeed critical – that it works for the public 
in the sense that the public accept that the press are able to pursue legitimate investigative 
journalism that is in the public interest, but, at the same time, can be held to account for abuses 
of the freedoms which they have to pursue stories which have no discernible public interest 
and whether those abuses are criminal, tortuous, or merely contrary to any recognised code 
of legitimate journalistic practice. I believed that the editorial representatives of the press 
appreciated that, if it was accepted that the PCC could no longer continue as it had, this goal 
was a fundamental requirement of the Inquiry.

1.25 

I ought to add that I initially intended to hold further seminars for different aspects of the 
work of the Inquiry.7 In the event, as evidence became available, I decided that the impetus 
which had been the extremely valuable result of the first series of seminars did not require 
repetition. It was sufficient for public understanding of the work of the Inquiry and its direction 
for Counsel, Robert Jay QC, to open each module in turn, explaining precisely what it was 
intended to achieve and the direction that the Inquiry would take. That understanding was 
also aided by the identification and publication of key issues for each of the modules which, 
in turn, generated public response.

Broadcasting

1.26  The fourth preliminary step in relation to the broad approach concerned the extent to which 
it would be appropriate to allow cameras into the Inquiry room to record the evidence and 
thereafter to stream it live onto the Inquiry website. On the one hand, I was conscious that 
it would create pressure on witnesses who wished to protect their privacy and, as a result of 
the presence of a permanent record of their evidence, could serve to undermine that privacy. 
It would also serve to increase the day to day pressure on Counsel and all others participating 
in the work of the Inquiry. On the other hand, I recognised the significant public interest in 
what the Inquiry was doing and seeking to achieve, along with the very real importance in 
ensuring that the evidence was available for all to see in a form that was unmediated by press 
or other reporting. I dealt with my concern in relation to the witnesses who complained of 
press intrusion by ensuring that all who gave oral evidence were volunteers and understood 
that their evidence would be streamed on the website and available to be seen in the future; 
it is for that reason that I particularly recognised the value of their participation when each 
gave evidence.

6 At the third seminar, Mr Dacre said: “While I abhor statutory controls, there’s one area where Parliament can help 
the press. Some way must be found to compel all newspaper owners to fund and participate in self-regulation.” http://
www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/RPC_DOCS1-12374597-v1-PAUL_DACRE_S_SEMINAR_
SPEECH.pdf. That is no longer his position: on 15 June 2012, he submitted: “In retrospect, after hearing some of 
the devastating evidence to the Inquiry in the third module, I regret this suggestion because I now fear that ANY 
parliamentary involvement would be the “thin edge of the wedge” which could result in fuller statutory control of the 
press”: p5, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Submission-by-Paul-Dacre1.pdf

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

1.27 

In the event, I am satisfied that the decision to stream the work of the Inquiry (and to enter 
into appropriate contractual relationships with television broadcasters as to the use to which 
it may be put) was entirely justified. Sky News and the BBC devoted a considerable proportion 
of time to televising the hearings and other media news channels used the footage both on 
television and as part of their online reporting.

1.28  When dealing with the topic of televising the Inquiry, it is important to sound a note of caution. 
I  am  conscious  that  a  number  of  people  have  used  the  valuable  impact  of  the  reporting 
of the Inquiry in support of the argument that all court proceedings should be capable of 
being televised and that the present restrictions contained within s41 of the Criminal Justice 
Act 1925 should be removed. Although the experience of the Inquiry can inform any such 
debate, it is important to provide the context. The press and other professional witnesses 
were subject of notice under s21 of the Inquiries Act 2005 (and so were required to provide 
evidence and, when appropriate, attend the Inquiry). However, as I have said, the witnesses 
who complained about press intrusion were volunteers and understood that their evidence 
would  be  streamed  and  available  on  the  website;  cross  examination  was  limited  or  non-
existent.  In  very  few  cases,  steps  were  taken  to  preserve  anonymity  of  appearance  if  not 
identity. In a criminal trial or family proceedings, civilian witnesses are victims, involved in 
personal  tragedy  or  accidental  (and,  in  many  cases,  reluctant)  participants  in  the  process 
of justice; they can be cross examined at length and, frequently, as to their credit. To film 
their evidence (particularly in high profile cases) would be to subject them to intolerable and 
damaging pressure which would most certainly not be in the interests of justice.

1.29  Returning to the impact of the other preliminary steps that I have outlined, the briefings and 
the seminars had the intended effect. In addition to eliciting responses from those who were 
either invited to provide evidence or, pursuant to notice under s21 of the Inquiries Act 2005, 
were required to do so, many other interested parties and the members of the public did 
engage in the process of the Inquiry.

Core Participants

1.30  Running at the same time as the briefings and seminars, as a fifth preliminary step, it was 
necessary to determine who should be entitled to Core Participant status for any or all of 
the modules of the Inquiry and to decide how the Inquiry should proceed in the light of any 
representations that Core Participants might make. I decided to separate out applications 
for Core Participant status for each of the four modules, on the basis that although many 
interested parties would have equal interest in all aspects of the Inquiry (and so were granted 
on a blanket basis from the outset), a number might only be concerned with fewer aspects of 
the Terms of Reference. In the circumstances, I invited applications for each of the modules 
and dealt with them on that basis. Although deadlines for such applications passed, in the 

17

Amain, I considered each, whenever it was made, on its merits and ruled in accordance with 
the letter and spirit of Rule 5(2) of the Inquiry Rules 2006.8

The approach to evidence

1.31  The sixth, and final, preliminary issue concerned the steps that I should take, while seeking 
to obtain a narrative of facts, to ensure that I did not prejudice any criminal investigation or 
potential prosecution and, at the same time, maintain a balanced and fair approach to others 
said to have been involved in illegal or unethical methods of gathering stories. In relation 
to the former, having invited submissions at an early stage (in particular from the Director 
of Public Prosecutions and the police), I ruled on the appropriate approach to evidence in 
relation  to  those  charged  with  criminal  offences  or  under  investigation.  My  conclusion  is 
summarised at para 1.16 above.9 Fairness (as required by s17(3) of the Inquiries Act 2005) 
has, however, taken me further for I have not felt it appropriate to protect the names of those 
who have been arrested from being linked to specific allegations of criminal conduct, while 
affording no such protection for those alleged to have been involved in other criminal (or, in 
some cases, unethical) conduct which is not being investigated (and therefore gives rise to no 
risk of prejudice).

1.32  This approach has been criticised by those who wish to expose what is said to be the greater 
criminality revealed by a study of the documents seized by the Information Commissioner 
during Operation Motorman (the arrest of a private detective, Steve Whittamore), involving 
a very much greater section of the press than those seized by the police during Operation 
Caryatid (the arrest of Glenn Mulcaire, now being revisited in Operation Weeting). However, 
it is entirely consistent with the fact that the Terms of Reference are divided into two parts 
and that this first Part concerns the culture, practices and ethics of the press rather than 
individual conduct. Throughout the Inquiry, there are references to what I have described 
as the ‘mantra’ that I have not presently been concerned with ‘who did what to whom’ but 
culture practices and ethics. To the mantra, I have added what I have called the ‘self-denying 
ordinance’  that,  although  the  Inquiry  has  investigated  with  individual  journalists  conduct 
which is not the subject (or likely to be the subject) of police inquiries, so that the question of 
self incrimination does not arise, in the main, I have extended similar protection to individual 
journalists and others who are not currently the subject of any investigations.10 This approach 
has not been inflexible because it has been critically important to ensure that an appropriate

narrative  of  fact  is  available,  against  which  to  judge  the  efficacy  of  the  present  system  of 
self regulation promulgated through the Press Complaints Commission and any proposals to 
amend or replace that system.

I can illustrate this necessary inhibition on what I have been able to do with a simple example. 
In his first statement to the Inquiry, the editor of The Times, James Harding, made a passing 
reference to a single instance of computer hacking. This was not investigated further at that 
time but, in a masterly analysis, David Allan Green linked the reference to the exposure of a 
blogger known as Nightjack. That led to a letter and a further statement from Mr Harding which 
resulted in his being recalled to give evidence. Because the Nightjack incident had been the 
subject of litigation, the then legal manager of The Times, Mr Alastair Brett, appeared at the 
Inquiry when the matter was analysed in some detail. On the basis of this evidence, it would 
certainly be possible to draw a number of important conclusions about what happened at 
The Times and about internal governance and legal risk management. However, because the 
journalist who was said to be at the centre of this incident has now been arrested for offences 
of computer hacking and attempting to pervert the course of justice, it is not appropriate to 
risk prejudice to that investigation or to any possible trial by further discussing it.

1.34  A  further  consequence  of  this  has  been  the  need  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  inferential 
criticism of those who are currently the subject of criminal investigations. So, for example, 
a criticism of the governance arrangements at a particular newspaper, whether in general 
terms or directed at particular members of the management team, could, by implication, 
be interpreted as a criticism of others, elsewhere within the organisation. The requirement 
on me to tread this careful path might mean that some readers of this Report are surprised 
that a number of senior executives who gave evidence are not subject to the criticisms that 
might otherwise have been expected or, at least, discussed. It is, however, the consequence 
of the imperative not to or cause substantial prejudice to the investigation or prosecution of 
allegations of crime.

2.	 The	gathering	and	presentation	of	evidence

2.1 

Module One
As  I  have  explained,  many  public  inquiries  follow  some  incident  or  event  which  has 
immediately been the subject of police or other investigation, so that the product of that 
investigation will be able to form the basis body of evidence upon which the inquiry can rely 
for its facts. In the case of this Inquiry, however, although aspects of the Terms of Reference 
had been or were the subject of litigation,11 the police investigation was ongoing. Although 
the Inquiry obtained evidence both from the civil and public law actions, the collection of 
evidence even for Module One (the press and the public) required trawling from a very wide 
range of people including (a) individuals who complained that they have been the subject 
of press criminality or intrusion (one of whom gave evidence with the benefit of complete 

11 This includes the civil actions of Gordon Taylor and Sienna Miller which were of critical importance to the greater 
understanding of the truth behind the assertion of ‘one rogue reporter’, the many civil actions conducted before Vos J 
and the public law review of the conduct of the Metropolitan Police in relation to Operation Caryatid

19

A2.2 

anonymity),12 (b) newspaper proprietors, editors, journalists13 and support staff (including, in 
relation to News International, external lawyers), (c) freelance journalists, campaign groups 
and  others  who  have  been  concerned  about  press  conduct,  (d)  photographers  (including 
paparazzi) and private detectives, (e) mobile phone operators, (f) the police and Director of 
Public Prosecutions, (g) the Information Commissioner and his staff, (h) the Press Complaints 
Commission,  (i)  academic  journalists  and  (j)  bloggers  and  internet  sites.  The  remaining 
modules  required  different  groups  of  people  or  different  individuals  within  the  relevant 
organisations.

Section 21(2) of the Inquiries Act 2005 provides that I could require any person, within such 
period as appears to be reasonable to provide evidence in the form of a written statement 
(including documents). For each module, save in relation to those who complained about 
press intrusion (whom I considered ought to have the opportunity to decline to give evidence 
in public about their complaints of invasions of privacy) and a number of the most senior 
politicians, I decided that all witnesses would be required pursuant to the Act to assist me: 
this was not intended to reflect a concern that witnesses would not be prepared to volunteer 
their assistance (as, I believe almost without exception, all were) but rather to ensure that 
there was a consistency of approach across all those whom the Inquiry approached. Such 
requests could only be made after the Inquiry had formally commenced (at the end of July 
2011) and it was obviously essential to give everyone to whom requests for evidence had 
been addressed sufficient time to submit considered evidence. Given the summer, this meant 
that  most  of  the  evidence  was  not,  in  fact,  available  until  the  autumn.  It  then  had  to  be 
assimilated and, eventually, made available to Core Participants for any comment prior to it 
being called.

2.3 

In  addition  to  witnesses  whom  the  Inquiry  approached,  an  invitation  was  posted  on  the 
website inviting members of the public and other interested individuals or groups to submit 
evidence directly to the Inquiry.14 It is worth setting out the key questions posed which were 
as follows:

“The Inquiry is currently looking at the relationship between the press and the public. 
We’re interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and 
examples in response to the specific questions below.
Your answers may be considered as potential evidence to the inquiry.

1.  The  Inquiry  needs  to  understand  how  newsrooms  operate,  particularly  in  the 
tabloid  and  mid-market  sectors.  Can  you  provide  a  personal  account  of  culture, 
practices and ethics in any part of the press and media?

12 http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/231111-S19-restriction-order-HJK.pdf
13 This evidence included hearsay, anonymous material which Michelle Stanistreet the General Secretary of the 
National Union of Journalists sought to adduce from a number of journalists who feared for their careers if they spoke 
out in public. An application for this evidence to be heard was challenged by other Core Participants and subject 
to ‘gateway’ rulings by the Inquiry: http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Anonymous-

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

2.  Seminar debates have suggested that commercial pressures were not new, were 
not  unique  to  the  press,  and  did  not  impact  adversely  on  standards  of  journalism 
or  ethical  behaviour.  The  Inquiry  would  be  interested  in  submissions  on  this,  with 
examples where possible.
3.  Some seminar attendees suggest reader loyalty limits competition between titles. 
Professional competition to be first or best with a story, though, could be a powerful 
force.  Other  participants  suggested  some  papers  put  journalists  under  significant 
pressure to produce a story within a tight timeframe. The Inquiry would be interested 
in experiences of the competitive dynamics in journalism and how that impacts on 
the way in which journalists operate, with examples where possible.
4.  With the advent of the internet and 24 hour news as well as declines in revenue 
and circulation, we have heard that fewer journalists are having to do more work. 
The seminars also raised the issue of the casualisation of the workforce. The inquiry 
would  be  interested  in  experiences  of  how  this  may  have  changed  the  culture  in 
newsrooms and what it might mean in terms of journalistic practice, with examples 
where possible.
5.  The issue of stories that attract a high degree of press attention but subsequently 
turn out to be false was raised at the seminars. The Inquiry would be interested in 
submissions from editors, reporters and subjects of such stories - why they occur (what 
are the pressures that drive press interest), and how they occur (what checks and 
balances are or should be in place to stop this happening and why do they sometimes 
not operate)?
6.  One  seminar  attendee  suggested  that  the  National  Council  for  the  Training  of 
Journalists does not teach ethics. The Inquiry would be interested in experience of 
how ethics are taught and promulgated amongst journalists.

Standards
7.  Attendees proposed that the general law, as it applies to everyone, should be the 
only constraint on the press. The inquiry would welcome submissions on whether, 
and if so why, the press should be subject to any additional constraints in relation to 
behaviour and standards, for example relating to accuracy, treatment of vulnerable 
individuals,  intrusion,  financial  reporting  or  reporting  on  crime,  other  than  those 
imposed by existing laws.
8.  Editors at the seminars argued that the Editors’ Code was a good set of standards 
to work to. The Inquiry would be interested in submissions from all parties on the 
coverage and substance of the Editors’ code including accuracy and redress for those 
who are affected by breaches of the code.
9.  It has been argued that the statutory regulation and impartiality requirements that 
apply to broadcasting do not chill investigative reporting on television. Broadcasters 
are able to rely on the printed press to break controversial stories and then follow 
on  behind.  The  inquiry  would  be  interested  in  submissions  on  the  extent  to  which 
the  regulatory  regime  for  broadcasting  casts  a  chill  on  broadcast  reporting  and 
the relationship between the printed press and broadcast media as a result of the 
different regulatory environments.

Public interest
10.  The Inquiry has heard strong arguments for the importance of a free press in a 
democratic society. The Inquiry would be interested in submissions on the special role 
to be played by the press in a democracy, what ‘freedom’ requirements need to be 

21

Ain place for that role to be played and the whether this role places any obligations or 
responsibilities on the press.
11.  We’ve  heard  arguments  that  sometimes  it  will  be  in  the  public  interest  for 
journalists and media organisations to do things that would otherwise be ethically or 
legally questionable. The inquiry would be interested in submissions on the extent to 
which, if at all, should acting in the public interest be a complete or partial defence 
in relation to unlawful or unethical activity in pursuit of journalism; and, if so, subject 
to what conditions.
12.  In  practice  any  public  interest  argument  would  need  to  be  considered  in  the 
context  of  specific  cases.  The  Inquiry  would  be  interested  in  submissions  on  who 
should be responsible for reaching decisions on whether something is in the public 
interest, and on what basis.
Illustrative examples would be helpful.”

2.4 

2.5 

It has been suggested that the Inquiry never engaged with the public, and therefore never 
engaged with those who purchase tabloid or mid-market papers, with the result that the 
evidence has been in some sense skewed or biased against the millions who read that type of 
paper. In fact, as discussed below, members of the public (with different interests in the work 
of the Inquiry) did respond to this invitation and it proved an extremely valuable resource for 
material which the Inquiry would not otherwise have obtained. Further, a number of witnesses 
and groups who availed themselves of the opportunity to provide views and material were 
later invited to attend to give evidence orally so as to develop the issues which had been 
raised. As for the risk that only those with some criticism of the press might respond, as the 
questions make clear, the Inquiry was equally anxious to hear in support of the press as in 
criticism of it.

The briefings, seminars, and the collection, examination and distillation of the evidence meant 
that it was not possible to start the formal hearings of the Inquiry until Monday 14 November 
2011,  when  Robert  Jay  QC  made  an  opening  statement,  followed  by  opening  statements 
from the Core Participants. Witness evidence commenced on Monday 21 November 2011 
and, for Module One, continued until 9 February 2012: 175 witnesses gave evidence over 
a period of 40 days and the evidence of further witnesses was read into the record of the 
Inquiry  not  only  while  Module  One  was  ongoing  but  also,  as  it  emerged,  throughout  the 
Inquiry and, where appropriate, even after the formal hearings had concluded. This latter 
process has given rise to misunderstanding which I have frequently sought to correct during 
the course of the Inquiry but which it is appropriate to make very clear.

2.6  While the evidence on Module 1 was proceeding, a number of submissions were received 
from campaigning groups who argued that the approach of the PCC to third party complaints 
was such that there was no avenue for redress in the absence of a identified ‘victim’ who 
was prepared to pursue a complaint on his or her own behalf. In particular, therefore, generic 
complaints (of misleading and inaccurate reporting of issues such as immigration, domestic 
violence and others) were unchallengeable. This was not simply a complaint about tone or 
balance (although there were such concerns as well) because it was well understood that 
newspapers, unlike broadcasters, were perfectly entitled to be partisan in their views. Rather, 
it was to do with factual accuracy and consequent comment. To that end, arrangements were 
made  for  evidence  to  be  given  from,  among  others,  Inayat  Bunglawala  (Engage),  Heather 
Harvey  (Eaves  Housing  for  Women),  Anna  Van  Heeswijk  (OBJECT),  Jacqui  Hunt  (Equality 
Now), Marai Larasi (End Violence against Women) and Helen Belcher (Transmedia Watch). 
As  explained  by  Fiona  Fox  (Science  Media  Centre)  misleading  and  inaccurate  reporting  of

2.8 

conceptual issues (such as climate change or science generally) were similarly not covered by 
the complaints system.

Submissions from different groups continued to be received covering other areas of extremely 
important  social  awareness;  these  included,  among  others,  submissions  concerning  the 
treatment afforded by the press to the young, the mentally ill, the disabled and other groups 
in society, some of which were vulnerable and others the particular subject of press concern.15 
All make the same or similar points to those which the Inquiry had already heard, albeit from 
the different perspective of the particular concern of that specific campaign. Quite apart from 
the question of the available time (given the very wide-ranging Terms of Reference and the 
other evidence that it was essential to capture), the question arose whether it was necessary 
to call this evidence orally in order to make the points that were developed in writing.

In the event, I decided that it was not necessary to call more evidence; however, arrangements 
were made for each of these submissions (as with all other evidence read into the Inquiry) 
to  be  circulated  to  Core  Participants  so  that  if  any  advanced  a  reason  why  the  evidence 
should not received into the record of the Inquiry, that argument could be considered. In 
the event, no objection was received and all this evidence was ‘read into’ the Inquiry record. 
That means that it is published as part of the evidence of the Inquiry: I have read it and, 
where appropriate, included references to parts of it in this Report. What I am very anxious 
to emphasise, however, is that I do not consider that any of this evidence was ‘second class’ 
or to be accorded a lesser status to the evidence that was adduced orally: it has all been 
important and it has all been considered. The same can be said of the submissions to the 
Inquiry  made  by  others  (not  necessarily  relating  to  campaigning  groups  concerned  with 
third party complaints) which, having also been read into the record, has become part of the 
evidence in the Inquiry.

2.9 

2.10 

As I deal with evidence that was read into the record but not called before me, I ought also to 
deal with complaints that were made to the Inquiry that were not adduced as evidence, not 
because they were not relevant to the Terms of Reference but, rather, because they were both 
complex and highly fact-sensitive. This would have resulted in a considerable amount of time 
being  devoted  to  investigating  the  circumstances,  without  there  being  any  corresponding 
value to be derived as to the generic culture, practices and ethics of the press (rather than 
the behaviour of those titles involved in the particular facts being examined). One example 
will suffice.

In March 1997, a private investigator, Daniel Morgan was murdered in South East London. 
There have been five police inquiries into the circumstances of his death and it has been 
alleged that his partner, Jonathan Rees, might have been involved in his murder (he was later 
acquitted when the prosecution were unable to guarantee his right to a fair trial following the 
discovery by the police of four undisclosed crates of material). Mr Rees had been employed 
by the NoTW and, the nature of the relationship has been the subject of media comment. I 
can well understand why Mr Morgan’s family saw the Inquiry as an opportunity to uncover 
information  about  his  death  (and  Mr  Rees  clearly  visualised  that  possibility  because  he

Whether there should be an inquiry into this particular case is not for me to say: it is sufficient 
if I repeat the explanation that to have examined the issues arising would have taken weeks 
or months and I did not consider that the very limited time available for this Inquiry was 
best deployed in that way. In the event, although I made it clear that Mr Rees could make a 
statement for the Inquiry, he has not done so.16

Module Two

2.11  That  conveniently  brings  me  to  Module  Two  which  started  on  27  February  2012.  The 
evidence touching the relationship between the press and the police had been obtained and 
assimilated while Module One was proceeding. Once again, key questions for this module 
were also published on the website17 which, again, generated considerable public interest. 
The questions (which provide a good overview of some of the issues which the Inquiry was to 
consider in this module) were as follows:

“The Inquiry is now looking at the relationship between the press and the police.
We’re interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and 
examples in response to the specific questions below. Your answers may be considered 
as potential evidence to the Inquiry and may be published in a redacted form as part 
of the Inquiry’s evidence.

Culture, practices and ethics:
1.  The Inquiry needs to understand how the relationship between the press and the 
police currently operates. The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of police 
officers,  other  police  staff,  and  journalists  as  to  how  the  relationship  between  the 
press and the police works in practice.
2.  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of police officers, other police 
staff, and journalists as to how the current Police Service policies and guidance in 
place to regulate the relationship between the press and the police work in practice.
3.  The Inquiry would like to build up an overall picture of the nature and level of 
the interaction that currently exists between the police and the press. The Inquiry 
would therefore be interested to receive submissions on the type and frequency of 
contact  which  currently  exists  between  police  officers,  other  police  staff,  and  the 
media  (differentiating  between  local  and  national  media  contact),  with  examples 
where possible.
4.  The  internet,  24  hour  news  and  social  media  has  brought  new  challenges  for 
both the police and the press. The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of 
police officers, other police staff, and journalists on how this may have altered the 
relationship, and whether the Police Service policies and guidance in place have kept 
pace with this changing environment, with examples where possible.
5.  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views on the level of awareness and 
experience  that  exists  within  the  Police  Service  of  “media  crime”  (the  unlawful 
interception of communications, bribery of officials by the media and harassment by 
paparazzi and journalists, for example), with examples where possible.

16 Other examples are discussed in the ruling concerning the evidence of Peter Tickner: see http://www.levesoninquiry.

24

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

6.  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether the Police Service 
governance arrangements, policies and guidance currently in place are sufficient to 
sustain a transparent and ethical relationship between the police and the press which 
at the same time upholds the confidentiality and rights of the victims of crime and the 
public more generally.
7.  The  Inquiry  would  be  interested  to  receive  submissions  on  what  Police  Service 
training, governance and oversight arrangements exist, and views on whether it is 
sufficient, to ensure that acceptable boundaries exist between the police and press, 
with examples where possible.
8.  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of journalists about whether 
you have ever felt under any pressure not to report a story involving a police officer 
or member of police staff (detailing where and from whom the pressure came), with 
examples where possible.
9.  The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions from police officers, other 
police staff, and journalists on the extent to which formal and informal interaction 
between the press and the police is recorded for the purposes of transparency (are 
such  records  audited,  and  if  so  by  whom,  for  example).  Information  control  and 
disclosure:
10.  The Inquiry would be interested to receive submissions on the extent to which 
systems are in place (and an assessment of whether they are adequate) to identify, 
prevent, manage and investigate police data leaks and breaches.
11.  The Inquiry would be interested in the experiences of the victims of crime and 
the public more generally, who feel that they have been adversely affected (perhaps 
through a data leak or breach, or through the reporting of a case) by the current 
relationship between the press and the police, with examples where possible. The 
Inquiry would also be interested to receive submissions in relation to this issue on 
whether it is felt that the current investigation and complaint regime are adequate to 
properly address instances of this type.
12.  The Inquiry would welcome submissions on how the police and the media working 
together is and can be of benefit to the public, with examples where possible.

Professional Standards:
13.  The  Inquiry  would  like  to  receive  views  as  to  whether  it  is  felt  that  adequate 
governance  and  oversight  arrangements  are  in  place  for  police  officers  and  other 
police staff to ensure the effective management and recording of gifts and hospitality, 
secondary business interests, associations and conflicts of interest.
14.  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to what type of payments, 
gifts  or  hospitality  (if  any)  you  consider  to  be  legitimate  transactions  between 
police officers, other police staff, and the media, and is and should the approach to 
payments, gifts or hospitality between the press and the police be different to the 
approach between the police and other parties.
15.  The Inquiry would be interested to receive views as to whether there should be 
rules in place to govern how and when police officers and other police staff leaving 
the Police Service can take up posts with the media, commercial or other bodies, with 
examples of when such a move has been problematic or brought advantages where 
possible.

rules in place to govern how and when members of the press, or the media more 
generally, can take up posts with the Police Service, with examples of when such a 
move has been problematic or brought advantages where possible.”

2.12  At a more specific level, Module Two covered a number of different topics. First, it involved 
a  consideration  of  Operation  Caryatid  from  its  inception,  following  a  complaint  by  the 
Royal  Household  in  relation  to  the  interception  of  mobile  phone  messages,  through  to 
the  commencement  and  impact  of  Operations  Weeting,  Elveden  and  Tuleta.  To  that  end 
a  number  of  police  officers  gave  evidence,  along  with  the  relevant  Directors  of  Public 
Prosecutions and leading counsel instructed in the prosecution of Clive Goodman and Glenn 
Mulcaire. Second, it concerned the more general relationship over many years between the 
press and the MPS, thereby involving witnesses who complained about the impact of that 
relationship upon themselves; the last four Commissioners and the present Commissioner 
of the MPS, together with many very senior officers and ex officers and personnel from the 
Department of Public Affairs; and journalists who had considered the relationship and crime 
journalists who depended upon it. Third, evidence of comparison with other regional police 
forces and the regional press was called both from Chief Constables, other ranks and press 
departments, as was evidence of the approach of the Association of Chief Police Officers. 
Fourth, reports prepared by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary (Sir Denis O’Connor) and, 
for the Commissioner of the MPS (by Elizabeth Filkin), and the views of police authorities 
(including  the  relevant  regulator  for  the  MPS,  the  Mayor’s  Office  for  Policing  and  Crime) 
also fell to be considered. This evidence broadly concluded on 4 April 2012, with the Inquiry 
having heard from 93 witnesses over 23 days.

2.13  As I have indicated above, the evidence of a number of witnesses covered all four modules. 
That  was  particularly  so  in  relation  to  Rupert  Murdoch,  James  Murdoch,  the  proprietors 
of other newspaper groups and a number of senior staff from News Corporation or News 
International. This group of seven witnesses gave evidence (over two weeks in April and May 
2012) between Module Two concerning the press and the police and Module 3 concerning 
the press and politicians.

Module Three

2.14  Module Three formally opened on 10 May 2012 and involved evidence over a period in excess 
of four weeks from 44 witnesses. These included some of the most senior politicians of the 
last 20 years (including the present and last three Prime Ministers, the Deputy Prime Minister, 
the Leader of the Opposition and the First Minister of Scotland), senior civil servants, special 
advisers and political journalists. The primary concern was the relationship between politicians 
of all political hues and the press, together with the impact (whether in reality or as a matter 
of  perception)  of  such  relationships  as  existed  on  the  development  and  implementation 
of policy concerning the press. Political challenges came to the fore, however, in particular 
concerns about the handling by the present Government of the bid by News Corporation for 
those shares in BSkyB Ltd which were not already owned or controlled by Rupert Murdoch. 
Although only one of a number of issues regarding the relationship between politicians and 
the proprietors and editors of mass market newspapers over the last 30 years, the questions 
that arose (being of contemporary political concern) came to dominate aspects of the Inquiry. 
There  was  particular  interest  in  an  issue  arising  from  Parliamentary  Questions  addressed 
to the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, which were the subject 

26

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

of  a  detailed  account  in  his  statement  to  the  Inquiry.18  In  the  event,  these  Parliamentary 
Questions were not then pursued in the House of Commons; they were examined, at some 
length, when Jeremy Hunt MP gave evidence.19 This module continued until 14 June 2012, 
although aspects were further examined on 25-26 June.

2.15  As with the first two modules, key questions regarding the relationship between the press 
and politicians were identified and placed on the website20 for consideration and comment 
by any interested group or member of the public. Again, it provides useful context for the 
work of the Inquiry to set these questions out at this stage:

“The Inquiry is now looking at the relationship between the press and politicians.
We are interested in hearing from professionals and the public with information and 
examples in response to the specific questions below. Your answers may be considered 
as potential evidence to the Inquiry and may be published in a redacted form as part 
of the Inquiry’s evidence.
1.  The Inquiry is interested in the extent of public knowledge and understanding of 
the relationship between the media and the politicians. Where does that knowledge 
come from? How is it tested? What use is made of publicly available information (for 
example about meetings between senior politicians and leading media figures)? Has 
the change to the Ministerial Code in July 2011 made a difference? (The Code now 
states: “the Government will be open about its links with the media. All meetings 
with newspaper and other media proprietors, editors and senior executives will be 
published quarterly, regardless of the purpose of the meeting”.)
2.  The Inquiry would like to hear views on the specific benefits and risks to the public 
interest  arising  from  relationships  between  senior  politicians,  at  a  national  level, 
and  the  media.  What  does  the  public  stand  to  gain  from  this  relationship?  What 
does it stand to lose? How can the gains be maximised and the risks minimised? Are 
there specific considerations the Inquiry should be aware of in the run up to general 
elections and other national polls?
3.  The Inquiry is interested in hearings views on the conditions that are necessary for 
a free press in a democracy to fulfil its role in holding politicians and the powerful to 
account. What is the nature of that role? What is the public entitled to expect of the 
press in fulfilling it? How can the public see for itself that the press is taking this role 
seriously and going about it responsibly? Are there some good examples?
4.  Is there a perception that political journalism generally has moved from reporting, 
to seeking to make or influence political events? How far is there evidence for that, 
and should it be a matter of public concern or not? Does the press have a legitimate 
function in fulfilling a political Opposition role?
5.  The Inquiry is interested in the nature of media influence on public policy in general 
(for example in areas such as criminal justice, immigration or European policy). Do 
you have views, or any specific examples, about how that influence is exercised and 
with what effect? How transparent is the process? Is the public well served by it?

Hearing-15-May-2012.pdf
19 One of the issues that arose in the House of Commons concerned the allegation that Mr Hunt had breached the 
terms of the Ministerial Code. As I have made consistently clear, my approach has been focussed on the relationship 
between the press and politicians and the conduct of each as a matter of generality; it is no part of my intention or 
my function to pass judgment on anything else and, in particular, I have not addressed the political (still less the party 
political) questions that have been asked

27

A6.  The Inquiry is particularly interested in the influence of the media in the content 
and timing of a party’s media policies, and in a Government decision-making on policy 
or operational issues directly affecting the media. Do you have any personal examples 
of how this works in practice? Are the media effective lobbyists in their own causes? 
Do any risks arise from the Government’s role in the determination of takeovers and/
or mergers of media organisations? Is there a need for additional safeguards or limits 
on such involvement?
7.  Is there a need for plurality of voice in news providers within the press, in providers 
of other types of news media or across the media as a whole? How does access to 
news information through the internet affect the need for plurality? What level of 
plurality is required? Is plurality of ownership a sufficient proxy for plurality of voice?
8.  Is there evidence of media influence on public and political appointments (including 
the  tenure  and  termination  of  those  appointments)?  The  Inquiry  is  interested  in 
examples, including of cases where the public interest was, and was not, well served 
by such influence.
9.  How far do you think politicians feel inhibited from acting in the public interest 
to ensure that the media’s conduct, practices and ethics are themselves in the public 
interest? Why might that be? What would make a difference?”

Module Four

2.16  Module  Four  commenced  on  9  July  2012  and  the  Inquiry  heard  from  30  witnesses.  This 
module was initially described as involving a discussion of ‘emerging findings’. In the event, 
it was clear that the Press Board of Finance (PressBoF) and the current chair of the PCC had 
embarked  upon  the  process  of  re-casting  self-regulation;  this  Module  therefore  consisted 
of  a  detailed  examination  not  only  of  that  model  but  also  a  substantial  number  of  other 
models for the regulation of the press that had been submitted as evidence to the Inquiry. 
To encourage that process and assist those devising potential solutions to the problems of 
press regulation, the Inquiry published  Draft Criteria for an Effective Regulatory Regime.21 
These were not intended to be definitive but merely illustrative of the issues that had to be 
addressed. These criteria were as follows:

“In module 4 the Inquiry will hear proposals for potential press regulatory solutions. 
There are three aspects to the question of what regulatory regime should apply to 
the press in the future: firstly what a regulatory regime should do; secondly how it 
should be structured to achieve that; and thirdly the detailed rules that are put in 
place to achieve the objectives. The ‘what’ is about outcomes and the ‘how’ is about 
processes, structures and accountabilities. The detailed rules would be dealt with in 
the substance of any code or regulations. These three aspects of a regulatory regime 
need to be considered separately as they are not necessarily dependent on each other 
and it may be possible to achieve the desired objectives by different combinations of 
solutions.
The Inquiry has already heard a number of suggestions in relation to the ‘how’ and 
the purpose of module 4 is to look at those suggestions in more detail. In order to 
facilitate the scrutiny of the ‘how’ proposals it is necessary to understand ‘what’ any 
regulatory solution is seeking to achieve. The draft criteria for a regulatory solution 
below set out the criteria against which the Inquiry proposes to measure potential 
regulatory solutions. The Inquiry would welcome comments on these criteria.

21 http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Draft-Criteria-for-a-Regulatory-Solution.pdf

28

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

Draft Criteria for a Regulatory Solution
1.  Effectiveness
1.1  Any solution must be perceived as effective and credible both by the press as an 
industry and by the public:

(a) It must strike a balance, capable of being accepted as reasonable, legitimate 

and in the public interest by all.

(b) It must recognise the importance for the public interest of a free press in a 
democracy, freedom of expression and investigative journalism, the rule of law, 
personal privacy and other private rights, and a press which acts responsibly 
and in the public interest.

(c)  It must promote a clear understanding of ‘the public interest’ which would be 

accepted as reasonable by press, industry and public alike.

(d) It  must  be  durable  and  sufficiently  flexible  to  work  for  future  markets  and 

technology, and be capable of universal application.

2.  Fairness and objectivity of Standards
2.1  There must be a statement of ethical standards which is recognised as reasonable 
by the industry and credible by the public. This statement must identify enforceable 
minimum standards as well as articulating good practice that should be aimed for.
2.2  All  standards  for  good  practice  in  journalism  should  be  driven  by  the  public 
interest and must be benchmarked in a clear objective way to the public interest.
2.3  The setting of standards must be independent of government and parliament, 
and sufficiently independent of media interests, in order to command public respect.

3.  Independence and transparency of enforcement and compliance
3.1  Enforcement of ethical standards, by whatever mechanism, must be operationally 
independent of government and parliament, and sufficiently independent of media 
interests, in order to command public respect.
3.2  In particular all relevant appointments processes must be sufficiently independent 
of government, Parliament and media interests to command public support.
3.3  Compliance  must  be  the  responsibility  of  editors  and  transparent  and 
demonstrable to the public.

4.  Powers and remedies
4.1  The  system  must  provide  credible  remedies,  both  in  respect  of  aggrieved 
individuals and in respect of issues affecting wider groups in society.
4.2  The regulatory regime must have effective investigatory and advisory powers.
4.3  The system should also actively support and promote compliance by the industry, 
both  directly  (for  example  by  providing  confidential  pre-publication  advice)  and 
indirectly (for example by kitemarking titles’ own internal systems).
4.4  The  system  should  be  a  good  fit  with  other  relevant  regulatory  and  law 
enforcement functions.

29

A5.  Cost
5.1  The  solution  must  be  sufficiently  reliably  financed  to  allow  for  reasonable 
operational 
independence  and  appropriate  scope,  but  without  placing  a 
disproportionate burden on either the industry, complainants or the taxpayer.”

2.17  Quite apart from the regulatory solution, Module Four also dealt with other key questions 
and,  to  that  end,  involved  evidence  from  experts  in  diverse  fields  ranging  from  differing 
approaches to press regulation across the word (and, in particular, the Irish model) to data 
protection,  from  ethics  and  philosophy  to  plurality.  The  key  questions,  reflecting  some  of 
these issues, were published on the website22 and, again, interested parties and the public 
were invited to submit evidence which could be considered during the course of the evidence 
(even  if  only  to  prompt  questions  from  Counsel  to  the  Inquiry).  These  questions  were  as 
follows:

“Relevant aspects of the public interest
1.  How would you describe the public interest in a free press?
2.  How would you describe the public  interest in freedom of expression?  To what 
extent does that public interest coincide with, or diverge from, the public interest in 
a free press?
3.  In order to maximise the overall public interest, with what other aspects of the 
public  interest  would  freedom  of  expression,  or  freedom  of  the  press,  have  to  be 
balanced or limited? The Inquiry is particularly interested in the following, but there 
may be others:

(a) the interest of the public as a whole in good political governance, for example 

in areas such as
–  national security, public order and economic wellbeing,
–  the  rule  of  law,  the  proper  independence  and  accountability  of  law 

enforcement agencies, and access to justice, and

–  the  democratic  accountability  of  government  for  the  formation  and 

implementation of policy;

(b) the  public  interest  in  individual  self-determination  and  the  protection  and 

enforcement of private interests, for example
–  privacy,  including  (but  not  necessarily  limited  to)  the  rights  to  privacy 
specified  in  general  in  Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human 
Rights  and  in  European  and  national  legislation  on  the  protection  of 
personal data,

–  confidentiality,  the  protection  of  reputation,  and  intellectual  and  other 

– 

property rights, and
individual  freedom  of  expression  and  rights  to  receive  and  impart 
information  where  those  interests  and  rights  are  not  identical  to  the 
interests and rights of the press.

4.  What are your views on the extent to which the overall public interest is currently 
well served, both in principle and in practice, by the current balance between the 
public  interest  in  the  freedom  of  the  press  and  free  expression  on  the  one  hand, 
and  competing  aspects  of  the  public  interest  on  the  other?  In  your  opinion,  what 

22 http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Key-Questions-Module-4.pdf

30

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

changes if any would be desirable in this respect, in order to maximise the overall 
public interest? If relevant, please state whether those changes should be voluntary 
or obligatory.

Press ethics
5.  What would be the distinguishing features of the conduct and practices of a media 
industry, or any organisation which was a part of that industry, which would make it 
an ‘ethical’ one?
6.  In particular, to whom might the press be considered to owe ethical duties, and 
why? What might be the content of such duties? To what extent might such duties 
come  into  conflict,  and  how  should  any  such  conflicts  be  resolved?  The  Inquiry  is 
particularly interested in the following as potentially owed ethical duties, but there 
may be others:

(a) readers and consumers of the media
(b) persons who are the subject matter of stories and other media products
(c)  the wider public
(d) employees, journalists and other producers of the media
(e) shareholders, investors, advertisers and others with an economic interest in 

the media.

7.  What  role  might  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  played  by  a  code  of  conduct  in 
encouraging, inculcating or enforcing ethical behaviour by the press? What would 
be  the  distinguishing  principles  and  features  of  any  code  of  ethical  conduct  with 
universal application to the media industry?
8.  To what extent does the media industry’s Code of Practice (http://www.pcc.org.
uk/cop/practice.html) meet the needs of an ethical code?
9.  What approach would you recommend to the consideration of improvement to 
the nature, status, content and enforceability of the current Code? Are there changes 
to either content or enforceability of the current Code you would wish to see? Please 
explain your thinking.
10.  What  other  changes  would  you  consider  desirable  in  order  to  encourage  or 
constrain  the  press  to  improved  standards  of  ethical  conduct  and  practice?  Your 
answer  should  explain  the  standards  you  consider  appropriate  and  why,  whether 
conformity should be encouraged or constrained, and how.”

3.	 Challenging	the	evidence
3.1 

Litigation in this country is generally conducted by way of adversarial process. In other words, 
subject to the over-riding control of the court, the parties to the litigation define the issues 
and the evidence to be adduced, each side disclosing the evidence on which it is intended to 
rely and calling such witnesses as it feels necessary to prove its case. Witnesses called by one 
side are cross-examined by the other side or sides, challenging evidence which is disputed and 
‘putting’ the case which is to be advanced so that the witness can deal with the allegations 
made against him or her. The role of the judge or tribunal is to stand in the middle of the 
exercise, intervening in the evidence to elucidate or seek explanation and then listen to the 
opposing arguments of the parties both as to the facts and the law, before ultimately deciding 
the issues at stake. Inquisitorial proceedings (more common in civil law than common law 
jurisdictions) are led by the judge or tribunal and involve active participation the investigation 

31

Aof the facts. There will still be an important role for the legal representatives of the parties to 
ensure that their ‘case’ is fully considered.

3.2 

The purpose of an Inquiry is not to resolve issues between parties to litigation; there are no 
parties and there is no litigation in place. On more than one occasion, it has appeared that 
at least one Core Participant has treated itself as if in adversarial litigation with the Inquiry 
but that is to misunderstand both the Inquiry and the role of those who participate in it. 
The role of the Core Participants has been to assist the Inquiry in the elucidation of the facts 
which form the substratum of the Terms of Reference and then to make submissions on the 
way forward. The point was made in specific connection to this Inquiry by Lord Justice Moses 
in the first of the challenges by Elaine Decoulos to my failure to grant her Core Participant 
status. He said [2011] EWHC 3214 (Admin) at para 5:

“The  purpose  of  the  Inquiry  is  not  to  vindicate  individuals’  sufferings  or  claims 
they may have due to mistreatment by the press, but rather for all of us as citizens 
concerned at the relations between the press, institutions and the public.”

3.3 

The role of Core Participants is, therefore, totally different to that of the parties to litigation 
and very much more constrained than the role that might be adopted even in inquisitorial 
proceedings which are directed to dealing with individual complaints or claims. Furthermore, 
the part that is or can be taken by Core Participants (or anyone else) is defined by statute and 
does not fall within the general discretion of the Inquiry. Thus, Rule 10 of the Inquiry Rules 
2006 is in these terms:

(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) to (5), where a witness is giving oral evidence at an 
inquiry hearing, only counsel to the inquiry ... and the inquiry panel may ask 
the witness questions.

(2) Where a witness, whether a core participant or otherwise, has been questioned 
orally  in  the  course  of  an  inquiry  hearing  pursuant  to  paragraph  (1),  the 
chairman may direct that the recognised legal representative of that witness 
may ask the witness questions.

(3) Where –

(a) witness  other  than  a  core  participant  has  been  questioned  orally  in  the 
course of an inquiry hearing by counsel to the inquiry, or by the inquiry 
panel; and

(b) that witness’s evidence directly relates to the evidence of another witness, 
the recognised legal representative of the witness to whom the evidence 
relates may apply to the chairman for permission to question the witness 
who has given oral evidence.

(4) The  recognised  legal  representative  of  a  core  participant  may  apply  to  the 

chairman for permission to ask questions of a witness giving oral evidence.

(5) When making an application under paragraphs (3) or (4), the recognised legal 

representative must state –
(a) the issues in respect of which a witness is to be questioned; and
(b) whether the questioning will raise new issues or, if not, why the questioning 

should be permitted.

3.4 

As early as 6 September 2011, I raised this provision and the potential consequences of it, 
observing that given the pressure on the Inquiry, subject to submissions, I “may well” require 

32

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

issues which Core Participants wished to raise to be discussed with Counsel to the Inquiry in 
the first instance; he would then be able to conduct such cross-examination as he believed 
appropriate and, at the same time, restrict other cross-examination.23 That was, in fact, the 
way in which the Inquiry proceeded but it did so in an even-handed way. By way of example, 
although Core Participants for affected newspapers suggested questions and lines of enquiry 
in relation to those who complained that they had been the victims of illegal or unethical press 
attention (and many of these were pursued by Counsel to the Inquiry when the witnesses 
gave evidence), I did not permit these witnesses to be cross examined in a manner that could 
have been appropriate in civil proceedings: I was not prepared to allow them potentially to 
be victimised again simply because they wished to complain about what had happened to 
them. Similarly, not only did I prevent cross examination by Core Participants of journalists 
and  others  in  relation  to  the  subject  matter  of  criminal  investigation;  subject  to  specific 
exceptions and the requirements of fairness enshrined in s17(3) of the Inquiries Act 2005, 
neither did I generally permit it in relation to other allegations of illegal or unethical conduct.

That is not to say that the evidence has not been probed: that is the role that Counsel to the 
Inquiry has undertaken with rigour but always with an eye to the Terms of Reference in general 
and addressing the culture, practices and ethics of the press in particular. Notwithstanding 
the general approach, however, some aspects of the evidence have been subject to detailed 
examination.

Findings of fact
Although the constraints relating to the examination of witnesses are written into the statute 
and thus have bound me, I would not want it to be thought that I considered them to be 
inappropriate or inimical to the interests of justice in this particular Inquiry. Quite the reverse. 
Had  the  procedure  been  otherwise,  this  Inquiry  need  never  have  finished.  In  relation  to 
the press and the public, the Inquiry has not only looked at the historical position but has 
traversed over 20 years of journalistic activity. Hundreds of complaints have been made and, 
although there is no issue about many, a lot more have been the subject of challenge (to 
greater or lesser effect) and could have given rise to detailed factual investigation. Those few 
stories that have been investigated in depth inevitably took a great deal of time: had it been 
necessary for each one, the time taken would have been inordinate.24

Further, the Inquiry covered far more than the press and the public. The relationship between 
the press and the police covered the tenure of no fewer than five Commissioners of Police for 
the Metropolis and crossed all national titles. Other forces, their press offices and local papers 
were also the subject of evidence. As for the relationship between press and politicians, in 
the same way that time was devoted to the bid by News Corp for the remaining shares in 
BSkyB Ltd, so many dominating political stories (from Iraq to the Euro) have been subject to 
rigorous and detailed analysis. Many have argued that this the Inquiry should have proceeded 
in this way on the basis that all were or may have been affected or influenced by the way in 

3.5

transcript-060911.pdf
24 This is one of the reasons why, given the concessions that were made by the press Core Participants, it was 
inappropriate to investigate the detail contained in the books seized from Steve Whittamore during Operation 
Motorman. For the purposes of Part 1 of the Terms of Reference, I concluded that it was necessary to go so far 
but no further: this is dealt with below but, by way of cross reference, is evident from the rulings which sought to 
ensure clarity of the position: http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Ruling-In-Relation-to-

which they were reported. The same is said for the development of press handling by the 
Government over the last 20 years. The effect, however, would have been an Inquiry that 
would have taken many years, by the end of which time the specific concerns which brought 
about the Inquiry in the first place (and, in particular, the issue of the regulation of the press) 
would have remained unaddressed, other than in whatever way the press chose themselves 
to address them in the meantime. That was not the brief that was contained within Part 1 of 
the Terms of Reference and it is not how I have sought to address them.

This means that a large number of specific individual incidents have not been the subject of 
very detailed factual investigation so that, subject to very limited exceptions, I do not feel in 
a position to make findings of fact as to what did and did not occur; neither, for the purposes 
of addressing the Terms of Reference is it necessary that I do so. One example, the subject of 
considerable press comment, will suffice.

Prior  to  autumn  2009,  The  Sun  had  supported  the  Labour  Party  in  the  three  preceding 
General Elections. During the Labour Party conference, it decided to make public a change in 
allegiance and thereafter to support the Conservative Party. For present purposes, although 
relevant to the issue of the impact of proprietors on editorial policy, the circumstances of 
that  decision  do  not  matter.  When  giving  evidence,  Rupert  Murdoch  said  that  after  this 
decision had been publicised in September 2009, he received a telephone call from the Prime 
Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, which included the observation by Mr Brown that 
“your company has declared war on my government and we have no alternative but to make 
war on your company.”25 Both in his statement and in his evidence, Mr Brown emphatically 
denied having any conversation with Mr Murdoch, still less making such a remark. When he 
gave evidence he said: “This conversation never took place. I’m shocked and surprised that it 
should be suggested, ... There was no such conversation.”26 He provided telephone records 
from the Downing Street switchboard (through which he says any such telephone call would 
have been routed) backing up this denial.

It has been suggested that it is important that I resolve this conflict of evidence and express 
my view as to where the truth lies. I decline to do so for two very different reasons. The first 
is very important in the context of the nature of the Inquiry and the manner in which it has 
had to be approached both as a matter of statute but also, as I have indicated, practicality. 
It is possible  to postulate circumstances in which the question of whether this telephone 
call took place was central to the resolution of civil litigation between the parties. In that 
event, considerable investigation would have focussed around the precise date and time of 
the alleged telephone call; questions would have been addressed to Mr Murdoch as to how 
he said that the call had been connected; phone records and other documents sought on 
discovery. Mr Murdoch would have been cross-examined at length by counsel for Mr Brown 
and vice versa. The question who to believe would have been capable of decision within a far 
fuller factual matrix. To do so, in particular, without permitting cross-examination seems to 
me to be unfair to both men.

3.11 

I recognise that judges are sometimes required to make difficult factual decisions with very 
little more than the information available and, if it was critical to do so, I would have had to 
do the best that I could. That leads me to the second reason. In short, it is neither critical 
nor, indeed, necessary to decide where the truth of this conversation lies: save in the limited 
respect of the credibility of Mr Murdoch, it is not relevant to the Terms of Reference at all.

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 2  |  The Approach

On any showing, Mr Brown would hardly have been pleased about the loss of the support for 
his Government of The Sun;whether and if so how he chose to communicate his view simply 
takes the Inquiry no further.27

3.12 

In part, I have gone into the detail of this particular factual conflict because of the interest 
and concern that has been expressed about it. Of greater importance as a reason for doing 
so has been to explain the limitations of the forensic exercise that it has been possible to 
undertake while addressing the very wide Terms of Reference within the broad timeframe 
within which I have been asked to report. This Report will not provide all the answers to all 
the questions that could possibly arise out of the uncountable number of issues that have 
been raised in evidence. Those who are expecting it to do so will be disappointed.

4.	 Other	material
4.1 

The material which can fall to be used by the Inquiry is not, however, limited to the statements 
that have been put into evidence. It has fallen to me to determine what should be part of that 
record; I have deliberately adopted as wide a definition of relevance as possible, in order to 
ensure that as full a picture of the culture, practices and ethics of the press can be put into 
the public domain by the Inquiry. In that way, the public can itself make a collective decision 
based  on  the  same  material  that  has  been  available  to  me.  Thus,  both  in  advance  of  the 
Inquiry and while it has been proceeding, different press titles have throughout presented 
the evidence and the issues (or their perception of each) and commented on the approach, 
asserting facts and reaching their own conclusions both as to what I have been doing and 
what I have been thinking. Some titles, conversely, have offered minimal, if any, coverage of 
the Inquiry for their readers. Free speech requires no less and although I have occasionally 
raised concerns about factual accuracy,28 I stand fully behind the freedom of the press to 
comment critically about me, my approach, the evidence and any other aspect of the Inquiry 
that it sees fit to write about.

4.2 

4.3 

Very  quickly,  however,  it  became  apparent  that  the  way  in  which  the  Inquiry  was  being 
reported told its own story about the culture and practices of the press. In the circumstances, 
in addition to the other evidence that has been read into the record of the Inquiry, I also 
decided that the product of a press cuttings service dealing with the Inquiry should also be 
read into the record. At several stages during the course of the hearings, I have made this fact 
clear.

The Inquiry has not been alone in commenting on the way in which the press have reported 
the Inquiry. Private Eye has regularly published commentary on the way in which it has been 
reported;  the  campaign  (on  the  website  http://hackinginquiry.org/)  has  done  the  same. 
Bloggers have added their own comment and the Inquiry has engaged with Twitter (http://
twitter.com/@levesoninquiry)  on  which  there  has  been  a  regular  and  substantial  dialogue 
about the Inquiry both in this country and abroad. This also is a very powerful example of the 
proper manifestation of free speech.

27 For reasons which will become apparent, I take a slightly different view in relation to the disclosure of the medical 
condition of Mr Brown’s son: see Part F, Chapter 5

A5.	 Submissions
5.1 

In addition to leading Counsel to the Inquiry, all those who were Core Participants for Module 
One made formal opening submissions at its commencement.29 There were submissions at 
the start of Module Two from Mr Jay, and also on behalf of the Commissioner of Police for the 
Metropolis and the Metropolitan Police Authority (now the Mayor’s Office for Policing and 
Crime).30 Module Three was opened only by Mr Jay.31

5.2 

5.3 

In  the  same  way,  Counsel  to  the  Inquiry  and  the  Core  Participants  have  assisted  me with 
argument in relation to the rulings to which I have referred above and other issues that have 
arisen during the course of the hearings. On more than one occasion, it was necessary to 
deal with disclosure of information that had been shared with Core Participants in advance 
of its publication: these were highly relevant during the course of the hearings but are now 
unnecessary further to rehearse.32 Submissions have also been received dealing with issues 
of  evidence,  on  the  approach  to  Rule  13  of  the  Inquiry  Rules  2006  and  in  relation  to  the 
standard of proof, the last two of which I deal with below. Submissions  have generally in 
writing and supplemented orally; all are also published on the website so that it is possible to 
see the entirety of the argument put before me as well as the ruling that followed.

Final submissions on various aspects of the Inquiry have also been received following the 
conclusion of the various modules. In the main, they have been extremely thorough, very 
detailed and, as a consequence, extremely lengthy. They have clearly been the product of an 
enormous amount of work and I am grateful for the effort and very great care that has been 
put  into  them.  The  fact  that  some  arguments  and  submissions  have  not  been  specifically 
addressed  in  this  Report  is  not  intended  as  a  discourtesy  either  to  the  writers  or  to  the 
arguments. Inevitably, this Report has had to focus on the Terms of Reference, whereas the 
relevant Core Participants have understandably cast their nets rather wider in order to deal 
both with the generality and the specifics of some of the issues that have been raised to such 
extent as they affect them.

5.4 

Although it was always anticipated that it could be necessary to re-convene the Inquiry, to 
obtain updated information in relation to the police investigations and to receive any other 
important evidence that had emerged following the conclusion of the hearings in July 2012, 
written and oral closing submissions were invited and presented by most (but not all) of the 
Core Participants. To such extent as they address the future, they shall be analysed during the

course of the consideration of the regulatory regime, although I shall be doing so from the 
perspective of ‘the press’ as opposed to the extent to which individual titles have behaved 
in such a way as requires a different approach to regulation. I saw no value in Counsel to the 
Inquiry making a closing submission and he did not do so.

6.	 Engagement	with	the	public:	the	website
6.1 

Before  turning  to  the  issues  of  law  that  have  had  to  be  considered  as  part  of  the  Report 
writing  process,  I  return  to  the  website  because  it  is  appropriate  to  say  something  more 
about the way in which the Inquiry has sought to involve the public in its process and ensure 
that the evidence which has been given has received the widest audience.

6.2 

I have referred to the questions that were posted on the Inquiry website as each module 
came to be discussed in the evidence. The purpose was to engage with as wide a reach of 
members of the public as possible and to obtain as wide a range of views as possible. The 
extent of that response can be judged from Appendix B which sets out a detailed record of 
the type and number of communications received by the Inquiry through the general mailbox 
or  otherwise.  Where  it  was  possible  to  do  so,  every  communication  (a  number  of  which 
were anonymous) was acknowledged and considered so that a decision could be taken as 
to whether it was right to take what was said forward in any way. Although I recognise that 
a  number  of  those  who  wrote  will  have  been  disappointed  that  they  were  not  given  the 
opportunity to give oral evidence, I explicitly recognise and pay tribute to the very hard work 
that has been put into ensuring that all the observations have been received have been acted 
upon appropriately.

6.3 

Appendix  B  also  identifies  the  number  of  times  up  to  the  end  of  October  2012  that  the 
Inquiry website has been accessed along with its reach. I believe that the Inquiry has done as 
much as could reasonably have been expected to engage with the public would be surprised 
if any public inquiry has achieved as much public access. I have no doubt that this has all 
contributed to the public reaction to events and the further debate as to the way forward.

FurTher issues oF Law

1.	 Rule	13	of	the	Inquiry	Rules	2006:	the	approach
1.1 

Prior to the publication of any Report which includes explicit or significant criticism of any 
person, the Inquiry Rules 2006 mandate that such a person must be warned of that criticism 
and  given  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  respond.  I  set  out  the  background  and  the  legal 
framework in a ruling on the Application of Rule 131 which I can do no better than repeat:

“8.  One  of  the  touchstones  of  the  inquisitorial  process  prescribed  by  the  2005 
[Inquiries] Act is the requirement of fairness to all. Whereas s. 17(1) of the Act provides 
that the procedure and conduct of the Inquiry shall be such as I direct, that provision 
is subject to s. 17(3) in these terms:
“In making any decision as to the procedure or conduct of an inquiry, the chairman 
must act with fairness and with regard to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost 
(whether to public funds or to witnesses or others).”
9.  No higher manifestation of that duty is apparent than that which deals with the 
requirement  that  those  who  may  be  criticised  in  any  report  have  the  opportunity 
afforded to them to deal with the basis of that criticism. The origin is to be found 
in  the  Royal  Commission  on  Tribunals  of  Inquiry  (Cmnd  3121,  1966)  (“the  Salmon 
Report”) which proposed, among other recommendations, that before a person was 
called as a witness, he should be informed of any allegations which are made against 
him and the substance of the evidence in support of them: thus were born Salmon 
letters  although  over-rigid  adherence  has  been  recognised  as  ‘unhelpful’:  see  the 
observations of Sir Richard Scott VC (in (1995) 111 LQR 596) to the effect that every 
inquiry must adapt its procedures to meet its own circumstances.
10.  The next manifestation of this requirement (described as ‘fair play in action’ by 
Sachs  LJ  in  Re  Pergamon  Press  Ltd  [1971]  Ch  388  at  405)  dealt  with  comment  on 
proposed criticism. Mr Robert Maxwell’s attempt to obtain sight of proposed draft 
conclusions was rejected in the Court of Appeal when Lawton LJ put the matter in this 
way: see Maxwell v Department of Trade and Industry [1974] QB 523 at page 541B-
D: “Those who conduct inquiries have to base their decisions, findings, conclusions or 
opinions ... on the evidence. In my judgment they are no more bound to tell a witness 
likely to be criticised in their report what they have in mind to say about him than has 
a judge sitting alone who has to decide which of two conflicting witnesses is telling 
the truth. The judge must ensure that the witness whose credibility is suspected has a 
fair opportunity of correcting or contradicting the substance of what other witnesses 
have said or are expected to say which is in conflict with his testimony. Inspectors 
should do the same but I can see no reason why they should do any more.”
11.  Notwithstanding  these  judicial  observations,  the  broad  process  was  adopted 
by Lord Bingham in the BCCI Inquiry, by Sir Richard Scott in the Inquiry into Matrix 
Churchill and also by Sir John Chilcott in the Iraq Inquiry. This lack of clarity is itself 
unhelpful  and  potentially  productive  either  of  very  substantial  delay  or  satellite 
litigation (in each case with attendant cost) or both.

AChapter 3  |  Further Issues of Law

12.  The  2005  Act  (pursuant  to  which  this  Inquiry  is  being  conducted)  adopts  a 
different and, in my judgment, self-contained approach to ensure fairness. First, s. 21 
of the Act provides that I may by notice require any person to provide evidence in the 
form of a written statement along with documents. Such notices have identified, in 
comprehensive terms, the issues with which the statement has been required to deal; 
where appropriate, it has identified relevant documents or other public statements 
which should be addressed. It cannot, of course, deal with evidence not then seen by 
the Inquiry but where issues of significance have arisen before the witness arrives, 
forewarning has been given and, if necessary, witnesses allowed time to deal with a 
matter for which they were not prepared. Where the issue has arisen only after the 
witness has given evidence, again if it is significant, second statements have been 
requested and obtained; more than one witness has been required to return to give 
further evidence.
13.  The  second  (and  most  extensive)  protection  is  provided  by  Rules  13-15  of  the 
Inquiry Rules 2006 (‘the 2006 Rules’) which concern what are described as Warning 
Letters. Thus, Rule 13 provides:

(1) The Chairman may send a warning letter to any person:

(a) he considers maybe, or who has been, subject to criticism in the inquiry 

proceedings; or

(b) about whom criticism may be inferred from evidence that has been given 

during the inquiry proceedings; or

(c) who may be subject to criticism in the report, or any interim report.

(2)  The  recipient  of  a  warning  letter  may  disclose  it  to  his  recognised  legal 

representative.

(3)  The  inquiry  panel  must  not  include  any  explicit  or  significant  criticism  of  a 

person in the report, or in any interim report, unless
(a) the chairman has sent that person a warning letter; and
(b) the  person  has  been  given  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  respond  to  the 

warning letter.”

1.2 

In  my  ruling,  I  explained  the  ways  in  which  I  have  sought  to  ensure  that  the  Inquiry  was 
conducted fairly and with full regard to the position of all who might be affected. In relation to 
Rule 13, therefore, I concluded that a warning addressed to a section of the press consisting 
of the national titles (even if a number of those have not been the subject of criticism or 
complaint) allowed each to make submissions as to the conclusions that I should draw as to 
the culture, practices and ethics of the press generally (as opposed to the specific conduct 
of  individual  titles  although  it  has  been  made  clear  titles  have  been  free  to  comment  on 
stories which are identifiably referable to them). I went on to conclude not only that generic 
criticisms  should  be  evidence  based,  but  that  the  justification  for  my  concerns  should  be 
“visible and capable of being understood both by those affected and by the public”.2

1.3 

I appreciate (as was argued by Mr Desmond Browne QC for Trinity Mirror plc) that this could 
allow anyone following the references through to the transcript to identify the titles and, 
perhaps, the relevant journalists; in reality, however, that would be possible whether or not 
I identified the references and, on the basis that I have not made specific findings in most 
individual cases, this approach does not offend the general principle that I am not focussing

on the detail of ‘who did what to whom’. It is equally consistent with the principle that my 
intention not to prejudice criminal proceedings means that I have not identified those alleged 
to have been involved in mobile phone interception; therefore, in fairness, although there are 
exceptions when I have considered that the narrative compels specificity, generally speaking, 
I  have  exercised  similar  restraint  in  respect  of  those,  not  being  investigated,  who  may  be 
responsible for similar or other illegal or unethical practices.

Conscious that any approach to Rule 13 was likely to be contentious, I arranged for the matter 
to be argued in principle and ruled on the approach generally. This ruling fell within to s38(1)
(b)  of  the  Inquiries  Act  2005  and  had  any  Core  Participant  wished  to  challenge  it  by  way 
of judicial review, that course was open within 14 days. There was no such challenge and, 
insofar as generic criticism is concerned, I have followed it.

I  have,  however,  issued  Rule  13  warnings  to  individuals  (and  others  concerned  with  the 
relationship  between  the  press  and  the  public)  in  those  circumstances  where  I  thought 
fairness warranted it and, in particular, when I was concerned that any conclusion that I might 
reach in relation to a specific incident could be said to contain an express or implied criticism 
of them. The touchstone has been to provide an opportunity to make representations about 
identifiable concerns that I was proposing to express.

Having  said  that,  it  is  important  that  I  emphasise  that  this  Report  should  not  be  read  as 
addressing the individual conduct of members of the press in their dealings with the public 
and no implied criticism should be read into the fact that references to particular complaints 
are inevitably to particular stories written by identifiable journalists (albeit not named in the 
text of the Report). I cannot repeat too often that this part of the Inquiry is not concerned 
with individual conduct but with the culture, practices and ethics of the press (or a section of 
the press) as a whole. Who would be to blame for a particular egregious story? Would it be a 
proprietor or editor who ordained a particular approach or a particular agenda? Would it be 
the journalist who felt driven to do what had been bidden irrespective of personal qualms? 
Would it be the sub-editor who wrote a headline that misrepresented what should be derived 
from  correctly  identified  facts  or  modified  the  words  of  caution  that  the  journalist  had 
carefully included? How could I decide between these cumulative or alternative possibilities? 
In the circumstances, I have only been able to take the story at face value along with the 
reaction of the subject of the story and my view of the law (for example in relation to privacy) 
and the Editors’ Code of Practice.

The result of this analysis is that, in relation to most of the complaints made by those who 
have been subject to press intrusion I have not issued Rule 13 letters. This is because I do 
not intend either expressly or by implication to make explicit or significant criticism of the 
relevant journalists (rather than, generically, of the press). If I had done otherwise, hundreds 
of journalists (if not more), most of whom have neither been asked nor volunteered to give 
evidence to the Inquiry or even to make a statement, would have had to receive a warning. 
Having said that, if, in any particular case or in relation to any particular example that I wish 
to highlight, I have been in doubt, I have issued a warning and provided an opportunity for 
representations  to  be  made.  In  reaching  my  conclusions,  I  have  taken  full  account  of  the 
representations that I have received in response to all these warnings including those issued 
generically to the press.

1.8 

In relation to Module Two and the police, different considerations apply on the basis that 
there being no ongoing criminal investigation into the conduct of the MPS (although there are 

40

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 3  |  Further Issues of Law

inquiries into other aspects of police conduct in relation to the press).3 On the other hand, 
I  received  detailed  submissions  from  Counsel  for  the  MPS  both  generally  and  specifically 
as to the interaction of Parts 1 and 2 of the Inquiry. In the circumstances, I separately ruled 
in relation to the application of Rule 13 both to the MPS and to individual police officers.4 
Again, I have followed it and issued Rule 13 letters both general and specific in nature, taking 
full account of the representations that I have received.

1.9  Module  Three  raised  different  issues  for  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  there  is  no  criminal 
investigation that could affect my approach and, in addition, it does not appear that there 
will be any other consideration of the general issues which I have to address in the Terms of 
Reference; that might be thought to be a basis for encouraging me to range further and wider 
than in relation to the other modules. On the other hand, the Terms of Reference are specific 
to  the  culture,  practices  and  ethics  of  the  press  ‘including  contacts  and  the  relationships 
between national newspapers and politicians, and the conduct of each’. It is argued that the 
Inquiry should investigate the nature of friendships between individual members of the press 
and individual politicians but, save to the extent that these bite or may bite upon the way in 
which a journalist (or politician) attend to his or her professional duties, it does not appear to 
me that it is necessary or appropriate for me to enquire. Throughout the hearing of Module 
Three, I emphasised that politicians were entitled to be friendly with whosoever they wished; 
absent some impact on the public interest, it is no part of the work of the Inquiry to challenge 
that right.

1.10  Second,  each  of  the  major  UK  political  parties  has  recognised,  in  general  terms,  that  the 
relationship between politicians and the press has become too close: indeed, that was the 
conclusion  expressed  by  the  Prime  Minister  and  his  three  predecessors  when  they  gave 
evidence.  For  me  to  express  that  conclusion,  however,  undeniably  constitutes  an  ‘explicit 
or  significant  criticism’  in  respect  of  which  I  must  issue  a  Rule  13  letter.  Such  a  criticism, 
however, is not intended to be personal but generic. It recognises that how close is too close 
is itself a very difficult and nuanced issue, given that it is critically important, in a democratic 
society, that politicians engage with the press and seek to explain their policies to the public 
through the press.

1.11  The  third  concern  has  been  the  extent  to  which  the  work  of  the  Inquiry  has  involved 
contemporary  political  issues  with  the  risk  of  entering  into  a  party  political  debate  which 
is no part of its function: this particularly relates to the attempted acquisition News Corp 
of  the  publicly  owned  shares  in  BSkyB  Ltd.  I  made  it  clear  that  I  would  not  opine  on  the 
Ministerial Code or seek to prevent Parliament from investigating whatever aspect of the bid 
it wished to investigate;5 however, I recognise that it constitutes the most recent and most 
well documented inter-reaction between a very powerful media organisation and politicians 
(although  the  interaction  in  relation  to  the  legislative  proposals  now  contained  in  s77-78 
of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 which has not yet been implemented are 
also important). I have, therefore, attempted to analyse these issues from a general, cultural 
perspective: the process has inevitably involved a consideration of individual decisions and, 
on the basis that, even if not explicit, implied significant criticism may be inferred, I have 
issued appropriate warnings accordingly.

3 In particular, in relation to the knowledge and understanding (a) in 2002 of Surrey Police as to the interception of the 
mobile phone of Milly Dowler and (b) in 2008 of Cleveland Police in relation to e mail hacking of John Darwin who had 
faked his own death in a canoe

A1.12 

1.13 

I can deal with Module Four quite shortly. In this Report, each of the ideas put before the 
Inquiry has been subject to rigorous analysis and none more so than the proposals advanced 
by  Lord  Black  of  Brentwood  (on  behalf  of  the  Press  Board  of  Finance)  and  advocated  by, 
among others, Lord Hunt of Wirral, the Chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. It is 
right that they should be, not least because, from the outset of the Inquiry and throughout, 
I encouraged the press to put forward their own ideas for press regulation, bearing in mind 
not  only  the  values  which  it  held  to  be  important  but  also  the  interests  of  the  public  as 
demonstrated not only by the demand for this Inquiry but also by the evidence which has 
been given to it.

I appreciate that Lord Black has had to deal with a wide spread of press interest; I have no 
doubt that different constituents have put forward different priorities and different ideas and 
that, furthermore, Lord Black has done his best to bring everyone to a common consensus 
which I expect is also consistent with his own ideas. Any concern or criticism that I have of 
the final formulation, however, is not a criticism of him or, indeed, any other person whether 
individual or corporate: neither should it be seen as such. In those circumstances, I have not 
felt it appropriate or necessary to give advance warning of my concerns but have simply set 
them out in the body of the Report.

2.	 Rule	13	of	the	Inquiry	Rules	2006:	the	practice
2.1 

The reason for the existence of Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules is clear from this analysis. Flowing 
from that, however, are two further consequences. The first is the fact that a notice is only 
necessary to address potential criticism: it is not intended to present a balanced picture of 
any sort. Nobody needs to be warned of the risk that their conduct might be applauded. The 
point was clear from the body of the letter which explained:

“By definition, this letter is focussed on the aspects of the culture, practices and ethics 
of the press which may attract criticism and it is not the function of this letter to refer 
to the evidence of good culture, practice and ethics which the Inquiry has received.”

2.2 

The second consequence flows from the first. A possible criticism should not be interpreted 
as one that will inevitably be made. As a result, the letter also made it clear that both it and 
any response were subject to “a legal duty of confidence” owed in the public interest under 
Rule 14(1)(b) of the Inquiry Rules 2006.6 This requirement (expressly mandated in the Rules) 
is specifically designed to discourage public discussion or debate about criticisms which have 
not yet been made and which could well, in the end, be less serious. It was and is, therefore, 
a  demonstrable  attempt  to  be  fair  and  to  provide  an  opportunity  to  those  who  might  be 
affected to make submissions about possible criticism at a time when, as I made clear, I was 
continuing to reflect on the narrative and conclusions which I would reach and before I had 
done so.

2.3 

Thus, although it has been portrayed as such, the letter is not intended to be a secret: it is 
only confidential until the Report is signed or published,7 after which time anyone is free to 
discuss the letters, criticise their content and analyse the extent to which my views might 
have changed. My concluded view, as expressed in the Report, will then be available.

6 This obligation of confidence is owed by the Inquiry team to any recipient of the letter and by that recipient to me, 
as Chairman of the Inquiry: see para. 14(1) of the Inquiry Rules 2006
7 The obligation ceases, as far as I am concerned, when I sign the Report and, so far as everyone else is concerned, 
when the Report is published: see para. 14(3) and (4) of the Inquiry Rules 2006

42

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 3  |  Further Issues of Law

2.4 

2.5 

It is therefore not in the least surprising that the letters are “one-sided,” that the positive 
should not be subject to a similar letter, or that I would be concerned if the contents were 
being openly discussed in the press.8 All are, of course, entitled to express whatever view 
they wish about the summary of press practice that can be culled from the evidence but it is 
worth repeating (not for the first, or the last, time) that the criticisms that I have suggested 
were not directed at the entirety of the press: most journalists, most if not all the time, do 
not behave in the way that, on my assessment of the evidence, a small but not insignificant 
number  have  behaved,  thereby  generating  criticism  of  the  culture  that  permitted  this  to 
happen, the practices involved and the ethics of those who have behaved in that way. As in 
every other walk of life, regulation is required for the small minority.

A number of recipients of Rule 13 letters have questioned the fairness of the process on various 
grounds, and I should record that I have considered these objections and submissions with 
great care, always in the context of my ultimate obligation under section 17 of the Inquiries 
Act  to  act  fairly.  I  am  completely  satisfied  that  all  recipients  who  have  chosen  to  submit 
substantive responses have understood the issues in respect of which I have sought further 
assistance,  and  have  addressed  them  in  appropriate  detail.  In  the  few  instances  where  it 
appeared that recipients might have misunderstood the point that I wished them to have the 
opportunity to address, I have provided further explanation and given them that opportunity. 
In the result, many of my provisional conclusions have been revised or reformulated to reflect 
the Rule 13 process and the representations that I have received.

The starting point for any consideration of the nature of what must be proved and the standard 
of proof is, from the outset, to recognise that the Inquiry has been set up specifically because 
“particular events have caused ... public concern”.9 To some extent, it is sufficient simply to 
refer back to the Terms of Reference of Part 1 of the Inquiry but, summarising at least the 
most important of these events, it would be appropriate to include as topics about which I 
have been required to inquire:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

the disclosure of the interception of Milly Dowler’s mobile phone messages and the 
deletion of such messages;
the  fact  that  it  was  common  ground  that  the  News  of  the  World  had  engaged  in 
interception  of  mobile  phone  messages  (revealed  in  civil  litigation  and  otherwise) 
contrary to the continued assertion that Clive Goodman was one “rogue reporter”;
other complaints of illegal or unethical methods by which journalists obtained stories 
(not the least significant being activity in breach of Data Protection legislation leading 
to a concern about the policy, operation and effectiveness of the regulatory regime for 
data protection);
the harassment and pressure placed both on members of the public caught up in stories 
attracting enormous press coverage and those in the public eye whether because of 

8 Writing in the Observer on 2 September 2012 (http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/02/simon-fox-trinity-
music-man-record?INTCMP=SRCH) , Peter Preston said that I was “spraying” a “confidential” 118-page letter of early 
criticisms around Fleet Street which had been described as a “diatribe”, a “completely one-sided” attack that resembles 
“loading a gun” and “excoriating”. He suggested that my disappointment that my comments were being openly 
discussed in the press was an indication that “he still doesn’t quite get it” so that he suffers “just ‘disappointment’ if 
it doesn’t leak instantly”. It might also simply demonstrate that not enough care has been taken to understand the 
process and to comply with sensible obligations specifically designed to be fair to all

their celebrity or otherwise;
the failure of the Press Complaints Commission to address the activities of the News 
of the World (save only to exonerate them and criticise The Guardian for its reporting); 
to provide adequate regulatory oversight in relation to the press; to provide adequate 
redress for those complaining of press misconduct save in limited circumstances; and 
to ensure that its remit embraced the press as a whole;
the nature of the relationship between the press and the police and, in particular, the 
extent to which failure of the police properly to investigate the extent of interception 
of mobile phone messages was a consequence of that relationship;
the way in which politicians engaged with the press and, in particular, the extent to which 
the commercial interests of the press influenced the development or implementation 
of policy, along with the failure to address prior concerns over many years relating to 
media misconduct; and
the  impact  of  the  plurality  of  the  media  and  cross  media  ownership  on  the  public 
interest.

3.2  More  important  than  the  topics  about  which  I  am  required  to  inquire  are  the  subjects 
about which I am required to make recommendations. It is sufficient to repeat the Terms of 
Reference which are expressed in this way:

“To make recommendations:

(a) for  a  new  more  effective  policy  and  regulatory  regime  which  supports 
the  integrity  and  freedom  of  the  press,  the  plurality  of  the  media,  and  its 
independence,  including  from  Government,  while  encouraging  the  highest 
ethical and professional standards;

(b) for how future concerns about press behaviour, media policy, regulation and 
cross-media ownership should be dealt with by all the relevant authorities, 
including Parliament, Government, the prosecuting authorities and the police;

(c)  the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press; and
(d) the future conduct of relations between the police and the press.”

3.3 

These issues are to be contrasted with those set out in Part 2 of the Terms of Reference, 
which are specifically directed to a far more fact focussed investigation of the conduct of 
News International and other newspaper organisations (“the extent of unlawful or improper 
conduct”, “the extent of corporate governance and management failures”), along with the 
police  (“the  extent  to  which  the  police  received  corrupt  payments  or  other  inducements, 
or were otherwise complicit in such misconduct or in suppressing its proper investigation”) 
and politicians (“the role, if any, of politicians, public servants and others in relation to any 
failure to investigate wrongdoing at News International”). In Part 2, there is a requirement 
“to consider the implications” of what is then found to have happened. In other words, Part 
1 of this Inquiry is a qualitative exercise of sufficient breadth to determine the appropriate 
recommendations to make for the future. Part 2 is a quantitative exercise: how extensive have 
been the identified failures in News International, other press organisations, the police, the 
political class, public servants or others? On that basis, the implications (and any additional 
recommendations fall to be addressed. Part 2 requires a far greater and more detailed factual 
investigation than has Part 1: this is not surprising given that the Terms of Reference were 
split into two because of the ongoing police investigation and the lack of clarity as to where 
it might lead).

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 3  |  Further Issues of Law

3.4 

Against  that  background  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  overriding  obligation  as  to  the 
procedure or conduct of the Inquiry, which requires me “to act with fairness and with regard 
to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost”.10 Further, although the Inquiry may “not rule on 
and has no power to determine, any person’s civil or criminal liability”, it is not inhibited in 
the discharge of its function “by any likelihood of liability being inferred from the facts that it 
determines or recommendations that it makes”.11 Subject to this framework, the obligation is 
set out in s24(1) of the Inquiries Act 2005 in these terms:

“The Chairman of an inquiry must deliver a report to the Minister setting out –

3.5 

3.6 

(a) the facts determined by the inquiry panel;
(b) the recommendations of the panel ...

The report may also contain anything else that the panel considers to be relevant to 
the terms of reference (including any recommendations the panel sees fit to make 
despite not being required to do so by the terms of reference)”.

The facts as determined, however, are those which are necessary in order to provide the 
context  for  the  recommendations.  Focussing  on  the  relationship  between  the  press  and 
the public, therefore, the submission that a single or occasional instance of misconduct will 
not itself justify any adverse finding about the culture, practices or ethics of the press is to 
proceed on the mistaken basis of thinking quantitatively rather than qualitatively. In relation 
to the future of regulation, the question whether a new regime is appropriate must be asked 
by reference to how the present regulatory regime has dealt with such issues as have arisen 
and whether it retains public confidence. If problems with or concerns about the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press are – represented by a single or occasional example – it may 
not be appropriate or necessary to recommend any change. Nobody, however, has submitted 
that this is the case. It is not challenged that there is legitimate public concern about the 
regulatory regime which it is no longer suggested is fit for purpose; the issue is the extent of 
that problem and the benefits and detriments of possible solutions.

Neither  does  it  matter  that  any  problem  is  limited  to  one  or  a  small  number  of  titles.  A 
regulatory regime must deal with all titles and be in a position appropriately to deal with 
even a single recalcitrant paper; it is irrelevant if one or more title never attracts its adverse 
attention.  To  that  extent,  the  approach  of  at  least  one  newspaper  group  to  the  Inquiry, 
restricting  itself  to  demonstrating  how  illegal  or  unethical  activity  cannot  be  placed  at  its 
door, has wholly missed the point. I have no intention of either applauding one paper for its 
culture, practices and ethics or (with the exception of the NoTW) of condemning another. The 
reason for the exception is so that the public do not ascribe to other titles the many criticisms 
that have been articulated about that one. What I sought from all Core Participants (but have 
not always received) was an analysis of the extent to which, as a matter of generality, there 
was a problem with the culture, practices and ethics of the press or a section of the press, 
so that it would be possible to consider a new and sufficiently robust policy and regulatory 
regime which supports the integrity and freedom of the press but also reflects the legitimate 
rights of others.

3.7 

In argument, it has been submitted that it is appropriate for the Inquiry to express its findings 
at  a  high  level  of  generality.  The  point  is  made  in  this  way.  It  does  not  matter  whether, 
for  example,  phone  hacking  occurred  only  at  one  title  or  was  more  widespread  since  it 
is  an  established  problem  of  conduct  by  at  least  part  of  the  press  which  will  inform  the 
recommendations  made.  Similarly,  the  problem  of  intrusion  on  grief  identified  by  certain 

10 s17(3) of the Inquiries Act 2005
11 s2(1) and (2) of the Inquiries Act 2005

45

A3.8 

3.9 

witnesses is a problem of conduct by at least part of the press and it matters not for the 
purpose of making recommendations whether it occurred only at one title, at several titles, 
or  at  all  titles.  From  this  perspective  the  Inquiry  can  find  that  there  are  ‘concerns’  about 
alleged press misconduct without determining whether the particular type of misconduct 
occurred  on  one  occasion  or  one  hundred,  at  one  title  or  many.  This  puts  the  qualitative 
versus the quantitative argument at its highest.

To a point, the argument is well made and correct. I have already concluded, however, that a 
single or occasional instance of misconduct may not be sufficient to justify an adverse finding 
about culture, practices and ethics on the basis that it is of no real significance. Neither am I 
prepared to proceed on the basis that the argument of ‘one rogue reporter’ can be replaced, 
by the remainder of the press, with an argument of ‘one rogue newspaper title’: if that is 
what I consider the position to be, I shall so conclude. That does not require me to decide 
how  extensive  was  the  practice  or  knowledge  of  phone  hacking  (although  keeping  quiet 
about a known abuse of the law by another title itself says something about culture, practices 
and ethics, on the basis that who otherwise will hold the press to account) but, in any event, 
illegality and unethical behaviour comes in many different forms and it is the overall picture 
that is critical.

That is not to say that I will not deal with individual cases because worked examples can 
exemplify the problems that exist even in titles that are not the subject of repeated complaint 
and these may add to the overall picture. As a consequence, it is important to underline that 
it is not an inevitable inference that the culture, practices and ethics of the title affected is 
driven by the problem that I am exemplifying. Each generality along with each example is 
intended to provide or add to the narrative of facts against which to judge the regulatory 
regime and consider what should now take its place.

3.10  Against  that  background,  a  consideration  of  the  standard  of  proof  becomes  much  more 
straightforward. I accept that the public interest requires that the findings of the Inquiry are 
expressed in such a way that can readily be understood to be a judgment on what has occurred 
and  why  any  recommendations  have  been  made  and,  furthermore,  that  the  appropriate 
standard is that applicable in all but criminal cases, namely the balance of probability. To put 
it more colloquially, before reaching a conclusion, for example, that an event has happened, 
I must conclude that its occurrence is more likely than not. I further recognise both from an 
analysis of Re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)12 and the subsequent decisions of 
R(N) v Mental Health Review Tribunal (Northern Region)13 and Re D14 that the application of 
the balance of probabilities is flexible in its application in that the more serious the allegation, 
the more careful the analysis of the facts will have to be not least because of the reduced 
likelihood of it being true.15

3.11 

In my ruling in relation to the application of Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, I raised the 
question  whether  it  was  sufficient  that  I  consider  whether  the  evidence  reveals  such  a 
concern about particular conduct  that regulatory arrangements should  be put in place to 
deal  with  that  type  of  behaviour  should  it  arise.16  I  there  had  regard  to  the  Baha  Mousa 
Inquiry conducted by The Rt Hon Sir William Gage who, referring to s24(1) of the Inquiries Act

2005 (to the effect that the report could contain “anything else the panel considers relevant 
to the terms of reference”), concluded that it was open to him to express suspicion that an 
allegation is true. He recognised that such a comment would not be a finding of fact and that 
the power so to conclude “should be exercised sparingly”.17

3.12 

I  accept  that  unresolved  suspicions,  on  their  own,  do  not  provide  a  sufficient  basis  for 
conclusions, in particular as to the success or otherwise of the present regulatory regime 
but  the  words  ‘on  their  own’  are  important.  By  way  of  example,  I  can  conclude  without 
difficulty  that  mobile  phone  interception  was  far  more  extensive  at  the  NoTW  than  was 
initially admitted and I can also be satisfied that knowledge of the technique was far more 
widespread than the confines of the NoTW but, until the Guardian article in 2009, it was not 
addressed by the press or the PCC.

3.13  That alone is likely to be sufficient to justify a new approach to regulation but it seems to 
me that I can (and should) be able to go much further. A considerable body of evidence has 
been adduced which gives rise to reasonable grounds for believing that knowledge of the 
practice was linked to its use, albeit there is not the hard evidence (such as comes from the 
Mulcaire material) of names, telephone numbers and the like. It seems to me that it could be 
possible to conclude, inferentially, on the balance of probability, that others were involved in 
the practice; it might be fairer, however, (and sufficient to add to the weight of any conclusion 
about the need for a new approach to regulation) simply to conclude that there are strong 
reasonable grounds for believing that it did. I recognise, however, the need for real caution 
before proceeding along these lines.

3.14  Mr Jonathan Caplan QC for Associated Newspapers Ltd argues that any general statement 
that there are grounds to suspect senior executives within a section of the national press 
of  knowledge,  concealment  or  acquiescence  in  voicemail  interception  raised  very  serious 
reputational  issues  for  those  senior  personnel  reasonably  considered  by  the  public  to  be 
within that section of the press (that is to say the tabloid or popular press). It is argued that 
such conclusions should not be reached unless the evidence discloses objectively reasonable 
grounds  to  suspect  those  executives  which  it  cannot  because  there  has  been  no  proper 
investigation of the issue.

3.15 

I have not singled out ‘senior executives’ for special mention but it is important to make the 
point that this should not and does not mean that, in appropriate cases, individual titles (and 
individual executives or journalists) will not be identified or identifiable. The effect of the 
argument that to do so offends my general approach is that I would not be able to reach any 
conclusion because to criticise any individual title or group is to criticise the editor. This is no 
more than a repetition of the argument that I rejected in the ruling on Rule 13 concerning 
the implied criticism of those involved18 which was not thereafter challenged. I am certainly 
prepared to accept, however, that I should not criticise any individual by name unless satisfied 
on the balance of probability that such criticism is justified.

3.16  Similar,  but  not  identical,  reasoning  applies  to  my  approach  to  the  relations  between  the 
press and the police (Module Two) and the press and politicians (Module Three) and I will 
express my conclusions about the nature and impact of those relationships on the balance of 
probability. In both of these cases, there is no complication of pending criminal investigation 
which could limit my ability to focus on individual conduct.

A3.17 

In connection both with the police and with politicians, the material before the Inquiry is 
sufficient to reach conclusions on the important questions without having to consider issues 
of reasonable suspicion but the complication in these relationships arises in connection with 
the additional question of perception. Thus, by way of example, it has been suggested that 
‘deals’ were struck between the press and politicians to the mutual advantage of both. That 
allegation  has  been  strenuously  denied  both  by  the  press  and  by  politicians.  Quite  apart 
from that, however, there is the very different issue of whether, even assuming there was 
no such ‘deal’, the behaviour of both gave rise to legitimate perception in the public that the 
relationship was being conducted in a way that was not in the public interest. On that basis, 
it may be entirely wrong to suggest or conclude that there was impropriety of any sort but 
still correct to decide that the way in which the relationship is handled from the perspective 
both of the press and politicians requires adjustment so that each can perform their duty but 
in a way that does not give rise an adverse perception. A similar problem arises in connection 
with the relationships between the press and the police (in particular in relation to the refusal 
to re-open investigations into mobile phone interception).

The reporT

1.	 Scope
1.1 

The Inquiry is UK-wide in its scope. It was set up, and its Terms of Reference were finalised, with 
the support of the Devolved Governments of the UK in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. 
In so far as my recommendations address matters within areas of devolved competence, it will 
of course be for the devolved administrations and legislatures to consider them in the usual 
way. I have not, however, sought to any extent at all in this Report to analyse the position 
separately from the perspective of the devolved jurisdictions, nor to acknowledge, where 
legal matters are considered, the points on which different law applies in different parts of 
the UK. My timetable did not allow for that; it would have been a very complex and time-
consuming exercise. I recognise in the result that my Report may be less helpful to those with 
decision-making responsibilities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, but I have sought 
to set out my analysis and conclusions in a sufficiently explicit and reasoned way to enable 
the experts within the devolved jurisdictions to see as readily as possible how they could be 
made to fit. I have not been made aware of any technical reason why my recommendations 
should not be able to be accommodated, with appropriate adjustment, in all parts of the 
UK, but I have not sought detailed advice on the matter. I intend no discourtesy at all by 
this  approach  and  hope  that  those  with  the  relevant  decision-making  responsibilities  will 
understand the reasons.

2.	 Purpose
2.1 

This Report fulfils three quite separate functions. First, it is an account of the Inquiry. The 
purpose of the Inquiry was to inquire into the culture practices and ethics of the press and to 
make recommendations. By conducting the Inquiry in public and in such a way that it can be 
followed by anyone with an interest to do so, the story has emerged but it is important that 
it is collected together in one place and I have attempted to do that as a balanced account 
of what has transpired. Further, that balance can be checked. Anyone is able to go onto the 
Inquiry  website,  watch  the  play-back  of  the  evidence,  read  every  statement  of  witnesses 
whether called or simply introduced into the record, examine every relevant document in 
the form made part of that record whether specifically referred to not and consider every 
submission from a Core Participant or Counsel to the Inquiry and so form his or her own 
conclusion about the balance of the Report.

2.2 

Collecting  the  material  and  presenting  it  in  an  ordered  form  has  generated  an  additional 
issue.  It  will  quickly  be  obvious  that  some  stories  appear  in  more  than  one  place  in  the 
narrative and some not at all. That is not because different examples of types of conduct are 
not available from either the material called at the Inquiry or read into the record; neither 
is it because of my over-reliance on a particular witness and the story that he or she had 
to recount. It is important to appreciate, however, that in some instances, manifestations 
of different criticisms come together in the same story, aggravating the wrong committed. 
It is equally valuable, however, to understand the same story from the perspective of the 
victim, simply trying to deal with life events as they occur (with the press providing its own, 
sometimes monumental, challenges) or, in some cases, over a lengthy period of time, again 

49

A2.3 

2.4 

2.5 

and again having to confront different attacks from the same or different quarters. To tell 
every story was simply impractical but to say (as is frequently asserted) that the Inquiry has 
been ‘hijacked’ by celebrities is both wrong and unfair; the claim may be thought to be an 
attempt to divert attention away from the real harm caused to real people.

The second purpose of the Report is to set out my conclusions on the culture, practices and 
ethics of the press and the other areas of my Terms of Reference. It is also to identify and 
explain my recommendations as to the way forward: that, after all, is precisely what the Terms 
of Reference require me to do. Both conclusions and recommendations appear throughout 
the Report but are, I hope, reasoned and comprehensible.

The  third  purpose  of  the  Report  is,  in  my  view,  the  most  important.  It  is  to  allow  those 
who read it to reach their own conclusions about every aspect of the Terms of Reference. 
From the outset (and consistently the subject of commentary throughout the hearings and 
subsequently), it has been suggested that a judge is wholly unsuited to the task of seeking to 
discern, let alone determine, how a free press should operate and how it should exercise its 
rights of free speech. It has been said that I have had an agenda and that the failure to involve 
a journalist with tabloid or mid-market experience as an assessor demonstrates a failure to 
understand the popular culture of journalism and an attempt to impose a broadsheet agenda 
when the profitable newspapers are the former not the latter. It is argued that the Terms of 
Reference are either too broad or too narrow. It is open to all to reach their own conclusions.

I have no doubt that all sections of the press will report and comment upon this Report, each 
newspaper or title from its own perspective. It will be for anyone who reads the Report to 
decide the extent to which any comment upon it is fair in the same way that it will be for the 
Government (maintaining, I hope, the cross party consensus with which this Inquiry was set 
up) to decide how far it wishes to take the recommendations that I have made. That is where 
the ultimate decision making properly lies.

3.	 Timing	and	content
3.1 

It is also necessary to say something about the timetable. Although the Prime Minister initially 
hoped that the Report would be available within 12 months, two developments affected the 
prospect of such a time frame being met. The first was the extension, beyond that initially 
envisaged, of the Terms of Reference. More significant, however, was the appreciation that 
there  was  no  body  of  evidence  immediately  available  to  provide  the  basis  from  which  to 
commence the calling of witnesses; the police investigation was ongoing and therefore it was 
not appropriate to seek to use the evidence that had been collected during that inquiry. Thus, 
it was only possible to start the collection of evidence in August 2011 and, given the holiday 
period, it was inevitable that it would take some time to be prepared; only after it had been 
prepared and served could it be assimilated and the hearings commenced.

3.2 

In the event, the oral hearings commenced on 14 November 2011 and, had it been essential 
to deliver a Report by the end of July 2012, they would have had to have been concluded 
by April. Given the remit involving the press, the public, the police and politicians, this was 
simply not feasible. I therefore set different targets namely that the evidence should conclude 
within about 12 months of the appointment of the Inquiry and the Report should be available 
within about 12 months of the commencement of the evidence. I did so because I recognised 
the fundamental importance of early delivery of a Report so that decisions could be made 
and implemented as to the future within a reasonable timetable, rather than being pushed 
back thereby falling in the run up to a general election.

50

PART A | The InquiryAChapter 4  |  The Report

3.3  Meeting the timetable has not been without consequences. In relation to the evidence, careful 
selection was made of those witnesses who would be called to give evidence on oath and 
representations were invited from Core Participants in relation to other potential witnesses 
whose statements, in the absence of objection, could be read into the record without their 
personal attendance. Understanding the approach of the Inquiry to the evidence generally, 
sensible decisions were made by the Core Participants whose assistance, throughout, has 
been of very great value. The consequence, as I have explained, is that a vast body of evidence 
was not in fact the subject of oral exposition and the timetable for the hearings was met. 
There are, however, no different classes of evidence: although some of the material provided 
in writing is not referred to, it has all been considered.

3.4 

As for the Report, the consequences are different. In an ideal world, I would have wished to 
write, re-write and hone this Report so that every nuance could be the subject of mature 
reflection. As previous inquiries have shown, given the amount of evidence whether oral, 
documentary or read-in, that would have been a task of very many months duration. This 
Report, therefore, is the work of many hands,1 all working to my direction and reflecting my 
views; that is the inevitable consequence of the way in which the work has had to be done. 
I place on record my appreciation to all those who have collated the evidence in relation to 
different aspects of the Report. Having said that, I repeat that every finding of fact, every 
conclusion and every recommendation expressed in this Report is mine alone. Equally, any 
errors are my responsibility. 

1  That is to say, I have been assisted in the drafting by Counsel and by civil servant members of the Inquiry team;  the 
Assessors have been invited to provide comments on drafts only where appropriate.

1.2 

This Part of the Report alludes to some of the fundamental principles which must provide 
the context for any consideration of the role of the press in the United Kingdom. It does so 
principally for the purpose of brief overview and explanation, and to set the scene for the 
narrative, analysis and recommendations which follow.

The principles which are set out are not simply derived from philosophical or jurisprudential 
writings. Proprietors, editors and journalists wrote and spoke about the importance of what 
they do for all of us in the UK, and the value it has for our common life. Politicians described 
the principles informing their own relationship with the media, including as policy-makers. 
Commentators suggested the matters that the Inquiry should  bear particularly  in  mind  in 
approaching its task. This brief overview seeks to distil, without necessarily fully rehearsing, 
the essence of the points of principle which were put before the Inquiry.

1.3  Without  seeking,  or  needing,  to  do  full  justice  to  the  fine  nuances  of  opinion  which  it  is 
possible to hold and debate about such matters, this Part of the Report aims simply to set out 
a framework of understanding which is relatively uncontroversial. It is therefore the intention 
simply to underline, to put beyond doubt, the extent to which the Inquiry has itself proceeded 
on the basis of the perspectives set out, and to do so in terms with which I believe that most 
of the public would be able broadly to agree.

1.4 

1.5 

1.6 

It is also the intention of this Part of the Report to clarify some of the strands of thought which 
have been woven through a great deal of the evidence the Inquiry has received. Concepts 
such as the freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the public interest have been 
much referred to in the course of the evidence. These are potent expressions, and powerful 
and important concepts; commensurate clarity and care is needed in their deployment in the 
context of a Report on the culture, practices and ethics of the press. They are concepts which 
are capable of being, and have been, used both rhetorically and analytically to explain and 
support a range of different perspectives, arguments and conclusions.

Attempting an all-embracing definition of concepts of this sort, even within the limitations 
of the Inquiry’s Terms of Reference, is neither necessary nor appropriate. Some measure of 
clarification is nevertheless attempted, both to underline the importance of these concepts 
and also to indicate the traps they can sometimes set for the unwary. This is not intended to 
make any claims to an especial authority in doing so, but only to give some indication of why 
they are important, and the limits of the uses and justifications to which they can be put. 
These are precious and fundamental principles, to which great respect must be paid; at the 
same time, they must be handled thoughtfully and with care.

The Inquiry was considerably assisted in this respect not only by the way that the issue has 
been put by so many journalists but, in particular by the expert witness evidence it received, 
in both written and oral form.1 I recognise that I have freely borrowed from their observations 
in some of what follows and I am grateful to them. In doing so and while acknowledging this 
debt, I should make clear, that the analysis set out here is entirely that of the Inquiry and 
is not to be taken to be representative of the entirety of the views of the expert witnesses, 
collectively  or  individually.  As  with  other  aspects  of  the  evidence  that  I  have  sought  to 
summarise,  I  can  only  commend  those  interested  to  the  original  evidence:  any  summary 
cannot attempt to do full justice to it.

1.  Context

“A  free  press  is  the  unsleeping  guardian  of  every  other  right  that  free  men  prize; 
it is the most dangerous foe of tyranny … Under dictatorship the press is bound to 
languish … But where free institutions are indigenous to the soil and men have the 
habit of liberty, the press will continue to be the Fourth Estate, the vigilant guardian 
of the rights of the ordinary citizen.”1

Winston Churchill

“The  proper  functioning  of  a  modern  participatory  democracy  requires  that  the 
media be free, active, professional and inquiring. For this reason the courts here and 
elsewhere, have recognised the cardinal importance of press freedom and the need 
for any restriction on that freedom to be proportionate and no more than necessary 
to promote the legitimate object of the restriction.”2

Lord Bingham

1.1 

The importance of a free press to democracy is surely incontrovertible, and, as Lord Bingham’s 
statement  makes  clear,  enshrined  in  law  and  constitution  in  the  UK.  Why  it  is  so  may  be 
thought obvious, but bears some consideration. The quality of that freedom also requires 
consideration; again, as Lord Bingham indicates, freedom has many components and is rarely 
in a democracy absolute or paramount, if only because democracy may itself be thought of 
as a system for reconciling competing freedoms. Equally, a press that is free and nothing else 
will not necessarily enhance democracy. Other conditions are necessary too; Lord Bingham’s 
formulation that the press must also be ‘active, professional and inquiring, and Churchill’s 
vision of the press as ‘vigilant guardians of the rights of the ordinary citizen’ raise interesting 
questions about how freedoms can be used.

1.2  My attention has been drawn by press Core Participants to statements of the highest judicial 

authority which develop these points in a variety of ways.

1.3 

In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Simms (2000) 2 A.C. 115, a case 
which held that any restriction on the interviewing of prisoners by journalists must be strictly 
justified, Lord Steyn explained at paragraph 126:

‘Freedom of expression is, of course, intrinsically important: it is valued for its own 
sake.  But  it  is  well  recognised  that  it  is  also  instrumentally  important.  It  serves  a 
number  of  broad  objectives.  First,  it  promotes  the  self-fulfilment  of  individuals  in 
society. Secondly, in the famous words of Holmes J (echoing John Stuart Mill), ‘the 
best of truth is the power of thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the 
market’: Abrams v US (1919) 250 U.S. 616, 630, per Holmes J (dissenting). Thirdly, 
freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy. The free flow of information and 
ideas informs political debate. It is a safety valve: people are more ready to accept

decisions that go against them if they can in principle seek to influence them. It acts 
as  a  brake  on  the  abuse  of  power  by  public  officials.  It  facilitates  the  exposure  of 
errors  in  the  governance  and  administration  of  justice  of  the  country:  see  Stone, 
Seidman, Sunstein and Tushnet, Constitutional Law, 3rd ed. (1996), pp. 1078-1086. 
It is this last interest which is engaged in the present case. The applicants argue that 
in their cases the criminal justice system has failed, and that they have been wrongly 
convicted. They seek with the assistance of journalists, who have the resources to 
do  the  necessary  investigations,  to  make  public  the  wrongs  which  they  allegedly 
suffered.’

1.4 

The point was developed in the speech of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in Reynolds v Times 
Newspapers Ltd (2001) 1 A.C. 127, at paragraph 200:

‘The high importance of freedom to impart and receive information and ideas has 
been  stated  so  often  and  so  eloquently  that  the  point  calls  for  no  elaboration  in 
this case. At a pragmatic level, freedom to disseminate and receive information on 
political matters is essential to the system of parliamentary democracy cherished in 
this  country.  This  freedom  enables  those  who  elect  representatives  to  Parliament 
to  make  an  informed  choice,  regarding  individuals  as  well  as  policies,  and  those 
elected to make informed decisions...Likewise, there is no need to elaborate on the 
importance of the role discharged by the media in the expression and communication 
of information and comment on political matters. Without freedom of expression by 
the media, freedom of expression would be a hollow concept.’

1.5 

The same point has been made with equal force in the European Court of Human Rights 
in Strasbourg. In Castells v Spain (1992) 14 EHHR 445 a senator of an opposition political 
party in Spain published an article in a weekly magazine critical of the government, and was 
charged and convicted of insulting the government and disqualified from holding political 
office. During the trial, Senor Castells attempted to adduce evidence as to the truth of the 
article, but it was declared inadmissible by the Spanish Supreme Court. The Strasbourg Court 
held that his conviction constituted an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of 
expression under Article 10 of the ECHR. At paragraph 43 the Court observed:

‘...the pre-eminent role of the press in a State governed by the rule of law must not 
be forgotten.
Although it must not overstep various bounds set, inter alia, for the prevention of 
disorder and the protection of the reputation of others, it is nevertheless incumbent 
on it to impart information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of 
public interest...
Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and 
forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders. In particular, 
it  gives  politicians  the  opportunity  to  reflect  and  comment  on  the  preoccupations 
of public opinion; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate 
which is at the very core of a democratic society.’

1.6 

The fundamental importance of the freedom of the press was a very familiar theme of the 
evidence  received  by  the  Inquiry,  and  rightly  so.  It  is  one  I  emphasised  myself  on  several 
occasions. The description of the importance of press freedom was put to the Inquiry largely 
in  two  forms:  first,  as  a  negative  or  ‘default’  argument  (any  interference  with  any  sort  of 
freedom must always be justified in a liberal democracy) and, second, as a positive argument 
(the press must be free to fulfil its important role). To the extent that either or both of these 

57

Chapter 2 | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy Barguments was deployed in the service of contentions about the right approach for the Inquiry 
to take to its Terms of Reference, and explicitly to the question of how far it might end by 
asking new things of the press in respect of its culture, practices and ethics, it is necessary to 
stand back and reflect on the origins and explanations for the importance of press freedom.

2.  a brief history of press freedom in the United 

2.1 

2.2 

2.3 

Kingdom
The history of the press is filled with struggles against the state and debates over the rights 
and privileges of the press. It thus provides an essential background to understanding the 
commitment  of  modern  democratic  society  to  freedom  of  the  press.  It  also  explains  the 
strength of feeling demonstrated by so many journalist witnesses.

From  the  advent  of  the  printing  press  in  1476  until  the  end  of  the  seventeenth  century, 
state licensing meant that the Government and the Church could control the press, and in 
particular  prevent  the  printing  of  seditious  or  heretical  works.  State  control  over  printing 
tightened when, in 1538, Henry VIII decreed that all new printed books had to be approved 
by the Privy Council and registered with the Stationers’ Company. This system of state control 
endured under a series of decrees issued and enforced by the Star Chamber.

The licensing regime ended with the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1640. However, in 1643 
licensing was reintroduced by Cromwell’s Parliament in an effort to suppress the publication 
of material about Charles I. This act moved John Milton to write his now immortal defence of 
the free press in The Areopagitica, a Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing:

“The attempt to keep out evil doctrine by licensing is like the exploit of that gallant man 
who thought to keep out the crows by shutting his park gate … Lords and Commons 
of England, consider what nation it is whereof ye are: a nation not slow and dull, but 
of a quick, ingenious and piercing spirit. It must not be shackled or restricted. Give me 
the liberty to know and to utter and to argue freely according to conscience, above 
all liberties.”

2.4  Milton’s plea went unheeded and for the next half century the press was governed under a 
licensing system which suppressed all but official publications. Licensing eventually ended in 
1695 when the House of Commons refused to renew the licensing legislation. Ever since the 
licensing of the press was abolished, there has existed a general right to publish newspapers, 
books or magazines without state authorisation.

2.5 

Although no longer required to obtain a licence for the mere act of publishing, there remained 
a number of restraints on the content of what the press could publish. The offences of criminal 
and seditious libel, for example, were still punishable at common law. In 1738, Parliament 
banned  reporting  in  print  of  the  proceedings  of  either  house  of  Parliament.  In  1712,  the 
Stamp Act introduced taxes on the press. These ‘taxes on knowledge’, intended to curb the 
radical press, created a culture in which journalists and newspapers subsisted through bribes 
and government subsidies.

2.6 

It took a century of campaigning by proponents of the radical press and free speech to secure 
further independence for the newspapers. Parliament ended the ban on press reporting in 
Parliament in 1771, after a legal battle by the radical MP and journalist John Wilkes against 
attempts  to  arrest  several  printers  for  reporting  parliamentary  debates.  The  Libel  Acts  of 

58

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB1792 and 1843, restoring the right to trial by jury and introducing a truth defence to the 
charge of seditious libel, provided the press with a measure of security against unmeritorious 
criminal prosecutions. Newspaper stamp duty was eventually abolished in 1861.

The repeal of newspaper taxes resulted in a period of rapid press expansion. However, by 
the  early  part  of  the  twentieth  century,  a  new  form  of  limitation  on  press  independence 
had emerged. The proliferation of both regional and national newspapers was followed by 
a period of consolidation as increasingly powerful newspaper chains bought up provincial 
titles. For much of the inter-war period the proprietors of these large corporations – the press 
barons of the day – dominated the press.

During the Second World War, Government censorship returned, this time in the guise of 
the now infamous Defence of the Realm Regulations. Regulation 2D conferred on the Home 
Secretary the personal power to ban any publication which published “material calculated 
to foment opposition” to the war. Relying on this power, the Government closed down two 
communist papers. Following mass rallies in response, the ban was lifted.

In  general,  however,  the  press  response  to  the  unprecedented  levels  of  Government 
censorship  which  characterised  the  war  period  was  muted.  Representative  of  the  type  of 
views being expressed on this issue, but not on others, George Orwell gave the following 
retrospective perspective:3

2.7 

2.8 

2.9 

“Any fair-minded person with journalistic experience will admit that during this war 
official censorship has not been particularly irksome. We have not been subjected 
to  the  kind  of  totalitarian  ‘co-ordination’  that  it  might  have  been  reasonable  to 
expect. The press has some justified grievances, but on the whole the Government 
has behaved well and has been surprisingly tolerant of minority opinions. The sinister 
fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.”

2.10  During the immediate post-war period, the growth in the power of a limited number of press 
organisations increased. Growing concern over the dominance of a small group of proprietors 
led to the establishment of the first Royal Commission on the Press:4

“with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and 
the  greatest  practicable  accuracy  in  the  presentation  of  news,  to  inquire  into  the 
control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the 
news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in 
control, and to make recommendations thereon.”

In  the  final  report,  the  Commission  recognised  the  potential  problem  presented  by  the 
concentration of newspaper ownership. The solution proposed by the Commission was the 
creation of a General Council of the Press:5

“to safeguard the freedom of the press; to encourage the growth of a sense of public 
responsibility and public service amongst all engaged in the profession of journalism 
[…]; and to further the efficiency of the profession and the well being of those who 
practise it”.

Chapter 2 | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy B2.11  Concerns about the continued diminution in press diversity led to the establishment in 1962 

of the second Royal Commission on the Press:6

“to  examine  the  economic  and  financial  factors  affecting  the  production  and  sale 
of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom, including 
(a) manufacturing, printing, distribution and other costs, (b) efficiency of production, 
and (c) advertising and other revenue, including any revenue derived from interests in 
television; to consider whether these factors tend to diminish diversity of ownership 
and  control  or  the  number  or  variety  of  such  publications,  having  regard  to  the 
importance, in the public interest, of the accurate presentation of news and the free 
expression of opinion”.

It found that the share of circulation controlled by the large proprietors had substantially 
increased; the leading three proprietors’ share of the national daily press amounted to almost 
90%. It severely condemned the General Council and urged reform. The industry eventually 
responded in 1974, when the Press Council was created to replace the General Council.

2.12  Notwithstanding  this  reform,  there  remained  major  concerns  about  the  need  to  protect 
editors and journalists from the control of proprietors. The third Royal Commission on the 
Press was established in 1974:7

“To inquire into the factors affecting the maintenance of the independence, diversity 
and  editorial  standards  of  newspapers  and  periodicals  and  the  public  freedom  of 
choice of newspapers and periodicals, nationally, regionally and locally.”

The  report  recommended  the  development  of  a  written  Code  of  Practice,  warning  “it  is 
unhappily certain that the Council has so far failed to persuade the knowledgeable public 
that it deals satisfactorily with complaints against newspapers”. The Press Council rejected 
this proposal.

2.13 

In 1989, the Government set up a Committee under Sir David Calcutt QC to investigate growing 
concerns over invasions of privacy by the press. The 1990 Calcutt Report recommended the 
establishment of a new Press Complaints Commission to replace the Press Council. The PCC 
was  established  in  1991  and  tasked  with  administering  a  new  Code  of  Practice.  Since  its 
inception, concerns have been voiced about the PCC. These developments (and, indeed, a 
fuller history of all these reviews) are described later in the report.8

2.14  Whilst attempts to achieve a functioning of system of self-regulation stalled, great strides 
were achieved in securing legal protection for a free press. Beginning in 1950, when freedom 
of  expression  was  enshrined  in  Article  10  of  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights 
(“the ECHR”), legal protections for the press have steadily increased. Although Article 10 is a 
protection for individual rather than corporate freedom of expression, and does not expressly 
refer to the press, press reportage has consistently been recognised in case law as protected 
speech. In this regard, the European Court of Human Rights has emphasised the pre-eminent 
role  of  the  press  in  a  democracy  and  its  duty  to  act  as  a  “public  watch-dog”.9  It  has  also 
recognised the importance of pluralism in the media, noting that “there can be no democracy 
without pluralism. Democracy thrives on freedom of expression”. 10

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB2.15  Consistently with other international instruments protecting freedom of expression, Article 
10 expressly acknowledges that freedom of expression generally, including freedom of press 
expression, may be restricted where necessary to protect the legitimate aims of a democracy. 
The court has recognised that freedom of expression may need to be restricted in the interests 
of national security and public morality, as well as individual rights to privacy and peaceful 
enjoyment of property. The ECHR jurisprudence has nonetheless afforded a broad degree of 
protection of the press, drawing a distinction, however, between the protection afforded to 
reporting contributing to debate on economic, social and political issues and press reports 
involving tawdry allegations about an individual’s private life.11

2.16  Since  2000,  Article  10  has  been  incorporated  into  domestic  law  through  the  mechanisms 
set out in the Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998. In the years since incorporation, the domestic 
courts have joined Strasbourg in seeking to strike a balance between the protection afforded 
a free press, the restrictions necessarily placed on that freedom in a democratic society.

2.17  This brief history makes a number of points about the values and functions of press freedom 
in democracy. First, the struggle to achieve press freedom (in the sense of freedom from the 
power of the State) was driven by the democratic value served by the press. Freedom of the 
press, according to this historical tradition, was and is celebrated not simply because of any 
intrinsic value of a free press, but because of the public benefits associated with free flow of 
information and debate.

2.18  Second, it is clear from this history that threats to the democratic function of a free press 
can  take  many  forms.  Government  licensing  and  censorship  of  content  is  the  most  easily 
identifiable  restriction  and  was  deployed  with  invidious  effect  in  the  seventeenth  and 
eighteenth centuries. The democratic freedom to own and operate a printing press in the first 
place is precious and hard won. However, as the more recent history of the struggle for press 
freedom illustrates, there are other sources of power which may threaten press freedom, 
and indeed other freedoms which may have a legitimate claim to being taken into account.

2.19  A  free  press  contains  within  itself  immense  power  to  promote  democratic  freedoms  and 
the public good. It also contains within itself the reverse potential, that is to say, to create 
undemocratic concentrations of power and undermine freedoms and the public good. The 
challenge  of  securing  the  democratic  benefits  of  a  free  press,  whilst  obviating  the  harm 
presented by the unchecked exercise of concentrated or unaccountable power, is the legacy 
of the historic struggle to free the press. Professor Baroness Onora O’Neill put the matter in 
this way:12

“I  think  if  we  just  say  we’re  in  favour  of  press  freedom,  we  beg  all  the  important 
questions. The important question is: which conception of press freedom and how do 
you justify it?”

3.	 The	importance	of	a	free	press:	free	communication
3.1  When confronting the challenge of securing a free press it is important to be clear about 
why we value a free press and what we seek to protect. Perhaps the most enduring and least 
contentious rationale for a free press is the argument that a free press contributes to the 

11 Application 36919/02 Armonienė v Lithuania (25 November 2008), para 39

61

Chapter 2 | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy Bfree flow of communications in a liberal democracy. This can be put in a very broad way, for 
example:13

“the public interest in … a free press is best construed as an interest in adequate (or 
better than adequate) standards of public communication, that allow readers, listeners 
and viewers to gain information and form judgements, and so as to participate in 
social, cultural and democratic life. A free press is a public good because it is needed 
for civic and common life.”

And:14

“a liberal public sphere, one in which every member, everyone in the community, can 
take part is just a very good thing in itself. It’s useful partly for the results it creates 
but it’s also a good in itself that we all have the status of being able to take part in 
the liberal public sphere and it seems the press plays a role in that. People who are 
insufficiently articulate or insufficiently confident to take part in the public speech, 
the press can give them a voice.”

3.2 

A number of serving editors have given the Inquiry the benefit of a perspective from the front 
line. Representative of such viewpoints was the reference by Alan Rusbridger to:15

“the simple craft of reporting: recording things; asking questions; being an observer; 
giving context. It’s sitting in a magistrates’ court reporting on the daily tide of crime 
cases – the community’s witness to the process of justice. It’s being on the front line 
in Libya, trying to sift conflicting propaganda from the reality. It’s reporting the rival 
arguments over climate change – and helping the public to evaluate where the truth 
lies.”

3.3 

3.4 

It is important to note that this is not just a general argument for the benefits of free self-
expression. Freedom for commercial mass media businesses (‘corporate speech’) is a very 
different proposition from the freedom of individual self-expression (‘personal speech’). The 
latter is discussed further below, and has its roots in a very personal conception of what it is 
to be human. Take, for example, John Stuart Mill’s argument from On Liberty, that freedom 
of speech serves a central function in promoting individual autonomy and self-fulfilment. This 
argument has no direct relevance to press freedom because, put simply, press organisations 
are  not  human  beings  with  a  personal  need  to  be  able  to  self-express.  In  any  event,  “an 
argument for free speech for the powerless will not make a case for free speech for a powerful 
organisation.”16

The general argument for a free press as a means of free communication, on the contrary, has 
to do with a number of different things. These include the ability to give a powerful voice in 
the public domain to those unable to do so effectively for themselves (perhaps of diminishing 
importance in the era of social media and self-expression on the internet). Importantly, it 
is also to do with the constitution by the media in their own right of a public forum, where 
information, ideas and entertainment are both circulated and held up to scrutiny. The essence

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestBof the importance of a free press is therefore not an interest in free ‘self’ expression but in 
free communication, the free flow of knowledge, information and ideas:17

“Readers,  listeners  and  viewers  don’t  need  media  that  ‘express  themselves’:  they 
need media that meet at least minimal standards for adequate communication with 
intended audiences.18
The critical public interest in a free press is not so much in a press which exercises 
self-expression as in a press that is free from censorship, not subject to some kind of 
central control.19
Even if the press does have a very important right to freedom of expression, you have 
to remember that it’s justified by what it does for individuals by constituting a public 
sphere in which all individuals can take part.”

3.5 

3.6 

3.7 

A free press will not necessarily provide an effective ‘market-place for ideas’. The freedom of 
the press is a prerequisite for that, but not sufficient in itself, for all sorts of reasons. There 
must  be  some  degree  of  effective  connection  between  communicators  in  the  press;  and 
when some elements of the press are more powerful communicators than other papers and 
individuals, its capacity to facilitate informed debate may be impaired. In a similar vein, a 
measure of plurality of voices is required if a free press is to enhance democratic debate.

The ‘argument from truth’, which identifies free speech as an important condition for the 
attainment of truth, is also not straightforward when applied to the press. Mill’s argument that 
society will benefit from “the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by 
its collision with error” may hold in relation to the battle between truth and falsity expressed 
by individuals (but even then, only in the sort of discourse which aims at the truth). However, 
it is less certain that truth will prevail in the encounter between individual and institutional 
speech, or between different forms of institutional speech. To put the matter bluntly, “there is 
nothing to stop a free press … from freely deciding to support corruption or to be involved in it. 
We cannot assume that a free press, or specific agents within a free press, will be motivated 
to provide the kind of content that is, in fact, in the public interest.”20

The fundamental point is that unlike freedom of expression for individuals, which has intrinsic 
merit as a form of self-expression, press freedom has value to some extent as an aspect of 
commercial freedom, and to some extent because of the functions it serves. In other words, 
freedom of the press is largely understood as an instrumental good, to be valued, promoted 
and protected to the extent that it is with the result that it is thereby enabled to flourish 
commercially as a sector and to serve its important democratic functions.

4.  The importance of a free press: public debate and 

holding power to account
There are two, more specific, strands to explanation for the importance of a free press in a 
democracy. They were explained to the Inquiry by different witnesses in these terms:

Chapter 2 | The Freedom of the Press and Democracy B“a free press serves the public interest instrumentally in two key respects:
– Constraining power: A free press is an important check on political and other forms 
of social power (corporate, individual). To achieve this end, the press requires not just 
freedom from interference with the form and content of what it says, but also the 
capacity to investigate and acquire information.
–  Enabling  democratic  deliberation  and  decision-making;  educating  and  enabling 
understanding.  A  free  press  –  especially  a  diverse  press  in  which  many  views  are 
represented – is an important forum for public deliberation and education, a means 
for enabling the public to engage in informed democratic decision-making.” 21
“there are also some very well-known instrumental benefits of the press. So it’s a very 
important check on political power and other forms of power. It’s an important source 
of education and an important means of enabling democratic decision-making.” 22
“The public interest in a free press lies largely in the character of our society as a 
liberal democracy. It is in the public interest that there be a free press because and 
insofar as such a press serves as a necessary bulwark against government duplicity 
or tyranny. A free press serves also to inform people about the principles under which 
they live and the policies which government adopts and pursues in their name. This 
is of particular importance in a democratic society where governments are elected by 
the people and act in the name of the people. The argument from democracy is, so 
to speak, a ‘guiding light’. Insofar as it reminds us of the most important purpose of a 
free press, it also, and at the same time, reminds us of the most significant duties of 
a free press – duties to communicate those things which people need to know if they 
are to be effective and informed citizens” 23
“The  serious  purpose  the  press  serves,  the  purpose  which  makes  it  critical  to  a 
genuinely  free  and  democratic  society  has  two  principal  components  –  to  inform 
citizens and to enable citizens to hold accountable those who should be serving the 
wider public.” 24
“A  free  press  can  communicate  important  facts  that  the  public  have  a  legitimate 
interest in knowing (and which others might want to conceal). …one aspect of the 
public interest in a free press is that it provides an essential set of checks and balances 
on power (and, more importantly, the abuse of power). …there is a public interest in 
learning of dangers and risks, even where others may wish to conceal them…. A free 
press, free of the censorship and restrictions imposed by the powerful, … serves the 
public interest by its investigative and communicative role. Both roles are necessary.” 25

4.2 

First,  therefore,  a  free  press  serves  democracy  by  enabling  public  deliberation.  Citizens 
need information to make intelligent political choices. To this end, the press serves both as 
a  conduit  for  the  dissemination  of  information  as  well  as  a  forum  for  public  debate.  It  is 
therefore unsurprising that the proliferation of newspapers which followed the abolition of 
the stamp duty in the nineteenth century was accompanied by one of the most active periods 
of political reform in modern history.

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB4.3 

4.4 

The second way in which a free press serves the interests of democracy is through its public 
watchdog role, acting as a check on political and other holders of power. The press is able to 
perform this function because of its hard-won position as a powerful institution independent 
of  the  state,  a  position  which  earned  it  the  nickname  or  sobriquet  of  the  Fourth  Estate 
amongst nineteenth century writers.

The  British  press  has  a  strong  tradition  of  holding  power  to  account.  A  forerunner  of 
investigative journalism, Charles Dickens, exposed some of the cruellest aspects of Victorian 
society in his excoriating accounts of the work houses. More recently, investigations conducted 
by his modern counterparts at The Daily Telegraph resulted in the exposure of widespread 
misuse  of  the  parliamentary  expenses  scheme  by  Members  of  Parliament.  Less  headline 
grabbing, but of equal significance, is the role of investigative journalism in consumer affairs 
and at exposing abuses of power in publicly-run institutions such as hospitals, care homes 
and prisons.

4.5 

Again, it is not a given that a press which is simply free will perform this function. The press 
must be independent from those in power and must be afforded the privileges necessary 
to  enable  investigative  journalism  to  take  place.  It  must  also  be  ‘active,  professional  and 
inquiring’.

5.  press freedom within the rule of law and the role of 

5.1 

5.2 

statute
The  unique  power  wielded  by  the  press  plays  a  vital  function  in  democracy.  However, 
this power must also be used consistently with other democratic values. A free press in a 
democracy must therefore operate within certain parameters.

Chief amongst these is the requirement that press freedom promotes, and operates within, 
the rule of law which itself is often described as the cornerstone of a democratic society.26 
Although the democratic function of the rule of law is primarily associated with the idea of 
government in accordance with the law, the doctrine’s deeper implications concern the need 
for accountability and constraint of all power in a modern democracy:

“Be you never so high, the law is above you” 27

5.3 

Lord Bingham encapsulated this essential function of the rule of law in his now celebrated 
monograph on the subject, in which he defined the rule of law as follows:28

“[A]ll persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private, should be 
bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly and prospectively promulgated 
and publicly administered in the courts.”

In other words, the rule of law is at the cornerstone of democracy because it protects the 
freedoms on which democracy depends, including press freedom, from arbitrary power.

5.4 

In a modern democracy that abides by the rule of law, press freedom can never mean a press 
which sits outside, above and beyond, or in disregard of, the law. Respect for the law is the 
common framework within which the press, as an important commercial sector, is enabled 

26 As a fundamental constitutional principle, the rule of law is now recognised in statute: see s 1 of the Constitutional 
Reform Act 2005

5.8 

to  flourish,  to  preserve  and  enjoy  its  freedoms,  and  to  make  its  unique  contribution  to  a 
democratic society.

That general principle relates to the law (both common law and statute) which applies to 
press organisations in the same way as it applies to other commercial organisations; these 
include the laws of taxation, for example, and, where relevant, the requirements of company 
or trust law. It also applies to the law which is of particular application to the activities of 
the  press,  specifically  including  information-gathering  and  publication.  Appendix  4  to  the 
Report  sets  out  the  principal  sources  of  law  applying  in  this  more  activity-specific  way  to 
press organisations. Some of this law is of particular, or modified, application to the press; 
whether or not that is the case, in many ways it does constrain the conduct (or ‘freedom’) of 
the press in order to hold it in balance with other important aspects of the public interest. 
How it does so is considered more fully below.

The  point  of  paramount  importance  for  present  purposes,  however,  is  that  there  is  a 
fundamental public interest in respect by the press for and obedience to the law. A press 
considering itself to be above the law would be a profoundly anti-democratic press, arrogating 
to  itself  powers  and  immunities  from  accountability  which  would  be  incompatible  with  a 
free society more generally. All who have the privileges and responsibilities of holding power 
to account, including police, politicians and press, must themselves champion and uphold 
the accountabilities they proclaim for others. The rule of law, in other words, ‘guards the 
guardians’ and is a guarantor of the freedom of the press, not an exception to it.

Reference has already been made to the separate public interest in a press which is diverse. 
Even if newspapers are, as editors have forcefully suggested, merely the passive conduits of 
their readers’ views, the argument for a multiplicity of such views is clear. To the extent that 
the press does more, and is capable of influencing public opinion, the argument becomes 
even  stronger.  These  arguments  are  recognised  in  general  terms  by  plurality  and  media 
specific competition laws, which apply both to the print and broadcast media. Of course, I 
fully appreciate that plurality and partisanship are separate concepts; that the print media 
is  fully  entitled  to  be  partisan;  and  that  the  broadcast  media  is  required  to  be  impartial. 
The simple point I am making about the press is that an irreverent and opinionated print 
media should, taken as a whole, reflect a range of views if it is fully to realise its potential to 
contribute to the public interest.

From this brief overview, it is possible to see that the organisation, activities and products of 
the press are in many ways limited by, or made accountable through, the operation of the 
law, that is to say, both common law and statute. In this, the press is no different from any 
other provider of, or participant in, democratic public life. As explained above, the rule of law 
is at the most fundamental level the guarantor of the freedom of the press, not an exception 
to it. And where it limits the activities or the press, or makes the press formally accountable 
for its actions, the law is simply performing its inherent democratic functions of balancing 
competing freedoms and competing public goods. So much is to state the obvious.

5.9 

That it needs to be stated at all, and more than stated, emphasised, is a result of two lines of 
argument put to the Inquiry, both of which are dealt with more fully below.

5.10  The first of these is the proposition that the press is, or should be, ‘entitled’ to break the law 
where to do so would be ‘in the public interest’. It is certainly true that there are a number 
of modifications in various aspects of the law applicable to the press which gives it greater 
latitude  within  the  law  than  is  afforded  to  others.  But  that,  emphatically,  does  not  mean 
recognition  within  the  law  that,  as  a  matter  of  general  principle,  the  press  possesses  any 
entitlement or expectation to be indulged, in the national interest, in special exemption from 

66

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestBobserving the requirements of the law. The Inquiry has been asked to consider the possibility 
of recommending that a general public interest defence be accorded to journalists in relation 
to what might be described as the whole of the criminal law insofar as it relates to the press. 
I give this proposal full and independent consideration.29

5.11  The other reason to clarify that a free press within a mature democracy operates within the 
rule of law is to address the line of argument, put to the Inquiry from time to time, that a 
statutory framework for, or underpinning of, press standards would by itself be repugnant to 
a proper view of the freedom of the press. This argument, in turn, appeared in two distinct 
forms.

5.12  The first version of this argument posits that any change to the law by Act of Parliament to 
require or restrict any behaviour by the press, or to increase its accountabilities, regardless of 
the content or justification of any such change, is intolerable in a democracy as an act of state 
control. I understand this argument, but believe that it completely lacks merit. It seems to 
rely, at some level, on a mistaken conflation of state censorship with the ordinary democratic 
processes of making and applying statute law.

5.13  As  has  been  illustrated,  there  are  many  forms  of  statute  law  which  already  restrict  the 
activities of the press, whether in terms of their organisation, competition or activities up 
to  and  including  in  limited  cases  what  it  may or  may not  be  lawful  to  publish  (race hate, 
for example). On the face of it, these statutory restrictions are legitimate and proportionate 
exercises  in  democratic  lawmaking,  balancing  competing  public  freedoms  and  goods.  Of 
course, as such, they need to be justified, and considered on their merits. Not every statutory 
restriction possible will be proportionate and justifiable. But to contend that no statutory 
reform could be so is to push the argument far beyond any reasonable statement of principle. 
Ultimately, there is no necessary connection between statutory underpinning of a regulatory 
system (to apply the argument more closely to home), on the one hand, and state censorship 
on the other, nor in my view is there some sort of slippery slope gliding from the first to the 
second.

5.14  The  second  variant  of  the  argument  is  more  limited.  It  is  put  by  witnesses,  such  as  Lord 
Hunt, on the basis that any proposal for statutory reform of the law as it applies to the press 
contains within it a risk of exposure to a Parliamentary process in which a commitment to 
the importance of press freedom does not at present exist.30 There are two objections to 
this argument. The first is that I am aware of no empirical evidence to support it.31 On the 
contrary, in recent years there are, I think, examples only of Parliamentary law making in 
respect of the press which is clearly focused on strengthening, rather than restricting, the 
freedoms of the press.32

5.15  The second objection is an objection of principle and constitution. More than one view is no 
doubt possible of how the freedoms of the press should best be held in balance with other 
freedoms  and  public  goods.  Parliament  is  the  proper  and  legitimate  forum  within  which 
such views can and must be debated in a democracy. If the press fears for its liberties in a 
Parliamentary context, its answer is to ensure that the case is put with maximum clarity in 
that forum, not to seek to avoid the forum altogether.

the press
A free press is able to perform valuable functions which individual free speech cannot. It is 
because of the position of the press as an institution of power that it is able to stand up to and 
speak truth to power. The professional skills and resources at its disposal enable the press 
as an institution to carry out ground-breaking investigations in the public interest. It is these 
considerations and functions which have resulted in the press as an institution being afforded 
certain privileges going beyond those protected by freedom of speech.

Principal amongst these is the press privilege not to disclose sources of information. Now 
enshrined in section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, the privilege means that a publisher 
cannot be compelled to reveal the source of published information unless a court considers 
such  disclosure  to  be  in  the  interests  of  justice  or  national  security  or  for  the  prevention 
of  crime.  The  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence  Act  (PACE)  1984  confers  a  similar  procedural 
privilege,  preventing  the  police  from  access  to  journalistic  material  without  authorisation 
obtained by application to the court. Furthermore, the courts have also recognised the right 
not to disclose sources as an important facet of the free press, as is reflected in the following 
words of Lord Woolf CJ:33

“The fact that journalists’ sources can be reasonably confident that their identity will 
not be disclosed makes a significant contribution to the ability of the press to perform 
their role in society of making information available to the public”.

Furthermore, whilst the press are not above the law, the criminal law does on occasion accord 
journalists a form of protected status34 as well as certain protections in relation to otherwise 
defamatory publications (e.g. qualified privilege and the ‘Reynolds’ defence). These matters 
are all covered in some detail later in the report and stand to be enhanced in the Defamation 
Bill  presently  before  Parliament.  Suffice  to  say,  these  privileges  afforded  to  the  press  are 
important precisely because they enable the press to serve the public interest in carrying out 
investigative journalism and disseminating information: they are not afforded for any other 
reason.

CompETINg pUBLIC INTErESTS

1.  Context
1.1 

The public interest in a free press is fundamental. But it cannot be viewed in isolation. As has 
been demonstrated, it is, itself, an aspect of wider public interests such as the public interest 
in democracy, for example, in public life and in the rule of law. There are other public interests 
also of which press freedom is not a major aspect, and with which it may sometimes be in 
tension. This section considers some of them, in order to put the public interest in a free 
press in its fuller context, and to reflect on how competing aspects of the public interest are 
resolved and reconciled.

1.2 

1.3 

The ‘public interest’ is therefore not a monolithic concept. Nor is it the particular property 
of  the  press  or  any  other  organisation  or  sector.  It  will  often  be  a  matter  of  balancing  a 
number of outcomes which would be for the common good, but which cannot all be achieved 
simultaneously. In a democracy, this is principally a role for Government that is, for example, 
used to grappling with a balance between the public interests in public spending and in low 
taxes, in liberty and in security, in high accountability and low bureaucracy.

That is by no means to portray any aspects of the public interest as mutually exclusive or zero-
sum. On the contrary, the fact that many aspects of public, and indeed private, life may benefit 
the public makes the task of the decision-maker a much more subtle and skilful one than 
that. There are critical decisions to be taken about how to balance, weigh and reconcile many 
things that are in themselves good but not all of which may be simultaneously achievable. So 
it is a complex task for those charged with it, and one for which accountabilities are rightly 
demanded. A wider perspective than that of the press is therefore inevitable:1

“There are more components of the public interest than those that are served by a 
free press, so that the press may need to control its activity to respect those wider 
factors. … Sometimes it seems that the press’s confidence that its activities are serving 
the public interest makes it insensitive to the complexity of that notion.”

1.4  Most proponents of free speech, for example, accept that its exercise must be restricted in 
order to protect the rights and interests of others. There is an important public interest in 
free speech, and there is also an important public interest in the civil liberties of individuals. 
These may sometimes need to be reconciled. Certain acts of speech, such as speech inciting 
violence or race hate, are so connected with producing specific conduct as to be relatively 
unprotected. Even Milton, in a passage from the Areopagitica overshadowed by his rhetoric 
in  defence  of  a  free  press,  acknowledged  necessary  limits  to  free  speech  (although  not 
necessarily limits which we would now condone):

“I mean not tolerated popery, and open superstition, which as it extirpates all religious 
and civil supremacies, so itself should be extirpate … that also which is impious or evil 
absolutely against faith or manners that no law can possibly permit that intends not 
to unlaw itself”.

1.7 

Some  of  those  who  place  the  strongest  emphasis  on  press  freedom  take  their  lead  from 
the  principally  American  brand  of  ‘free  speech  absolutism’.  Free  speech  absolutists  take 
the  injunction  of  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitutions  at  face  value: 
that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. Within this tradition, the 
United States Supreme Court has developed some of the most extensive protections of free 
speech in the democratic world, including the protection of religious and racist hate speech 
as a species of ‘political speech’.2

However, even in a culture committed to maximum protection to free speech, the absolutist 
position  has  proved  impossible  to  sustain.  In  practice,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court 
imposes  extensive  restrictions  on  freedom  of  speech  by  identifying  categories  of  speech 
which are deemed not to fall within the scope of the First Amendment. These categories 
include for example advocacy of imminent illegal conduct, official secrets, defamation and 
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Supreme Court has also denied that certain categories of 
sexually explicit material amount to protected speech and has been prepared to sanction far 
more extensive restrictions of obscene material than exist in the UK.3

Article 10(2) of the ECHR itself permits “formalities, conditions or restrictions” on freedom of 
expression so long as they are prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society. Thus, 
to the extent that press freedom is protected as an aspect of the protection of freedom of 
expression under Article 10, certain restrictions will be necessary and justifiable in the overall 
public interest.

1.8 

The Inquiry invited thoughts on the place of press freedom within a wider concept of the 
public interest by asking the following question, both of some of the expert witnesses and 
more generally of the public at large via the Inquiry website:4

In order to maximise the overall public interest, with what other aspects of the public 
interest would freedom of expression, or freedom of the press, have to be balanced 
or limited? The Inquiry is particularly interested in the following, but there may be 
others:

a.  the interest of the public as a whole in good political governance, for example 

in areas such as:
–  national security, public order and economic wellbeing,
–  the  rule  of  law,  the  proper  independence  and  accountability  of  law 

enforcement agencies, and access to justice, and

–  the  democratic  accountability  of  government  for  the  formation  and 

implementation of policy;

b.  the  public  interest  in  individual  self-determination  and  the  protection  and 

enforcement of private interests, for example
–  privacy,  including  (but  not  necessarily  limited  to)  the  rights  to  privacy 
specified  in  general  in  Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human 
Rights  and  in  European  and  national  legislation  on  the  protection  of 
personal data,

–  confidentiality,  the  protection  of  reputation,  and  intellectual  and  other 

property rights, and

individual  freedom  of  expression  and  rights  to  receive  and  impart 
information  where  those  interests  and  rights  are  not  identical  to  the 
interests and rights of the press.

What follows picks up some of the strands of thought in the responses the Inquiry received 
to these questions, and which seemed to be particularly pertinent.

2.  freedom of expression
2.1 

As noted above, the rights of individuals to freedom of expression have different origins from 
the public interest in the free speech of the press. Thus, freedom of expression or speech 
has value for individuals because of its ability to contribute to individual self-expression and 
self-realisation.5

“Freedom of individual expression is important for the development and maintenance 
of  social  identity,  and  for  forming  relationships  and  associations,  for  developing 
projects (that may be counter to prevailing opinion or orthodoxy).”

2.2 

There is a distinct public interest in individual freedom of self-expression. Liberal democracies 
are composed of individuals free to express and develop themselves. It was put to the Inquiry 
in this way:6

“Freedom  of  thought  and  expression  are  also  in  the  public  interest  because  they 
constitute  the  public  as  a  society  of  equals  who  respect  one  another:  a  society  in 
which each member can participate and bring their own views to the public sphere. 
This is a good independent of the instrumental benefits it brings.”

2.3 

The public interest in individual freedom of expression is a distinct and different aspect of 
the public interest to press freedom. Here is one way in which the difference was explained:7

“The press has, as it were, no ’self’ to fulfil, so an argument from self-fulfilment or 
self-development will not be directly relevant to questions of press freedom. More 
importantly, however, demands for press freedom are not (or not centrally) demands 
for free expression, but rather for the communication of information, and even if we 
think that individuals need to be able to express their views in order to develop fully 
as human beings, it does not follow that extensive freedom should be extended to 
those (eg the press) whose primary concern is with communication of information. To 
put the point starkly, those who aim to communicate must aspire to standards which 
are inapplicable for those who aim only to express their own views.”

2.4 

The democratic rationale for freedom of expression in relation to individuals is also different 
from the democratic interest in a free press. It encompasses the individual’s right to receive 
information, impart his or her own views and participate in democracy on an informed basis. 
Democracy benefits from a free press where the press, taken as a whole (a sum of partisan 
parts), communicate a plurality of views and provide a platform for public debate.

Chapter 3 | Competing Public Interests B2.5 

In this context, mass communication by the press has the capacity both to enhance and inhibit 
individual  freedom  of  expression.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  bear  in  mind  the  important 
point made to the Inquiry that some limitations to freedom of expression under the law are 
necessary in order to protect free speech from being inhibited by the free speech of others. 
This is a significant issue when there is an imbalance of power between the competing voices. 
A free debate cannot happen if some participants simply drown out others and prevent them 
from speaking. As the New Zealand Law Commission pointed out in its submission to the 
Inquiry:8

“[C]ensorship  is  not  the  only  enemy  of  free  speech.  Those  who  exercise  their  free 
speech to intimidate, bully, denigrate and harass others on the internet lessen the 
credibility of free speech arguments. Even though the web provides those who are 
harmed by free speech the opportunity to exercise their right of reply, not all have the 
courage or the standing to exercise it. In effect, those who exercise their free speech 
rights  to  cause  harm  may  inhibit  others  from  participating  freely  in  this  vital  new 
public domain”.

2.6 

Such restrictions may be necessary to protect the freedom of expression of one individual 
or group of individuals from the speech of another individual or group of individuals. For 
example, speech which inhibits personal self-expression, be it artistic, religious or sexual, or 
which intimidates others into silence, inhibits freedom of expression of others. This is why 
society does not protect racial or religious hate speech in law.9 Nor is there protection in law 
for speech which is threatening, intimidating or harassing.10

2.7  When one individual’s right to freedom of expression is inconsistent with the similar rights of 
another, a difficult balancing exercise must be carried out in law. It may also be necessary to 
balance the public interest in the free speech of the press against the public interest in the 
freedom of expression of individuals. Race hate would be no more protected in the pages 
of a newspaper than it would anywhere else. This is, of course, a straightforward example. 
Political philosophers and ethicists would say that more complex issues arise where individual 
freedom of expression is put under pressure by the free speech of others in ways which are 
not objectionable in law but which nonetheless might be objectionable on other grounds.

2.8 

There are, for example, those cases in which the free speech of one party is experienced in a 
very intimate way as a threat to the core self-expression and identity of another. That is the 
context, for instance, in which debates about the portrayal of women and some minorities in 
the press is conducted.11 There is a public interest in the free expression of views (and images) 
which some, perhaps many, find objectionable. There is also a public interest in the liberty 
of  individuals  to  live  free  from  publicly  promulgated  stereotyping  which  limits  their  own 
expression and development of themselves. This is not in any sense a point about censorship 
or law. It is a very simple and self-contained point about competing public interests in free 
expression.

To this extent, the public interest in individual freedom of expression is an aspect of a broader 
public interest in the autonomy, integrity and dignity of individuals. More generally, personal 
autonomy and human dignity require that individuals enjoy a protected personal sphere over 
which  they  exercise  a  measure  of  autonomous  control.  This  is  a  dimension  to  the  public 
interest which has a very ancient history in the UK and a special place in public imagination. 
It underlies the iconic status of habeas corpus as an early guarantee of personal liberty, and it 
underlies the special importance of freedom from interference in home life: ‘an Englishman’s 
home is his castle’.

3.2 

Personal autonomy means that individuals must have a sphere in which they can exercise 
individual  choices  without  interference  from  others  (including  the  state).  This  important 
personal  sphere  has  been  described  in  Western  liberal  philosophy  in  terms  of  the  public 
interest in personal privacy. As David Feldman has stated:12

“The combination of the idea of a right to be respected as a moral agent with the 
idea of social spheres of decision-making within which people or groups are entitled 
to regard themselves as free from outside coercion are, I suggest, of the essence off 
the notion of privacy as a civil liberty.”

3.3 

3.4 

3.5 

It  is  evident  and  well  evidenced  that  the  public  interest  in  free  speech  and  free  self-
expression does, on occasion, come into tension with the public interest in individual privacy 
and autonomy. Both are protected in law. Article 10 of the ECHR (freedom of expression) is 
held in a dynamic balance with Article 8 (home and private life). This dynamic balance has 
been  developed  in  the  English  law  of  the  protection  of  privacy.  Lord  Hoffmann  observed 
in  Campbell  v  MGN  Ltd  that  the  protection  of  privacy  was  essential  to  “the  protection  of 
human autonomy and dignity – the right to control the dissemination of information about 
one’s private life and the right to the esteem and respect of other people”. In the same case, 
Lord  Nicholls  agreed  that  “[a]  proper  degree  of  privacy  is  essential  for  the  wellbeing  and 
development of an individual”.

Thus  the  existence  of  a  private  sphere  is  vital  for  human  development.  It  is  the  space  in 
which individuals are able to experiment with preferences and build personal relationships 
beyond public scrutiny and judgment. Violations of the private sphere prevent individuals 
from obtaining these benefits. The private sphere is also critical to personal autonomy as 
a space over which an individual exercises control. To invade someone’s privacy disregards 
that individual’s choices as to when and by whom he or she will be seen and what personal 
information he or she will divulge.

That element of choice and control of the personal sphere, although a fundamental public 
good, is also capable of being exercised contrary to the public interest. So, for example, where 
an individual seeks to draw a veil of privacy over his or her criminal conduct, then the public 
interest in privacy will come into conflict with the public interest in law enforcement. But 
even there, the balanced result will be a partial and not a complete invasion of privacy, and 
one which is carefully prescribed by law; even in prison there are basic guarantees of human 
dignity.

3.6  Where the public interest in free expression, in holding power to account, and in the pursuit 
of wrongdoing are all aligned on the one hand, and conflict with the public interest in an 
individual’s privacy on the other, it is clear that the balance will be able to come down in 

12 Feldman,D ‘Secrecy, Dignity or Autonomy? Views of Privacy as a Civil Liberty’, p54, http://clp.oxfordjournals.org/ 

73

Chapter 3 | Competing Public Interests Bfavour of the former. But again, it is important to keep in mind that the public interest in 
privacy, although compromised, never completely goes away. Violation of the private sphere 
must  always  be  proportionate  to  any  larger  public  interest  being  served.  The  element  of 
control over one’s personal life is never all-or-nothing, but a matter of an infinite number of 
degrees and decisions.

3.7  Where an individual has chosen to put a matter within the private sphere into the public 
domain, then he or she will have ceded a measure of control over it.13 Making choices of 
that nature is of the essence of personal autonomy. They do not necessarily imply that other 
choices will be made, much less that the freedom to make other choices is also being ceded. 
Everyone is entitled to some private space and always provided that there is no countervailing 
public interest in exposure of that private space (because, for example, it exposes crime or 
serious impropriety)14 there is a public interest in preserving it.

3.8 

This important point was made in a number of ways to the Inquiry.15

“An actor who is successful may be well known because his films are viewed by many. 
He may indeed wish and hope that many continue to view the results of his (and 
others’) craft. It does not follow from this that he has a pathological compulsion to 
display himself, or to have every aspect of his life observed and documented. Nor 
does it follow that he has made some kind of tacit contractual agreement, where he 
has waived his privacy rights in exchange for fame....
“Those who do wish to enter a quasi-contractual agreement where they exchange 
the protection of privacy for an increase in their fame should not be prohibited from 
doing so, but it does not follow from this that everyone that the public might have 
an interest in … should have their private lives placed at risk of intrusive and invasive 
acts.”16

3.9 

3.10 

To treat an individual merely as something to be talked about, reported or looked at against 
his or her wishes is contrary to the public interest in individual autonomy, and to the ethical 
imperative to treat individuals as an “end” and not simply as a “means”.

It is right to acknowledge however that the nature of the public interest in privacy and our 
understanding  of  the  implications  of  choices  made  by  individuals  about  their  privacy  are 
matters which lie at the heart of a number of fast-moving contemporary social changes, about 
which a clear and stable consensus may not yet have been reached. The explosion in use of 
social media, particularly by the young, has not yet been matched by a settled understanding 
of the implications of the choices that people make in placing private material online; many 
do so unwisely or naively with disproportionate exposure to exploitation of such material and 
the compromising of their privacy.

3.11  At the same time, the nature of commercial ‘celebrity culture’ continues to be pondered even 
as it evolves with great rapidity; again, there is as yet no settled understanding or consensus 
about this. A celebrity obviously gives up his or her right to privacy if he or she sells an intimate

as regards the transaction in question, but does that give the newspaper or even the press in 
general, a blank cheque for all purposes or for all time? Put in those terms, the answer, in my 
view, is clearly not. But around the margins there may be issues of fact and degree.

3.12 

In any event, while the precise limits of the public interest in this area may be being developed 
and contested, the underlying basics must not be lost sight of. As Professor Megone put it:17

“Journalists  and  editors  need  to  recognise  that  both  personal  privacy  and  the 
importance  of  confidentiality  can  in  part  be  understood  in  terms  of  an  agent’s 
ownership of his own information, and the importance of that to the control of his 
own life. These are matters a free society seeks to protect as part of the public interest 
– and the press need to be clear that they may well need respecting even when such 
respect adversely affects journalistic activity”

3.13  The protection of the “reputation and rights of others” is expressly identified by Article 10(2) 
of the ECHR as a necessary public interest basis for limiting the expression of others. The 
right to freedom of expression must therefore be accommodated with other fundamental 
liberties. Thus, when confronted with conflicting claims under two protected ECHR rights, the 
courts must undertake a difficult balancing exercise to determine which will prevail. This is the 
reason why there is no protection for speech (written or oral) which unjustifiably damages a 
person’s reputation or which interferes with a person’s “reasonable expectation of privacy”.18

4.  other public goods
4.1 

The relationship between freedom of the press and the public interest in justice is similarly a 
matter of balance. On the one hand, freedom of expression is integral to the principle of open 
justice, which encompasses the entitlement of the media to impart and the public to receive 
information in relation to the process of justice. Therefore, any restriction on the ability of the 
press to report proceedings openly must be expressly limited.19 On the other hand, reporting 
restrictions may be necessary if the right of an individual to a fair trial would be prejudiced 
by publication of information about the proceedings: this is no more than the protect the 
integrity of the justice system and a person’s right to a fair trial.

4.2 

Even  more  fundamental  are  the  limits  on  freedom  of  expression  necessary  to  protect  a 
democratic society in which freedom of expression is able to flourish. Thus, first listed in the 
restrictions on freedom of expression permitted by Article 10(2) are those “necessary in a 
democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, 
for the prevention of disorder or crime”. These are straightforward concepts which speak for 
themselves.

Chapter 3 | Competing Public Interests BCHapTEr 4 
THE rESpoNSIBILITIES of THE prESS

1.  Context
1.1 

The  idea  that  freedom  of  expression  comes  with  responsibilities  is  both  obvious  and 
entirely familiar. Article 10(2) of the ECHR provides that the right to freedom of expression 
“carries with it duties and responsibilities”. In part, this is because, as discussed in Chapter 3, 
unrestricted speech has the power to harm competing public interests, including the free 
speech of others. It is also because the press is an institution of considerable power and the 
exercise of power in a democratic context brings with it proportionate responsibility for the 
consequences of choices to do so. Moreover, where power is exercised purportedly in the 
public interest, then there is a particularly acute responsibility to account for the exercise of 
that power to the public in whose name it is exercised.

2.  press power and the impact on society
2.1 

In order to understand the responsibilities incumbent on the press, it is necessary to consider 
the nature of press power and the potential it has to impact on society. One obvious aspect 
of the power wielded by the press is its capacity for mass communication:1

“Mass communication has powers that local, individual, communication does not. 
Mass communication allows others to criticize, to inform of the failings, crimes, and 
deceit of the powerful. Mass communication allows agents to assemble, to unite, to 
form dissident movements, to organize and oppose those in power.”

2.2 

It is on account of this capacity of the press to communicate to large audiences, that the idea 
of the “megaphone effect” of the press was invoked with such frequency throughout the 
Inquiry. The megaphone effect of the press has a tremendous capacity to serve the public 
interest. It is because of the ability of the press to reach a wide audience that it is taken 
seriously by, and therefore able to stand up to, other institutions of power.2

“[O]ne aspect of the public interest in a free press is that it provides an essential set of 
checks and balances on power (and, more importantly, the abuse of power): in all too 
many parts of the world the state routinely tortures and murders its citizens, though 
reporting of such facts is strictly prohibited. This can help a vicious regime retain an 
air of legitimacy, or, in some cases, even to present the air of democratic legitimacy 
(there are putative democracies which have serious restrictions on press freedom). 
Similarly, the there is a public interest in learning of dangers and risks, even where 
others may wish to conceal them. A powerful industrialist might wish to conceal the 
fact that his factories are polluting the water supply, or that his company’s product 
is carcinogenic. A free press, free of the censorship and restrictions imposed by the 
powerful, thus serves the public interest by its investigative and communicative roles.”

2.3 

This power of the press to reach a wide audience, whilst having the capacity to do great good, 
carries certain risks:3

1 p2, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Witness-Statement-of-Dr-Neil-Manson.pdf

76

“Communication  is  a  relational  process,  taking  place  between  speaker  (or  writer) 
and audiences. A powerful media, even a powerful free media, can effectively block 
dissenting voices”.

Mass communication by the press can block dissenting voices in a number of ways. One is by 
preventing access to audiences. Access to audiences is integral to the ability of individuals to 
experience the communicative aspects of free speech:4

“Expression  can  be  done  by  a  lone  individual,  but  communication  is  essentially 
relational, and involves others. Individual speakers have an interest in being accessible 
to audiences. Communication can be stifled, not by blocking speech, but by blocking 
access to audiences. For example, suppose a cunning King permits dissenting political 
views to be expressed, but only at the bottom of a deep mine shaft. Though here, 
strictly speaking, one has an opportunity to express one’s views, one is not free to 
have them heard. Not only do we have an interest in there being an audience for our 
speech, we also have an interest in our being the audience to others’ speech.”

2.4 

Clearly,  if  a  particular  individual  or  group  of  individuals  are  denied  access  to  the  press  to 
promote their views, their ability to reach audiences is diminished:5

“Writers  of  such  columns  in  the  press  can  seek  to  mitigate  these  criticisms  by 
endeavouring to articulate what they take to be important or widespread lines of 
thought.  But  this  still  points  to  the  fact  that  in  terms  of  self-expression  the  press 
only allows a select few to promulgate their views. Although absence of censorship 
allows others to set up press outlets, in principle the resources required to do this 
effectively limit this opportunity. This argument could be taken further and it could be 
said that the public interest in freedom of expression can even be adversely affected 
by a free press, if certain other conditions hold such that some voices get much more 
prominence than others. In those conditions the power of the press as a medium of 
expression may lead to certain views dominating the public sphere and other views 
being squeezed out.”

2.5 

2.6 

One consequence is that views expressed through the press megaphone are more likely to 
predominate: “Whether something’s liable to be noticed, what effects it’s liable to have on 
other people’s perceptions must be very relevant”;6 “Financial power ensures that one sort of 
idea is more likely to be promoted in the newspapers people read than another sort of idea”.7

The  tendency  of  views  expressed  in  the  press  to  prevail  can  be  also  be  explained  by  a 
second, and related, facet of press power. There is no doubt that the press is considered 
a  voice  of  authority  in  society.  In  many  quarters,  it  has  rightly  earned  a  reputation  for 
accurate and vigorous reporting, independence and holding power to account. It is because 
of the authoritative quality of the press, combined with its access to mass audiences, that

Chapter 4 | The Responsibilities of the Press Bcommunication by the press, as an institution of considerable power, has a significant impact 
on society. It can set the news agenda, shape culture and change perceptions:8 9 10

“There is a great deal of difference between ‘a bloke down the pub’ claiming, to his 
fellow drinkers, that the MMR vaccine causes autism, and a broadsheet newspaper 
doing the same thing. Media institutions can shape public opinion, they can entrench, 
or change, public opinion in a way that individual speakers cannot.”

2.7 

The existence of a press with such significant power is a potent antidote to the dominance of 
big business and government; but it also has potential to do great harm if not exercised with 
responsibility:11

“If someone in a position of moral or political authority makes a statement about 
race or about gender, it isn’t simply that there will be a wider audience for that but 
also that the opinion comes with a greater degree of – with an imprimatur, or seems 
to, and that itself is problematic. That’s why positions of responsibility in society are 
very difficult, because you have to take a lot of care about what you say because 
people pay attention to it.”

2.8 

The press has the power to cultivate stereotypes, not just as a matter of the megaphone 
effect, but by cumulative effect also:12

“there is an asymmetry between the individual case and the case of the press. One 
of the reasons we tolerate the fairly broad-ranging right of individual expression is 
that individuals’ remarks are typically limited in their impact… But …this megaphone 
effect is a kind of culture-shaping effect … It exerts much greater influence and power 
on people, how they’re perceived by others, creating stereotypes or creating certain 
assumptions in society.” 13
“It  means  that  publications  in  the  press  are  peculiarly  vulnerable  to  promoting 
stereotypes, because it’s – what’s heard is widely heard. If it’s assumed that a member 
of a group is portrayed as a typical member of that group, then attitudes at large 
towards the group will be affected.” 14

3.	 Communication:	truth,	comment	and	‘assessability’
3.1 

The role of a free press as an agency of free communication (rather than of self-expression), 
of  constituting  a  public  forum  of  views  and  ideas,  is  an  important  one  to  focus  on.  The 
term ‘media’ implies both a conduit or market-place role (the means by which material is 
communicated) and also the freedoms of the press to comment, in a partisan way, on the

material that they publish (the message is editorially ‘mediated’). The vocal power and reach 
of the press, and its freedoms to mediate, are what make it a mighty force.

A free press performs its communication role in a democracy in a myriad ways, day in and 
day out. It is by no means only through political journalism and holding authority to account 
that the press proves its value in this way (although those are very important aspects in their 
own right). All forms of journalistic content potentially perform this vital role. Debate and 
comment,  information  and  speculation,  news  and  opinion,  education  and  entertainment, 
all  play  their  part.  It  is  exactly  this  multifunctional  and  multifaceted  package  of  content, 
produced with such verve and to deadline week in, week out, which makes the press such a 
marvel, such a matter of pride.

The  different  functions  of  the  press,  though,  have  different  implications.  We  care  about 
them in different ways and for different reasons. We apply different standards to them. So, 
for example, we might say we wanted the TV listings and football results to be ‘accurate’; 
the editorial to be ‘opinionated’ (perhaps to confirm or challenge, or help us form, our own 
opinions); the sports reporting to be ‘lively’ (and reasonably fair), the travel writing to be 
inspiring but not misleading, the crossword to be challenging but not impossible, and so on. 
And above all, we want it all to be accessible and a good read, as we all think of that in our 
different ways. This communication function is, in other words, an extremely complex and 
sophisticated exchange between editor and reader.

Nowhere is that more the case than in the role of the media in conveying news. It is here 
that both the demands and expectations of readers are particularly complex. We know that 
some news is more important than others, but we vary in our judgments about that. We 
want to know the facts, but we also want to know how people experienced them and what 
people think about them. We want the spirit as well as the letter of events – the emotion, 
the meaning, the drama, the implications. We have an instinct that different kinds of news 
should be communicated in different ways (a politician’s mistake, an outbreak of disease, a 
missing child, a disappointing new film, another rape in the town), but we will not find it easy 
to articulate those differences with any great precision.

3.5  We also know about the editorial inflection, the world-view, of the newspaper we read. For 
some, if not most, that is very much part of why it is their newspaper of choice. That does 
not mean we always agree with it. But we are familiar with it, and that familiarity is at some 
level part of the attraction. Newspaper readership is remarkably loyal. We want the news in 
the press to be true and accurate; we do not want to be misled or lied to. But we want, or are 
content for, it to be presented in a partisan way. We want a measure of balance and context, 
but we also want a perspective. We want the truth, but we understand that there are many 
versions of the truth, and incompleteness in all versions. Notwithstanding the emphasis put 
by both the industry and its critics on the difference between ‘fact’ and ‘comment’ these 
are by no means distinct and watertight categories. The very act of describing a fact is to 
comment on it. All forms of recording are selective.

3.6  What  authentic  communication  between  editor  and  reader  needs  in  these  circumstances 
is no more, but no less, than a measure of shared understanding of what is going on in that 
act  of  communication.  In  most  cases,  that  is  easy  and  obvious.  There  will  be  a  common 
expectation of complete accuracy in the TV listings; mistakes will irritate and inconvenience 
readers and ultimately drive them to look elsewhere. A newspaper urging readers to support 
a particular party in the run-up to a General Election can be expected to be more sympathetic 
to that party’s outlook and objectives than another’s, and to reflect that sympathy editorially 
elsewhere in its pages.

79

Chapter 4 | The Responsibilities of the Press B3.7 

But in some cases, it will be neither easy nor obvious for readers to orientate themselves in 
relation to material they read in the press. Some important examples were put before the 
Inquiry in the course of the evidence. They included, for example:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

science and health reporting, where most non-specialist readers cannot easily judge for 
themselves what experts are telling us;
consumer  journalism  such  as  property  or  travel  reporting  and  restaurant  reviewing, 
where we might not know whether a journalist has been an objective ‘mystery shopper’ 
or whether he or she has in fact been treated to holidays or meals by the organisations 
being reviewed, or owns a property in the same square as the house being praised in 
the newspaper;
‘PR’ journalism, in which what is effectively commercially-produced advertising material 
is reproduced as editorial without mediation at all;
the  reporting  of  identity  issues  (gender,  ethnicity,  sexual  orientation,  religion,  age, 
disability, appearance and so on) where the fact and manner of bringing such issues 
into coverage has a potential to implant a relevance for them in readers which they 
have not chosen.

3.8 

In  all  these  cases,  that  is  to  say  the  inaccessible  expertise,  the  conflicts  of  interest,  the 
subliminal, or the simply misleadingly incomplete, the reader cannot straightforwardly make 
up his or her mind about what the newspaper is saying. Professor Baroness Onora O’Neill, 
who gave the Inquiry her views as a leading expert in the field of public thinking on the role 
of the media, describes the need for readers to be able to ‘orientate’ themselves in relation 
to what they read as “assessability”. Mostly, readers know where they stand with what the 
papers say, and can make their own minds up about it. But not always. Where they cannot do 
so unaided, more is needed for the press to fulfil its proper role.

3.9 

This point about the importance of authentic communication by the press, which respects 
the needs of readers to be able to make their own minds up about what they are reading, was 
made to the Inquiry in a number of ways. Examples include:

“Those who aim to communicate must aspire to standards which are inapplicable for 
those who aim only to express their own views.” 15
“The public interest in a free press is not confined to the public interest in a press 
that reports matters of fact accurately and observes the disciplines of truth seeking 
needed  for  various  sorts  of  inquiry.  It  also  includes  an  interest  in  having  a  press 
that  communicates  other  sorts  of  content  –  eg  music  and  art,  puzzles  and  stories 
– that do not make truth claims. Nevertheless, where truth claims are made, there 
is  a  particularly  strong  public  interest  in  standards  of  media  communication  that 
meet the relevant requirements for truth seeking – accuracy about evidence and its 
limitations; distinctions between different sorts of evidence; the inclusion of necessary 
qualifications, and many others.” 16
“Good  public  interest  journalism  enables  the  public  to  judge  what  is  being  said. 
There may be cases where one has to hold back on the source of certain information,

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestBbut good public interest journalism seeks to make the sources and the evidence as 
available to the public as is feasible, given certain other constraints.”17
“I think the default in favour of openness is actually what good journalism does. They 
try to give the sources where they can. The difficulty about confidential sources is the 
problem that the reader has in knowing (a) was there any source at all and (b) was it 
a reliable source?”18
“One aspect of the public interest … is the public interest in truthfulness … Here there 
are two kinds of interest. There is the direct interest that individuals have in not being 
deceived or misled. …But there is also a second indirect interest in truthfulness, an 
interest in maintaining a culture of trust. If communication is believed to be untruthful 
(or inaccurate), then trust in communication may diminish.”19
“Simply  requiring  accuracy  or  truthfulness  does  not  preclude  a  free  press  from 
misleading, distorting, or, in some cases, from covertly serving or promoting vested 
interests.”20
“News  media  are  often  intermediaries.  They  play  the  role  of  communicating  facts 
that have been discovered, established or claimed by others. The evidence, warrant 
or other justification for such claims may be lacking, or suspect. The intermediary 
may not be competent to assess the claim, or have access to the evidence. They may 
be willing to pass on claims made by other self-interested parties in an uncritical way. 
…”21
“Knowing the source of a story is relevant to how we interpret it. Audiences’ reactions 
to an article on a ‘new wonder drug’ that ‘combats cancer’ might be less favourable 
if they knew that the copy was verbatim from a press release by the company making 
the ‘wonder drug’. Our response to ‘advertorials’ may (or at least ought to be) different 
from our response to news stories.”22
“With  regard  to  truthfulness  and  other  norms  of  communication,  the  arguments 
offered here are not that this or that claim ought to be made but rather, that the 
appropriate procedures and mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that what is 
said (whatever it is) is justifiable, assessable and evaluable with regard to its source. 
…  Ensuring  …communicative  adequacy  does  not  determine  or  constrain  content, 
except insofar as content is unjustified, misleading and untraceable.”23

4.  press ethics and the role of a code of ethics
4.1 

Press ethics, to which the Inquiry was directed by its Terms of Reference, can be understood 
at a simple level by reference to the choices available to a free press, where those choices 
may have consequences for the benefit or harm of others, whether individuals, groups or the 
public as a whole. These are the choices by which newspapers and journalists can exercise 
their freedoms so as to fulfil the unique and important role of the press in a democracy or

Chapter 4 | The Responsibilities of the Press Bindeed to undermine it, to promote or restrict public communication and debate, to enhance 
or harm civil liberties and the autonomy of individuals.

4.2 

4.3 

These are choices which fall to be made within the framework of the law. Compliance with 
the law (criminal, civil and regulatory) does not necessarily exhaust the ethical choices to 
be made by a free press, nor does consideration of legal risk and consequence exhaust the 
responsibilities of a press aiming at journalism in the public interest, which takes into account 
ethical risks and consequences.

The choices that a responsible and ethical press will make, then, flow from precisely those 
aspects of a free press which give it a unique role and privileges in a democracy, and from an 
awareness of its power to affect the public in general, and individual members of the public, 
for better or worse. The following are examples.

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

If a free press in a democracy has a special role in facilitating free communication and 
in  constituting  a  public  forum,  then  an  ethical  press  will  want  to  comply  with  good 
standards  of  communication.  It  will  want  to  enable  people  to  recognise  and  assess 
the material being provided. Where it provides information, that information will be 
reasonably intelligible and accurate.
If a free press in a democracy has special privileges to keep its sources secret, then an 
ethical press will be mindful of the reasons for and effects of that privilege and will 
exercise it only for those reasons, and bearing in mind those effects. It will want to 
ensure that the protection of sources is used to enhance the free flow of significant 
information and especially to protect those seeking to help hold power to account. It 
will not use it merely to constrain or control sources, nor will it abuse the privilege to 
mask the weakness or absence of sources or the existence of conflicts of interest, or to 
hide its own wrongdoing.
If a free press in a democracy has a special place because of its ability to hold power 
to account, an ethical press will consider itself to have responsibilities to do just that. 
It will not collude with the powerful at the expense of the public. It will challenge all 
kinds of sources of power, both public and private. It will be mindful of the power of the 
press itself, and seek to hold that power to account no less than other sources of power. 
And it will support others with responsibilities for holding power to account in doing so, 
including in the case of the media itself.
Further,  a  free  and  autonomous  press  within  a  democracy  will  be  mindful  of  the 
democratic freedoms and autonomies of others. All such freedoms and choices, after 
all,  stem from the same sources of  democratic authority and  accountability.  And  all 
ethical  systems  have  at  their  core  a  sense  of  respect  for  the  individuality  and  self-
determination of others.24 People are the stock-in-trade of journalism. An ethical press 
will therefore be especially mindful of the need to ensure that the individuals it deals 
with, both as sources of information and as the content written about, are treated as 
subjects and not objects, and both as subjects in their own right and as subjects in 
context, with families, connections and group identities which may be affected by the 
treatment of the individual.

4.4 

All of this is to re-emphasise that the freedom of the press, even the freedom of the press 
within the limitations and accountabilities under the law, is not enough by itself to secure 
the important democratic benefits for which press freedom is a prerequisite. To become an

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestBauthentically free press of the kind valued and privileged in a democracy, the press must also 
exercise its freedoms effectively for that purpose. It must actively choose that role and live 
out its implications. That point was made to the Inquiry in many ways; examples include:

“The duties or responsibilities of the press follow straightforwardly from the reasons 
we have for wanting a free press. So if one of the main reasons for wanting a free 
press is that we be fully informed as citizens, then there are responsibilities on the 
press to be accurate, honest, open and accountable.” 25
“Clearly though, a press which is free in the sense of not being controlled centrally, 
not censored, will only be meeting a necessary condition for serving its purposes of 
informing and scrutinising. In order for the press to serve these public interests it will 
also need to pursue its work with accuracy and rigour, to be concerned for the truth, 
to seek to avoid bias or serving particular interests, to make wise judgments as to 
what is worthy of public attention and what not, and perhaps to be courageous in 
pursuing these goals. (And it may well also be … that in order to serve its purpose the 
press needs to communicate in ways that are intelligible and assessable).” 26
“Freedom is not licensed, and that’s the way in which all these responsibilities bear 
on how you exercise your freedom. So you have those guiding aims of the media … 
– holding people accountable and presenting information – serving those roles and 
then these constraints.” 27
“The strategy here has been to focus on the valuable ends that a free press is meant 
to serve and then to point out (a) that a free press need not secure those ends; (b) 
that a free press can even stand as an obstacle to the achievement of those ends. 
This is not to argue in favour of censorship but to point out ways in which a free press 
can fail to contribute towards the public interest, and, as such, public-interest based 
justifications will fail to apply.” 28
“it is important for good judgment that the press is clear not only on the nature of the 
purposes it serves in a free and democratic society but on their partial contribution to 
public interest as a whole and the independent significance of other components of 
the public interest. … In my view the press itself at present assumes too quickly that 
freedom of the press (and free expression to the extent that is related to press freedom) 
is sufficient to guarantee that the press serves its distinctive role in contributing to 
the public interest. On the one hand this is problematic because press freedom is only 
a necessary condition for the press to make its distinctive contribution to the public 
interest. Treating it as a sufficient condition is making the press insensitive to all the 
other factors that are critical to this – accuracy and rigour, avoidance of partiality, 
bias,  conflict  of  interest,  and  the  other  factors  mentioned  above.  All  these  must 
receive appropriate attention. But this is also problematic because assuming that a 
process (a free press) will achieve a beneficial goal allows journalists and editors to 
fail to address carefully the question of what exactly that distinctive purpose is, or 
how it relates to other parts of the public interest.” 29

Chapter 4 | The Responsibilities of the Press B“While  it  is  important  to  protect  genuine  investigative  journalism  into  matters  of 
public interest … it is also important to distinguish the genuine article from purported 
investigative journalism that ignores or flouts the relevant disciplines of truth seeking, 
or is not directed at any matters of public interest. Pseudo public interest journalism 
discredits the genuine article, is not assessable by its audiences and damages the 
reputation of the media.” 30
“The  moral  justification  for  a  media  organisation’s  rights  of  expression  and 
communication … turns on the role of media organisations’ rights in constituting a 
public sphere that gives appropriate status and respect to individual people, and on 
the  related  instrumental  grounds  [of  constraining  power  and  enabling  democratic 
deliberation and decision-making].” 31
“The public interest is not just in a free but a diverse press, and also – given the press’s 
power and its central role within the public sphere of democratic policy-making – an 
accountable press too.” 32
“The fact that the press has certain investigative powers doesn’t mean automatically 
that it has carte blanche to do whatever it wishes to find things out.” 33
“Freedom and responsibility are not incompatible notions. … Principally behind the 
notion of freedom in my account is freedom from censorship, from authorities coming 
in and telling the press what they may or may not say with respect to output, but they 
may nonetheless have a number of responsibilities they need to respect in producing 
those outputs. I think that’s very important. No, I don’t see them as inconsistent.” 34

4.5 

The point was also made more narrowly, to underline that the freedom of the press, and the 
value inherent in its freedom to publish, is the beginning and not the end of the questions 
about the public interest:

“The fact that freedom of expression is in the public interest – and it clearly is – it 
doesn’t follow that every instance of expression is in the public interest.” 35
“I think a kind of slippage can happen in which this freedom of expression is seen to 
be the primary public interest the public has in the press, and then that can then seem 
as liable to trump many of the other side constraints. … So, and if one’s a journalist 
and one values being allowed to write what one thinks is important, … there’s a kind 
of, as I say, a natural slippage in which this freedom of expression can be seen to be 
the dominating aspect of one’s code.” 36

4.6 

I set these thoughts out to underline, and indeed to risk labouring, the point that ethical 
standards are not inconsistent with a free press but necessary for it fully to realise the value 
of its freedom. Ethical standards and behaviour are about valuing the freedom of the press 
for what it is, and seeking to promote all that is good about that freedom, and not just about

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestBavoiding the shoddy and the disreputable (far less just the unlawful). A free press certainly 
has choices which it can exercise in ways which undermine the premises of its freedom and 
work contrary to the public interest. An ethical press will not choose to exercise its freedoms 
in that way.

4.7  With freedom, rights and privilege therefore come choices, and with choices, responsibilities 
as to how they are exercised and with what consequences. With choices which affect the 
public sphere, come also public accountabilities.

4.8 

4.9 

The private interests of the press industry, or of organisations within it, can be expected to 
be strongly aligned with the public interest for just this reason: it is what the free press in a 
democracy is all about. But there will also be powerful motivations of a contrary nature to be 
overcome by an ethical press. An ethical approach requires a culture of care and awareness, 
but deadlines are short and time is money. A diverse and plural press will also be a highly 
competitive one, contesting among its titles for readership and reputation. And the pressures 
of public demand, real or perceived, are by no means a reliable guide to the public interest.

This latter point is a well-worn one: the fundamental difference between the public interest 
and what interests the public. It is nevertheless a point which it is important to stress once 
again, if only because of the seeming indefatigability of the argument in some quarters that 
whatever sells newspapers must ipso facto be a good thing, since newspapers are a good 
thing in themselves. The argument is sometimes put more subtly: that newspapers should 
simply meet the demands and expectations they perceive their readers to have or be capable 
of having in a non-judgmental way, and that the flourishing of newspapers by such means 
directly supports their ability to fulfil the higher purposes and freedoms of the press. But 
this is simply a further restatement of the error that because it is good for the press both 
to flourish and to be free to make choices, its exercise of those choices in its own perceived 
interests will itself necessarily be good. The fallacy of this line of reasoning was emphasised 
to the Inquiry in a number of ways:

“The key point here is that the fact that people have a (vicious) curiosity clearly does 
not entail a right to know those things, nor does it automatically excuse those who 
breach other norms in the service of that curiosity.” 37
“There is no ethical duty at all to provide audiences with whatever they want, even if 
there are good economic reasons for doing so.” 38
“The ‘we are only providing people with what they want’ may appear to have a whiff 
of nobility about it, but where people’s wants are vicious, it is little more than an 
admission of lack of moral sensitivity.” 39
“[The idea of the public’s ‘right to know’] is puzzling and problematic for many reasons. 
First, it is not clear what the scope of the right is (right to know what?). Second, the 
very idea of a right to know is problematic. If it is a negative claim right (no one is 
permitted to stop me from knowing) then this does not entail any correlative right 
of  publication  or  communication.  But  a  positive  right  to  know  (others  are  obliged 
to ensure that I know) is not feasible: I might not believe them, even if they tell me 
the truth. Worst still, it doesn’t tell us anything at all about whom the obligation to 
inform might fall upon.” 40

Chapter 4 | The Responsibilities of the Press B4.10  The  commercial  interests  of  the  press  in  supplying  or  stimulating  demands  for  particular 
kinds of content are not therefore either identical to, or even necessarily aligned with, the 
public interest in a free press. More than that, in an industry with people as its stock in trade, 
and assuming an evident and growing public appetite for information about other people 
which is contrary to the public interest because of the way in which it affects the personal 
autonomy or individual rights of those people, the commercial interests of the press have a 
clear potential to act contrary to the public interest.

4.11  There are other respects in which the commercial interests of the press have a clear potential 
to tend contrary to the public interest. They include the instances discussed above in which 
the  private  interests  of  individual  journalists,  editors  or  proprietors  may  be  engaged  in 
editorial content in ways which may not be apparent to their readership.41 They also include 
incentives to anti-competitive business practices and cartel behaviour, that is to say practices 
which may benefit one organisation at the expense of the diversity of the sector as a whole, 
or which may seek to unite the industry against healthy competitive disciplines and external 
scrutiny capable of benefiting readers and the public as a whole.

4.12  There was some emphasis throughout the Inquiry on the place of ethical codes in supporting 
an ethical press. I put the matter that way with care. No code of ethics can make an unethical 
organisation or sector an ethical one. An unethical organisation will simply find ways round 
or  disregard  any  code  it  purports  to  apply  to  itself  when  motivated  to  do  so.  An  ethical 
organisation, on the other hand, will be helped and guided by a code of ethics, but that will 
be on the basis that the code is simply a clear encapsulation of the values and practices of 
the organisation in any event.

4.13  This is a very fundamental issue about culture, practices and ethics, and the way they relate 
to  each  other.  Professor  Christopher  Megone,  who  has  worked  extensively  with  industry 
bodies (mainly in finance and engineering) on issues of workplace ethics, put the matter this 
way to the Inquiry:

“Of course an ethical media organisation needs to have an ethical code, one which 
reflects the distinctive mission of the organisation as part of the press (and thus is 
aware of the key role of the press regarding the public interest), and one which is 
sensitive to the particular ethical challenges that may arise for editors, journalists, 
etc in pursuit of their mission.
“However,  even  more  critical  to  the  existence  of  an  ethical  media  organisation  is 
culture. … If there is an unhealthy culture then an organisation can have an ethical 
code but it will have little influence. Members of the organisation can undergo ‘ethics 
training’ but it will have little effect. As soon as they return from the training to their 
desk or office, the pervasive culture will dominate their decision-making. The culture 
brings  to  bear  all  sorts  of  ‘accepted  norms’  which  an  afternoon’s  training  will  be 
relatively powerless to affect. (I do not, of course, think that good ‘ethics training’ 
is pointless, but simply that its effectiveness depends on whether, or to what extent, 
other factors are in place in the organisation.) …
“… there are a number of critical factors that could be expected to bear on ethical 
culture  in  a  media  organisation.  First,  tone  from  the  top  –  leadership  –  is  of 
tremendous importance. The role of owners and editors here will be crucial. Certainly 
the  organisation  needs  to  have  its  ethical  code,  but  that  code  needs  to  be  fully 
understood and endorsed by its owners and editors, and these people need to live

86

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestBout that code day in and day out. This is a decisive factor in that code having meaning 
for all who work in the organisation. But their living it out means thinking about how 
they can convey the code through their practice right across the organisation, how 
they interact with employees right across the organisation in a way that makes it 
resonant for them. …
“Secondly, an ethical organisation needs to have an open and honest culture in which 
it is possible for members of the organisation to raise their concerns about practices 
and to discuss them with colleagues and senior staff. … [S]taff need to feel confident 
that if they perceive unsatisfactory practices to be developing, or face a challenging 
situation, they can raise the matter with colleagues or senior staff. And they need 
to be confident that they can do so, and have a proper discussion, without fear of 
mockery or retribution. ‘Accepted norms’ need to be open to challenge. …
“Amongst  other  things,  developing  an  open  culture  in  a  press/media  organisation 
will require sensitivity to the particular kinds of pressure that journalists and other 
employees are bound to be under.”

4.14  Against  this  background,  an  operative  code  of  ethics  therefore  would  have  a  number  of 

potential functions.

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

It would serve as a reminder of the special importance and roles, the freedoms and 
privileges, the power and responsibilities of the press. It would, in other words, provide 
a full context for the choices which fall to be made in practice so that they can be made 
in accordance with the principles to be derived from this context. It would, in short, 
explain what ethical (or, as it is sometimes described, ‘public interest’) journalism is.
It would help journalists to understand the circumstances in which they are called upon 
to make ethical decisions. It would help them to make the right choices in practice. It 
would do this not as a matter of rigid and disconnected prescriptions and prohibitions, 
but by promoting “a stable disposition to act in certain ways for the right reasons”.42
It  would  recognise  and  explain  the  circumstances  in  which  the  temptations  and 
motivations  to  act  unethically  (including  commercial  motivations)  may  be  especially 
strong, and why they need to be resisted, in order to change the incentive structure in 
such cases.43
It would seek to provide clarity, and would focus on practical applicability to everyday 
decision-making.
It would not expect to stand alone. It would take its place in a context of ethical culture, 
sources of advice and guidance both generally and at the particular levels of training, 
reinforcement, management and feedback.
It would be authoritative and respected. It would have consequences in terms of how 
individuals and organisations are perceived, in terms of rewards and sanctions.

4.15  The Inquiry asked a number of its witnesses specifically, and through its website the public 
more generally, what would be the distinguishing features of the culture and practices of a 
media industry, or any organisation which was a part of that industry, which would make it a 
recognisably ‘ethical’ one. I was particularly interested to hear in response about Professor

Chapter 4 | The Responsibilities of the Press BBaroness O’Neill’s suggested ‘six principles of openness’44 for identifying ethical journalism 
which seem to me to have much to recommend them:45

(a)  openness about payments from others
(b)  openness about payments to others
(c) 

openness about the interests (financial or otherwise) of owners, editors, programme-
makers and journalists
(d)  openness about errors
(e)  openness about (most) sources, with an adequately drawn test of the public interest to 

allow sources to be kept secret, for specific reasons and in particular situations
openness about comments from members of the public.

(f) 

4.16 

It is also worth setting out extracts from some of the answers to this question which appear 
to me to be particularly illuminative.

“I do not mean a media industry driven by ethical goals in the way that a charity like 
Oxfam is. I mean, rather, a media industry whose members and whose regulatory 
framework, while driven by a range of diverse goals that are not necessarily ‘ethical’ 
in a narrow sense, are nonetheless deeply sensitive to the industry’s pivotal role in 
the liberal public sphere … A free press within an ethical media industry in this sense 
would have the following features, among others:

–  a sense of journalism as a profession with its own aims and values, including 
respect for the truth, respect for those about whom the press writes, respect 
for readers;

– 

–  poor practices (unethical, illegal, or contrary to the reasons supporting press 
freedom) are regarded as shameful and their practitioners are ashamed of 
them;- whistle-blowers are supported;
journalists, editors and proprietors grasp the complexity of the moral role of 
the press (as, perhaps, politicians since the expenses scandal grasp the moral 
complexity of their own role);
the wider public is willing to pay the comparatively high costs (e.g. of ethical 
investigative  methods)  to  support  a  press  that  upholds  a  liberal  public 
sphere.46” In my view media organisations are ethical if they genuinely try to 
communicate in ways that enable intended audiences to understand and to 
assess what they publish, while respecting the legitimate claims of those on 
whom they comment and of those affected by their reporting.

– 

These are demanding aims. To meet them the media need not only to refrain from 
unlawful speech acts (threatening, bribing, defaming, breaches of data protection, 
breaches  of  confidentiality  –  and  many  others)  but  to  meet  adequate  ethical  and 
epistemic standards in journalistic, editorial and business practice.” 47

PART B | The Press and the Public InterestB“1. There is a need for an aspirational code, not simply a list of prohibitions against 

failings which those in the media fall into.

2.  Such  a  code  needs  to  be  presented  in  the  context  of  the  specific  critical 

contribution that a free press can make to the public interest...

3.  The code could then be developed in terms of the duties to the key parties with 

whom the press/media interact in ethically relevant ways.

4.  A code by itself is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is a lived code. 
To make a code a lived code, media organisations need to attend to the critical 
factors that can bring about an ethical organisation, or promote integrity in 
an organisation. These factors include tone from the top (or leadership), an 
open and honest culture, and so on. …

5.  Part  of  developing  such  an  ethically  reflective  organisation  might  be  to 
introduce  governance  reports  which  press/media  would  produce  annually, 
writing such reports in light of the requirements of the code. The reports might 
reflect both on the ethical culture of the organisation and on the organisation’s 
contribution to the public interest. Any such governance reporting would need 
to avoid either being overburdensome or being a mere ritual in order to be 
both effective and meaningful…” 48

“In order for a code of conduct to be properly effective it has to be, not only coherent 
and  justified  in  terms  of  its  normative  content,  but  such  that  there  is  something 
about the social, institutional, legal or practical context that motivates and secures 
compliance.” 49

4.17 

I conclude this analysis by recognising the risks that this Inquiry must confront. The Editor-
in-Chief of the Mail titles, Paul Dacre, identified these risks, and the challenges the Inquiry 
faces, in this way:50

“...I would argue that Britain’s commercially viable free press, because it’s in hock to 
nobody, is the only real free media in this country. Over-regulate that press, and you 
put democracy itself in peril.”

I have always been keenly aware of the dangers of going too far; and I have been continually 
reminded as the Inquiry has progressed. In short, it has not been difficult for me to remain 
alive to this critical risk. I go further. The public interest in a press which is free, which is 
viable, and which is diverse cannot be too highly valued. Without investigative journalism, 
and the ability of the press to scour hidden places, the domain of the powerful, for potential 
wrongdoing, our democracy would be severely impoverished. Nothing I shall recommend will 
fail to hold to these principles.

Introduction
The Inquiry is required to examine the culture, practices and ethics of the press but, in order 
to do that, it is helpful to set out the commercial context within which the press operates. 
This Part of the Report looks at the market for news provision and some of the ways in which 
it is changing as well as the newspaper market more generally. This Chapter looks briefly at 
the economics of the newspaper market and where the challenges are coming from. 

C

Chapter 2 looks at the main players in the newspaper industry, including a brief review of the 
history of each where relevant, the financial and commercial performance of each and the 
governance and compliance processes in place at each title. This is all important background 
in order to understand the differences, if any, between the cultures and practices of individual 
titles and publishers. The focus of Chapter 2 is on the national press, and within that on those 
with the largest circulation and market share. The Chapter also looks briefly at the markets 
for regional and local newspapers and for magazines, drawing, in particular, on evidence that 
the Inquiry has heard from specific titles. There is no attempt at a detailed analysis of these 
markets; this is not needed for the subsequent consideration of the issues at the heart of this 
inquiry.

Chapter 3 looks at other, non-print, news providers. This includes both the economic models 
and market pressures, but also the regulatory environment within which they operate. Again, 
this is important context for subsequent analysis.

Finally, Chapter 4 looks at the way in which competition law specifically applies to the press 
and the media, providing a brief history of media ownership and plurality provisions and how 
they currently apply. 

2.  Commercial pressures on the press
2.1 

It  is  undeniable  that  the  market  in  which  newspapers  compete  has  changed  substantially 
over recent decades and continues to change rapidly. The rise of digital broadcasting and the 
internet mean that UK citizens now have a much broader range of news and media providers 
offering news coverage, current affairs and entertainment than ever before; and newspapers 
have to compete in this market both for advertising revenue and for readership. 

2.2 

The result is that newspapers have a significantly smaller reach than they did 20 years ago, to 
say nothing of 50 years ago, and are operating in a media environment in which consumers and 
citizens have very different expectations of standards from different types of media. Whilst 
newspapers are losing their share of the market, the costs of producing the news are not 
reducing significantly and much of the competition on the internet comes from organisations 
which are not, themselves, the originators of news content. 

2.3 

These  changes  mean  that  the  commercial  environment  in  which  the  press  is  operating  is 
quite different to that in which the current self-regulatory regime was first established.

Newspaper economics
The media landscape in 2012 is very different from that which Sir David Calcutt QC looked 
at when he made his recommendations that led to the establishment of the PCC in 1990. 
Then, the internet did not exist as a consumer medium, UK citizens had access to only four 
terrestrial TV channels, BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4, and satellite broadcasting had only 
just begun and was accessed by only a tiny minority of families. On the radio, citizens could 
listen to the (then) four BBC national radio stations (only joined midway through 1990 by 
Radio 5), local BBC radio and 69 commercial local radio stations. This meant that, in reality, 
most people had a choice of only two different radio providers.

National  newspaper  circulation  stood  at  over  15  million  for  the  national  daily  newspapers 
and nearly 18 million for the Sunday papers.1 Regional and local press circulation (for paid-for 
papers) was nearly 17 million in total. The UK citizen therefore had limited sources of news and 
was heavily dependent on newspapers; broadcast media was limited to a very narrow range of 
broadcasters, with TV broadcasters, at least, having a public service remit in respect of news. 

The picture now is very different. The citizen today has a very wide range of sources of national, 
international and local news and comment, in a world of ever growing media complexity. 
Virtually every UK household has digital TV, providing a profusion of channels, including four 
free-to-view 24 hour news channels and others available with subscription. There are now 
21 national radio channels, and 344 local radio stations,2 all of which will carry some form 
of news. 

Over 70% of adults in the UK have access to broadband.3 All media organisations, whether 
newspapers, broadcasters, or others now have some form of established internet presence, 
and the internet has opened up access to UK citizens to news coverage from across the world; 
some of this is from professional media organisations, but it also includes ‘citizen journalism’ 
from individuals sharing their experience of, and views on, events that occur. Nearly a quarter 
of all the time that adults spend engaging with media is spent on the internet.4 

Against this growing digital activity, newspaper circulation has fallen significantly, as shown by 
the table below. The national daily newspaper circulation stood at 9.45 million in September 
2011.5  As  Claire  Enders  explained  at  one  of  the  Inquiry  seminars  in  October  2011,  the 
declines since 1990 and the Calcutt report have been biggest in the popular national press 
and the regional press, both falling by over 40%6 while the quality national press have seen 
falls of only 25% over that timescale. However, the decline has accelerated since 2005;7 that 
period has seen the whole of the 25% post-Calcutt fall in circulation of the quality nationals, 
while the popular nationals have fallen only by 14% in that time scale. Whilst other media 
sectors are now showing recovery from the recession, that is not the case with newspapers 
and magazines.8

2.10  Newspaper and magazine revenues come from three sources: copy sales revenue, display 
advertising  and  classified  advertising.  In  the  national  press the  main  revenue  streams are 
overwhelmingly sales revenue and display advertising: 52.6% from copy sales in quality press, 
58.2% in popular press and only 27% in the regional press, where classified advertising makes

Chapter 1 | ContextCup  41.4%  of  revenue.  Both  copy  sales  and  display  advertising  revenue  streams  are  under 
pressure. 

2.11  Competition for display advertising spend is marked, with much advertising moving online. 
The Online Advertising Bureau stated that UK digital advertising expenditure grew 2.6% to 
£2.59 billion in the first half of 2012.10 In addition, advertising spend has historically declined 
when growth in the economy is slow, adding further pressures on newspaper revenues. More 
dramatically, print classified advertising has been particularly hard hit by the move to online. 
Online models have proved highly successful with buyers and sellers. 

2.12  Thus, revenues accrued through recruitment advertising have reduced from £150 million per 
year to £20 million per year, and there has been a similar decline in property advertising.11 
Recruiters simply do not need to place print advertisements any more. Further, public sector 
advertising,  once  a  source  of  considerable  revenue  for  both  regional  and  national  press, 
has also largely moved online with significant implications for the revenues of newspaper 
businesses.12 The editors of Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish newspapers who have given 
evidence said that advertising revenues were particularly important for the smaller circulation 
papers, and emphasised the impact of the loss of advertising from the public sector for those 
smaller papers.13 

2.13  All  of  this  means  that  newspapers  face  significant  economic  pressures.  However,  whilst 
newspapers  revenues  have  fallen  for  most  publishing  groups  in  the  last  five  years,  the 
different ownership and operation structures within the industry mean that the impact of 
these pressures is different. 

2.14  Table C1.2 below shows the revenues of major newspaper groups in 2012 and the change 

from 2005 to 2012.

2.15  Certainly there has been no structural like-for-like shift in advertising revenues for newspapers 
from print to online editions. Although the proportion of advertising online spend has grown 
at  a  considerable  rate,  those  revenues  are  shared  by  a  far  greater  number  of  businesses 
including micro bloggers and other online businesses. Although the internet enables highly 
personalised targeted advertising, for which advertisers will pay a premium, such revenues 
derived from advertising directed at specific types of user, so-called targeted or behavioural 
advertising, have not in any way matched the decline in revenue from traditional sources. It 
is certainly telling and illustrative of the challenges faced by newspapers that the UK’s most 
successful online newspapers, the MailOnline and the Guardian, have yet to find a way of 
converting this into substantial or comparable profit.

2.16  This  advertising  is  driven  by  the  availability  of  vast  quantities  of  data,  both  personal  and 
more general, that users upload when they make online purchases, or through anonymised 
tracking of individuals ISPs and other providers when users browse the internet. This model 
has served the internet industry and users well to a point. However, recent changes to the law 
restricting the use of cookies and other tracking technologies without the informed consent 
of the user may further dilute the potential revenues that a newspaper or other business may 
derive from this source.

2.17  The Inquiry has been told that circulation may be boosted temporarily, through price cutting 
or promotional campaigns, but these do not generally have a long term impact and circulation 
levels tend to fall back once the promotional activity is discontinued.14

Chapter 1 | ContextCImpact of pressures on business models

2.18  The Inquiry has heard different interpretations of the impact of these economic pressures 
on newspaper business models. It is common ground that falling revenues and the increased 
need to produce copy 24 hours a day has resulted in fewer journalists having to do more 
work. 

2.19  Editors have argued that the financial levels affect staffing levels but that this simply means 
that journalists work harder15 and that there is no reduction in the quality of journalism. The 
Inquiry has been told that the economic difficulties have not affected training of journalists.16

2.20  Others17 have suggested that the effect of journalists having to produce more stories in less 
time and with less resource is that material is not as thoroughly checked as it once was, press 
releases  are  reproduced  uncritically  and  stories  are  recycled  around  the  media  with  little 
development or additional checking. 

2.21  The impact on regional newspapers has been more severe, with a number of titles merging 
or closing. For example, the Trinity Mirror portfolio of regional newspapers has fallen from 
160 titles to 140.18 

2.22  Across the press the same challenge faces all titles in respect of how to make money from 
content online in a world where advertising revenues and revenues from physical circulation 
continue to decline,19 whilst readership online is growing. Two UK daily titles (the Financial 
Times and the Times) operate behind paywalls but this is not necessarily seen as a solution 
that can work across the industry.

2.23  That is not to say that, as is clear from Chapter 2 in this Part, there are not parts of the UK 

press that are profitable and, in some cases, highly profitable.

Introduction
In  this  Chapter  I  examine  the  history,  governance  structures  and  finances  of  the  major 
British newspapers. I will look first and in some detail at those newspapers owned by News 
International (NI), and ultimately by the parent company in the US, News Corporation.1 This 
is fitting given the central role of the News of the World (NoTW) in the events that led to 
establishment of this Inquiry, as well as the extraordinary influence that Rupert Murdoch has 
exercised over the development of the press in Britain, since he purchased NoTW newspaper 
in 1969. I will then look at the history, governance structures and finances of the other major 
British newspaper publishing houses, before turning albeit briefly to the regional press and 
the magazine industry.

2.3 

Group history and context
News Corporation (News Corp) was founded in 1979 as a holding company for Mr Murdoch’s 
Australian  newspaper  business,  News  Ltd,  to  manage  News  Ltd’s  growing  portfolio  of 
international assets particularly in the United Kingdom and the US.2 Mr Murdoch is both the 
Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corp3 which, as of 2009, is the world’s second largest 
media conglomerate in terms of revenue, and the third largest in terms of entertainment. 
Although News Corp was initially incorporated in South Australia, reflecting the Australian 
origins of the business, in November 2004 the company was re-incorporated under Delaware 
Corporation Law. News Corp is now listed on the NASDAQ and has secondary listings on the 
Australian Securities Exchange.

News  Corp  now  has  global  reach,  and  in  addition  to  its  holdings  in  its  traditional  British, 
American  and  Australian  newspaper  markets,  it  has  substantial  operations  in  India,  Italy, 
Germany,  Brazil  and  Hong  Kong  that  span  both  traditional  media  as  well  as  new  media, 
telecommunications and the internet.4

Group governance
News Corp is headquartered in New York. The News Corp Board of Directors is made up 17 
directors and includes those in executive and non-executive capacities.5 The Board sets the 
strategic direction for News Corp and its subsidiaries and is responsible for the corporate 
governance of the company. These processes are published on the News Corp website.6 In 

1 The Times is published by Times Newspapers Ltd and the other titles by News Group Newspapers Ltd. The corporate 
structures are examined below.

June 2012 News Corp announced that it intends to pursue the separation of its publishing 
and media and entertainment businesses into two distinct publicly traded companies. Rupert 
Murdoch would remain Chairman of both companies.7

The Murdoch family owns a 29% stake in the company. As these shares are voting shares, 
Mr Murdoch exercises effective control of the company. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud of 
Saudi Arabia owns 7% of News Corp’s shares through his Kingdom Holding Company, making 
him the second largest shareholder in News Corp.

The Management and Standards Committee
News Corp established the Management and Standards Committee (MSC) to take responsibility 
for all matters in relation to phone hacking at NoTW, payments to the police and all other 
related issues at NI.8

The MSC is autonomous from News Corp and NI.9 It works to ensure full co-operation with all 
investigations into these issues, including this Inquiry, the police inquiries, civil proceedings 
and Parliamentary hearings.

The MSC is authorised to conduct internal investigations to fulfil its responsibilities in relation 
to NI’s papers: The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times. It has power to direct NI staff to co-
operate fully with all external and internal investigations, and to preserve, obtain and disclose 
appropriate documents.

An  important  part  of  the  MSC  role  is  to  recommend  and  oversee  the  implementation  of 
new policies  and  systems to ensure that editorial  practices at NI’s titles meet the highest 
standards.10 The MSC’s role is to ensure that NI’s titles are underpinned by a robust governance, 
compliance and legal structure.11

The MSC originally reported to Joel Klein, Executive Vice-President and a director of News 
Corp,12 but at the time of writing, reports to Gerson Zweifach, Senior Executive Vice-President 
and Group General Counsel of News Corp, who in turn report to the independent directors 
on the News Corp Board through Professor Viet Dinh, an independent Director on the News 
Corp Board of Directors.13 The role of the MSC is addressed in more detail later in the report.14

Financial results

2.10  News Corp estimates its global assets to be worth some $61.98bn.15 Its financial results reflect 
the global scale of the organisation. In 2010, it reported a turnover $32.78bn, an 8% increase 
on its turnover for 2009.16 In 2011, this had risen further to £33.41bn. News Corp posted 
profits of $2.54bn in 2010 and $2.99bn in 2011.17

PART C | The PressC2.11  Although newspapers were once central to the News Corp business model this is no longer 
the case. In the 2009/2010 financial year, newspapers accounted for just 13% of News Corp’s 
overall  profit.18  By  contrast,  in  2001,  newspapers  had  contributed  to  30%  of  News  Corp’s 
total profits.19 In 2010 New Corp’s television businesses provided around 56% percent of the 
company’s total profit.

2.12  The closure of NoTW in July 2011 affected the profitability of the company’s newspaper and 
publishing businesses. Profit fell 38%, to $110 million. The company reported a $91 million 
pre-tax charge related to its British newspaper business.

2.13 

Annual conference
In  addition  to  its  media  interests,  News  Corp  also  plays  a  role  in  public  policy  discussion, 
organising and hosting an annual Management Conference, the aim of which is to provide a 
forum for the discussion of media issues and policy in relation to world events. The conference 
is not only for News Corp’s senior executives and journalists but also for policy makers and 
other  interested  parties.  The  conference  has  been  held  in  Cancun,  Mexico,  and  Hayman 
Island, Australia, as well as Pebble Beach, California.

2.14  The News Corp Management Conference is a private event, and in so far as can be established, 
no records of the meetings are made available. However, details of the 2006 event in Pebble 
Beach were leaked together with an agenda to the Los Angeles Times.20 According to that 
newspaper, agenda items ranged from discussions on Europe, to broadcasting and new media 
and terrorism. Speakers have included Rupert Murdoch, the Governor of California, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Tony Blair, ex-President Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Senator John McCain and the 
Israeli President, Shimon Peres.21

2.15  News Corporation’s UK newspaper interests are held by its wholly-owned subsidiary, NI,22 
which is the parent company both of Times Newspapers Holdings Ltd (TNHL) and of News 
Group Newspapers Limited (NGN). Times Newspapers Limited (TNL), the publisher of The 
Times and The Sunday Times, is a subsidiary of TNHL. NGN is the publisher of The Sun and 
The Sun on Sunday, and formerly published NoTW.23

2.17 

In 1987, NI bought the Today newspaper, a mid-market tabloid that had launched in 1986 and 
pioneered the use of colour printing and computerised editing. However, the title struggled 
financially and did not make a profit. It was closed on 17 November 1995.

In  September  2006,  NI  launched  The  London  Paper.  This  was  the  first  title  to  have  been 
launched rather than bought by the UK subsidiary. The London Paper, an evening freesheet 
published fives times each week, was distributed at bus and railway stations across London. 
In September 2009 the paper closed in the face of intense competition from the other free 
titles distributed in London, including the Metro, the London Lite and the Evening Standard.

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C2.18  The Sun considers itself a family newspaper. Mr Murdoch made clear his view in an interview 
with the title ahead of the launch of The Sun on Sunday that the new Sunday edition of the 
paper would be “family orientated” and “ethical”.24 Indeed, in his evidence to the Inquiry, the 
current editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, expressed his firmly held belief that The Sun is a 
powerful “force for good,”25 and cited the work undertaken by the paper to enable its poorest 
readers to afford holidays as well as its recent work in schools promoting science learning. The 
Sun also sees itself as a campaigning newspaper, championing causes it considers important 
to its readers26 such as the Help for Heroes campaign.27

2.19  Mr Murdoch described NoTW as:28

“a  campaigning  newspaper….  certainly  it  was  interested  in  celebrities,  just  as  the 
public is, and a much greater investment went into covering the weekend soccer….. 
Coverage of celebrities, yes. Salacious gossip? Meaning – I take gossip as meaning 
unfounded stories about celebrities: no. I certainly hope not.”

James Murdoch described the brand of NoTW as:29

“an investigative newspaper with exposes and the like, wasn’t only concerned with 
celebrities  and  salacious  gossip,  but  also  uncovering  real  wrongdoing,  scandals, 
campaigning and so on and so forth.”

2.20  NI has described The Times as “renowned for its ability to deliver accurate, intelligent and 
engaging information”.30 Both The Times and The Sunday Times have a long and established 
a reputation for quality investigative journalism, particularly The Sunday Times’ Insight Team, 
which has been responsible for stories such as the exposure of the spy scandal relating to the 
MI6 agent Kim Philby, the scandal of Thalidomide, as well as more recent allegations of vote 
rigging at FIFA.

News International history: News Group

2.21  NoTW was purchased by Rupert Murdoch in January 1969. The Sun, which had been launched 
by the International Publishing Corporation (IPC) in 1964, was acquired by Mr Murdoch in 
October 1969. The two newspapers were published as sister titles from that date until the 
closure of NoTW on 10 July 2011. At the time of its acquisition The Sun was almost bankrupt. 
Changes to content, and in particular the introduction of a far more irreverent and informal 
style,  as  well  as  changes  to  editorial  policy  and  production  methods,  led  to  a  dramatic 
turnaround in the newspaper’s fortunes.31 Within three years, The Sun newspaper was not only 
highly profitable, providing much of the necessary finance for further acquisitions elsewhere, 
but was successfully challenging the Daily Mirror as the UK’s best selling newspaper.

PART C | The PressC2.22  Mr Murdoch introduced a style and understanding of journalism that he had developed at 
the Adelaide News. In an otherwise staid newspaper market, the re-launched The Sun and 
NoTW were irreverent and anti-establishment. This new approach to tabloid journalism was 
well illustrated in the publication in NoTW of Christine Keeler’s memoir of the 1963 Profumo 
affair. Indeed, some commentators have suggested this was a, if not the, defining moment 
in the development of a journalistic ethos at what was to become NI.32 The Keeler article 
certainly boosted sales, although Mr Murdoch received much criticism from his competitors 
of reporting ‘old’ news, especially of such a nature.33

2.23  The Sun under Mr Murdoch set out to appeal to a broader cross-section of society. Innovations 
in  content  intended  to  appeal  to  a  mass  market  included  the  introduction  of  television 
coverage, and the advent of the first Page 3 girl in 1970. This marked the first anniversary of 
the re-launched tabloid and quickly became a controversial trademark of the paper, albeit 
copied by its competitors. During this period, the circulation of The Sun increased from 1 
million in 1969 to over 3.8 million in 1980, peaking at 4 million in 1978 under Sir Larry Lamb’s 
editorship.34

2.24  Mr  Murdoch  was  not  only  responsible  for  the  introduction  of  a  new  approach  to  tabloid 
journalism at both The Sun and NoTW, he also introduced important changes to methods 
of  production  to  all  his  titles.  Although  these  changes  were  criticised  by  some  within  the 
industry at the time and, indeed, led to a bitter and protracted dispute with both the print 
unions  and  the  National  Union  of  Journalists  (NUJ),  commentators  have  credited  these 
changes,  which  have  since  been  adopted  by  all  newspapers,  with  ensuring  the  economic 
viability of the British newspaper industry.

2.25  NI’s move to Wapping  and  decision  to face down the print unions,  had  strong support  in 
Government. Indeed, throughout the strike in the mid-1980s, NI was able to maintain almost 
full production and distribution capabilities as well as a complement of leading journalists. 
The  company  was  therefore  content  to  allow  the  dispute  to  run  its  course.  With  many 
thousands of workers having gone without pay for over a year, the strike eventually collapsed 
on 5 February 1987.

2.26 

It has been suggested that the defeat of the unions would not have been possible without 
the  support  of  the  Conservative  Government  of  the  time.35  Irrespective  of  any  political 
support, the changes implemented by Mr Murdoch set a precedent: within two years of the 
conclusion of the strike, most of the national papers had followed NI’s lead, left Fleet Street, 
and changed their printing practices.

2.27  Although both The Sun and NI are conservative in outlook, the political loyalties of neither 
paper have been set in stone. Some commentators have argued that so influential has the 
tabloid become that it is able to decide the outcome of elections.36 Certainly, that was the 
clear inference of The Sun’s front page headline following the Conservative election victory in 
April 1992, “It was The Sun wot won it”.37

2.28  Although The Sun and NoTW backed the Labour Party in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general 
elections, the relationship between the New Labour Government and the NI titles had grown

that Tony Blair “deserved one last chance”.38 In late September 2009, on the day of Gordon 
Brown’s keynote speech to the Labour Party Conference, The Sun announced that it would 
support the Conservative Party in the 2010 election. The detail of the relationship between 
Mr  Murdoch  and  politicians,  including  how  that  influenced  the  editorial  stance  of  his 
newspapers, is considered in detail in Part I

2.29  The Sun now has the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in the UK, selling approximately 
2.7 million copies each day. The paper claims a readership of almost 9 million.39 NoTW, at its 
time of closure in July 2011 had a circulation of just under 2.7 million and represented 28% 
of the Sunday tabloid market.40

2.30  The first edition of The Sun on Sunday achieved sales of 3.2 million but since has dropped to 

a level of sales similar to that of NoTW before its closure, at 2.6 million.41

News International history: Times Newspapers Holdings Limited

2.31  TNHL was established in 1967 when the Thomson Corporation purchased The Times from the 
Astor family and merged it with The Sunday Times. The Times is the oldest of the major UK 
national newspapers and was first published in 1785. It has been published continuously ever 
since, save for a ten month period in the late 1970s.

2.32  Faced with escalating productions costs and a commercial model that was under increasing 
threat, the Thomson Organisation decided to put both titles up for sale at the end of 1980. NI 
reached an agreement with Thomson to acquire those papers. Under Section 58 of the Fair 
Trading Act 1973 any newspaper merger at the time required the consent of the Secretary of 
State for Trade. Further, and subject to two exceptions, the Secretary of State was prohibited 
from  giving  his  consent  to  such  a  merger  unless  he  had  first  received  a  report  from  the 
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).

2.33  The Thomson Organisation imposed deadlines beyond which they said they would no longer 
support The Times (14 March 1981) or The Sunday Times (8 March 1981). The then Secretary 
of State, John Biffen, told Parliament that this factor, taken together with the financial figures 
for the two newspapers, convinced him that neither title was economic as a going concern 
and that to require an MMC reference would risk the closure of both titles, the loss of 4,000 
jobs  and  the  possibility  of  the  permanent  closure  of  The  Times.42  He  therefore  gave  his 
consent for the merger to go ahead, but he also imposed eight conditions:43

“First, the newspapers are to be published as separate newspapers.
Second,  future  disposals  are  to  be  subject  to  the  consent  of  a  majority  of  the 
independent national directors of Times Newspapers Holdings Ltd.

PART C | The PressCThird, the number of these independent directors is to be increased from four to six 
and the appointment of any independent national directors in the future is not to be 
made without the approval of the existing independent national directors.
Fourth, on editorial independence, the editors shall not be appointed or dismissed 
without the approval of the majority of the independent national directors.
Fifth, the editor of each newspaper shall retain control over any political comment 
published in his newspaper and, in particular, shall not be subject to any restraint or 
inhibition in expressing opinion or in reporting news that might directly or indirectly 
conflict with the opinions or interests of any of the newspaper proprietors.
Sixth, instructions to journalists shall be given only by the editor or those to whom he 
has delegated authority.
Seventh,  subject  only  to  any  annual  budget  for  editorial  space  and  expenditure 
the  editor  shall  retain  control  over  the  appointment,  disposition  and  dismissal  of 
journalists on his newspaper and of all other content of his newspaper.
Eighth, disputes between the editors and directors of the companies are to be settled 
by the independent national directors.”

2.34  Those conditions are included within the Articles of Association of Times Holdings Limited 

and still bind the company today.

2.35  The decision of the Secretary of State was controversial. The Labour MP, John Smith, called 
an emergency debate on the decision on the day that the Secretary of State’s consent was 
announced.  The  Opposition,  and  indeed  some  Government  backbenchers,44  argued  that 
the threat of closure was a device concocted by Thomson and colluded in by NI designed 
to force the Government’s hand. There were also allegations that the Prime Minister had 
influenced  the  Secretary  of  State’s  decision  as  a  favour  to  Rupert  Murdoch.  For  example, 
Geoffrey Robertson MP said:45

“In his first major decision the Right Hon. Gentleman has failed to stand up to the 
Prime Minister. That is the reality. I shall examine the facts and show why later. This 
is a straightforward pay-off for services rendered by The Sun. If it is not, let us see the 
facts and figures to show that I am wrong.”

2.36  Despite this opposition the deal had the support of the editorial staff and the unions, and 
went ahead. The purchase gave NI more than a 25% share of daily newspaper circulation and 
something over 30% of the Sunday market.

2.37  Although The Times has a reputation for taking a generally conservative approach to matters 
of  public  policy  and  social  issues,  its  support  for  political  parties  at  general  elections  has 
varied. Indeed, on occasion The Times and The Sunday Times have backed different parties. 
Most  recently,  The  Times  supported  the  Labour  Party  in  1997,  2001  and  2005  and  the 
Conservatives in 2010. By contrast, The Sunday Times supported the Conservative Party at 
each of those elections.46

2.38 

In February 2012 The Times had a circulation of 397,549. Although this is the second highest 
broadsheet circulation, it is some way behind the Daily Telegraph, and accounted for only 4.3% 
of national daily newspaper circulation in that month. By contrast, its sister paper The Sunday

105

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances CTimes had a circulation of 939,395 in February 2012, reflecting its different character. This is 
by some margin the highest national Sunday broadsheet circulation (the Sunday Telegraph 
has a circulation of just over 460,000), and gives The Sunday Times the fourth highest national 
Sunday circulation, accounting for nearly 8.5% of the national Sunday market.47

2.39  Unlike  The  Sun,  The  Times  and  The  Sunday  Times  have  put  their  online  content  behind 
paywalls.  This  approach  is  not  usual  for  UK  newspapers,  and  The  Times  has  the  smallest 
online audience of any of the major UK newspapers: as of March 2012 it was reported to have 
only 119,000 subscribers.48 This compares poorly to the Guardian’s website which attracts 
upwards of three million unique users each day and the Daily Mail website which receives in 
excess of 70 million hits each day.

News International governance structures

2.40  The NI Board now meets monthly to address issues of significance. The Inquiry was told that 
in October 2010 the Board included a News Corp representative and that a second would 
shortly be appointed.49 Subsequently, the Inquiry was informed that both Mr Murdoch and 
Janet Nova, Deputy Group General Counsel of News Corp, have stepped down from the NI 
board. Thomas Mockridge told the Inquiry that no NI executives sit on the News Corp Board:50

“I  am  satisfied  that  notwithstanding  these  changes  to  the  board,  the  appropriate 
oversight of the News International business is being maintained both at the local 
division and group levels and the board of directors of NI Group Limited continues to 
play a key role in ensuring the appropriate corporate governance standards of the 
company and its subsidiaries.”

2.41  Mr Mockridge told the Inquiry the NI Board has undertaken a review of compliance since July 

2011. He said:51

“... what we have sought to do is to update/refresh the whole range of compliance 
policies  and  in  particular  improve  the  communications  of  the  compliance  policies. 
My observation has been that even where an existing policy is completely thorough 
and appropriate, if it’s not well communicated, then it’s much more difficult to expect 
people to comply with it.”

2.42  The Inquiry has also been informed that the editors of The Times, The Sunday Times and The 
Sun will be required to attend these monthly NI Board meetings and report on performance 
and compliance.52 No information has been provided on past corporate governance practice 
at NI or governance procedures at NoTW.

PART C | The PressC2.43  The Corporate Audit Department of News Corp provides assurance on the effectiveness of 
operational and financial controls through audits carried out on the basis of an assessment 
of significant risks to News Corp. In 2012 such audits were planned at NI in relation to, inter 
alia, advertising revenue, circulation revenue, compliance with the UK Bribery Act and NI’s 
digital media operations.53

2.44  There  is  a  separate  Board  for  TNHL,  which  is  covered  by  the  undertakings  given  to  the 
Secretary of State for Trade following the acquisition of the titles in 1981. The TNHL Board 
must comprise no more than 20 directors of whom at least six must be ‘Independent National 
Directors’. A majority of the Independent National Directors is required for the appointment 
and dismissal of the editors of either of the titles or the disposal by NI of the titles. The TNHL 
Board meets quarterly54 and the editors of The Times and The Sunday Times attend and are 
expected to account for editorial coverage to the Board.55 The Independent Directors meet 
regularly with the Editor of The Times both at board meetings of TNHL and separately to 
discuss any on-going issues at the paper,56 and with the Editor of The Sunday Times.57 There 
are separate boards for Times Newspapers, News Group Newspapers and NI Trading, which 
meet as required.58

News International’s financial results

2.45  NI is now only a small but still important part of News Corp’s global business.59 Although The 
Sun is highly profitable, the relative profitability of the group has been in decline for a number 
of years. News Group News posted pre-tax profits of £88.6m for the 2009/2010 financial year, 
as well as an increase in revenue from £639m to £654m.60

2.46  By contrast, The Times and The Sunday Times have run at a loss for a number of years and 
have not made a profit since 2001.61 However, the decline in revenues at TNHL appears to 
have been halted though not fully reversed. TNHL reported a pre-tax loss of £45m for the 
financial year 2009/2010 compared with a pre-tax loss of £87.7m for the 2008-2009 financial 
year.62

2.47  Despite the strong performance by NGN, NI recorded a pre-tax loss of £78.5m for 2009/2010, 
compared with a profit of £34.7m for the 2009/2009 financial year. Much of this loss was 
attributable  to  the  costs  of  writing  down  a  £45m  loan  made  to  its  free  title,  The  London 
Paper, after the closure of that title in September 2009.

2.48  Over  the  same  period  NI’s  salary  bill  has  been  reduced  from  £11.7m  to  £8.8m.  However, 
overall staff costs at NI have increased from £16.7m to £19.4m as a consequence of increased 
share-based payments and a rise in pension costs.63

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances CNews International editorial independence

2.49  The position on editorial independence differs across the NI titles. The Times and The Sunday 
Times are guaranteed editorial independence pursuant to the 1981 undertakings. By contrast, 
Mr Murdoch takes an active interest in the editorial direction of the NGN titles, though the 
position in relation to The Sun and NoTW was far from identical. He told the Inquiry that:64

“I never much interfere with the News of the World, I’m sorry to say,”

but that he would exercise editorial control on major issues, such as the support for parties 
at a general election or policy on Europe.65 In contrast, he said of The Sun:66

“if any politician wanted my opinions on major matters, they only had to read the 
editorials in the Sun.”

News International financial management

2.50  The News Corp Corporate Audit Department  provides a check on operations, financial reporting 
and compliance.67 In particular this department’s audits cover the Editorial Commissioning 
System, Casual Management System (by which casual staff are paid), expenses system and 
NewsPeople.68 The accounts of NI, NGN and TNHL are audited by Ernst & Young.69 On account 
of its US listing, NI is required to comply with the financial certification requirements of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.70

2.51  The Editorial Finance Director is responsible for the accurate reporting of the editorial numbers. 
A Corporate Reporting Team and a Financial Accounting Team ensure that NI complies with 
the relevant accounting standards. A Taxation Team ensures that tax compliance is followed.71

2.52  Day to day legal and policy compliance is a matter for editors, delegated to deputy editors and 
senior sub editors.72 Financial matters are dealt with by the managing editors.73 Payments to 
third parties for editorial content must be authorised by the relevant desk head and managing 
editor, apart from in the case of NoTW where a desk head could alone authorise payments up 
to £2,000.74 Payments or annual entitlements of over £50,000 require authorisation from the 
Chief Financial Officer.75 Cash payments, without limit, can be made to third parties subject 
to prior approval by the managing editor and the editor or deputy editor.76 This has been 
strengthened since the introduction of the Bribery Act 2010, before which authorisation for

addition the journalist who requested the cash has to sign a book saying that they have had 
training in the Bribery Act and will comply with NI’s bribery policy.78

2.53  Expenses  can  be  claimed  through  an  online  system,  subject  to  authorisations  from  the 
Expense Administration Team and the Managing Editor’s office. Expenses where a receipt is 
not provided can be paid at the authoriser’s discretion.79

2.54  The  Times  rarely  pays  for  stories,  with  the  exception  of  book  serialisation  deals  with 
publishers.80 The Sunday Times pays fees to external sources of information, including local

News International policies and procedures

2.55  News Corp has a number of relevant policies that apply to its (and hence all NI) staff: Standards 
of Business Conduct, Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and the Record Retention, 
Policy.83  In  addition  there  are  a  number  of  NI  policies  that  apply  to  all  NI  staff,  including: 
the PCC Editor’s Code, a Contracts Policy, an Approvals Authority Policy, an Expenses Policy, 
the Disciplinary and Dismissal Procedure, a Conflicts of Interest Policy and Data Protection 
Policies.84  Following  the  events  at  NoTW  many  of  these  policies  are  being  or  have  been 
revised, leading to the addition of a Whistleblowing Policy and helpline,85 a Payment Policy86 
which sets out the procedure which must be followed in order for journalists to pay sources 
for stories, a Workplace Conduct Policy87 and an NI Anti-Bribery policy which supplements 
the News Corp Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy.88

2.56 

In  addition  NI  has  created  a  new  role  of  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  to  be  responsible  for 
ensuring company-wide and title-wide compliance with the law and company policies89 and 
reporting directly to the CEO. The compliance officer has been tasked with reviewing and, 
where necessary updating, all NI policies, working closely with the in-house legal teams and 
the managing editors.90

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C2.57  All  new  employment  contracts  will  require  compliance  with  company  policies  and,  in  the 
case of reporters or journalists, with the PCC Code, and existing contracts will be revised to 
include these provisions where they are not already there,91 although the Inquiry was told 
that for journalists with The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun compliance with the PCC 
code  is  already  a  contractual  requirement.92  The  Sunday  Times  is  also  drawing  up  formal 
understandings with freelancers to require them to abide by the law and the PCC Code.93

2.58  Until recently NI had no procedures governing the employment of private investigators. New 
rules are being introduced which make the engagement of a private investigator subject to 
approval by the Chief Executive.94 At The Sunday Times the rules on the use of subterfuge 
have been revised, with prior approval now required from the legal team, the editor and 
the managing editor,95 and discussions as well as any legal advice are to be documented.96 
Historically, in the NoTW, private investigators were employed by the news desk to provide 
various services, including surveillance, supporting undercover investigations and provisions 
of data.97 Evidence has been provided that the news desk, rather than reporters, instructed 
these private investigators.98

News International management structures and processes

2.59  This section provides a brief overview of the management structures and day-to-day working 
practices at NI. The NI Executive Management Team (consisting of the heads of NI’s various 
divisions, the three editors and the CEO) meets weekly to discuss day to day business issues 
and  to  draw  the  CEO’s  attention  to  issues  of  significance.99  At  title  level  the  three  editors 
have ultimate responsibility for ensuring that their staff behave lawfully, professionally and 
ethically.100

2.60  At The Times, the heads of each section (e.g. business editor, head of news) report to the 
editor, who is assisted by the deputy editor, managing editor and executive editors. The vast 
majority of reporters are staff, and are on site daily, discussing news stories with their editors. 
Journalists are expected to discuss and explain lines of enquiry and methods of obtaining a 
story. There is an emphasis on transparency and continuous debate and discussion.101

2.61  At The Sunday Times the managing editor (News) is in overall charge of news coverage, and the 
news editor and foreign editor report to him. Difficult ethical or legal questions are discussed 
with the editor and the in-house legal team. The system operates on trust but with stringent 
control by the news desk, managing editor (News) and other departmental heads.102

PART C | The PressC2.62  At The Sun there is a daily news conference chaired by the editor at which proposed stories 
are discussed. The editor is responsible for ensuring that The Sun’s corporate governance 
system works and is adhered to. Day to day issues of corporate governance are delegated to 
the managing editor.103

News International incentives

2.63  Staff on The Sun are paid bonuses depending on personal performance, including the stories 
that the individual has produced.104 NoTW ran a monthly ‘merit’ scheme with awards being 
in the region of £500.105

News International oversight by readers

2.64  The Times has a ‘feedback editor’ who acts as an ombudsman, with a weekly column airing 
readers’ concerns.106 “You, the editor” invites readers to give their views on the previous day’s 
paper.107 At The Sunday Times the editor has appointed the associate editor as ombudsman 
to take an independent view of any complaint and recommend a correction and apology or 
defend the newspaper as appropriate.108

BSkyB: history and context

2.65  The detail of News Corp’s ownership of satellite television broadcaster BSkyB is dealt with in 
detail in the context of its recent bid for full ownership of BSkyB.109 However, at this stage I 
examine the early involvement of News Corp in satellite broadcasting in the UK.

2.66  NI acquired 65% of the struggling Satellite Television Ltd in 1984 for a nominal £1 and re-
launched the company as the Sky Channel. The company continued to be loss making, losing 
£10m in 1987. Problems with the satellite technology meant that it was primarily a cable 
channel in the UK until 1989, when it moved to the newly launched Astra Satellite, based 
in Luxembourg, which made reception in the UK much easier, and its four channels were 
marketed primarily to the UK. Until 1990 it was the only satellite serving the UK.

2.67  The  Independent  Broadcasting  Authority  (IBA)  awarded  a  DBS  (Direct  Broadcasting  via 
Satellite) service licence to British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) in late 1988. BSB was required 
by its licence to use a different technology to that then successfully in use by Sky, and was 
bedevilled by technical problems, not being able to launch until March 1990. The BBC had 
also proposed its own satellite service, going as far as signing a ‘heads of agreement’ on the 
construction of two satellites in March 1986, but this service never launched.110 This meant 
that the two satellite services being marketed to the UK ran on different technical standards 
and  needed  different  dishes  (and  different  receivers)  so  that  they  were  placed  in  direct 
competition with each other for customers who would only be able to receive one service or 
the other.

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C2.68 

In  1989  the  Broadcasting  Bill  was  introduced  to  Parliament,  which  contained  provisions 
relating to the licensing of satellite services. The Bill placed a number of licence conditions 
(impartiality and accuracy of news; not offending against good taste or decency; not inciting 
crime or disorder; and not offending against public feeling) on BSB, but not on Sky.

2.69  During  debate  on  the  Bill  amendments  were  proposed  to  extend  cross  media  ownership 
restrictions to the holders of a domestic or non domestic satellite service.111 In practical terms 
this would have required NI to divest the Sky Channel, but might also have had an implication 
for other publishers who held stakes in BSB. These amendments were defeated and the Act 
became law without any cross media ownership provisions affecting the holders of satellite 
broadcast licences.

2.70 

In November 1990, within days of the Broadcasting Act 1990 receiving Royal Assent but before 
the regulatory changes had taken effect, it was announced that BSB and Sky were going to 
merge.  The  Home  Office  was  formally  notified  of  the  merger  on  2  November  1990,  with 
a formal public announcement being made by the two companies, and the merger taking 
place, on 3 November, resulting in the creation of BSkyB. At the time, the merger was covered 
by the Broadcasting Act 1981, under which BSB’s direct broadcasting satellite service was 
provided under a contract with the International Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the regulator 
at the time. Under the 1981 Act an IBA contract for satellite broadcasting could be ended or 
suspended by the IBA or the Secretary of State if a newspaper proprietor had an interest in 
a contractor and “the existence of those shareholdings has led, or is leading to results which 
are contrary to the public interest.” The IBA was not informed of the merger in advance of it 
taking place.112

2.71  Under  the  terms  of  BSB’s  contract  with  the  IBA  it  was  obliged  to  get  the  approval  of  the 
regulator for any merger. That approval was not sought in advance. In the event this proved 
immaterial  as  the  merged  company  then  broadcast  solely  from  the  Astra  satellite,  thus 
removing the need for an IBA licence.113 The merger also took the newly formed company 
out of the full licensing regime that the 1990 Act would have imposed on BSB as a domestic 
satellite service.

2.72  For over a decade BSkyB provided the only satellite broadcasting service directed primarily at 
UK viewers. The service was available only with subscription, and with a combination of strong 
marketing and exclusive programming the proportion of households with Sky subscriptions 
grew from the extremely low levels in 1990 to nearly six million in 2002, and over ten million 
in 2011. The BBC moved to make its channels available free to air from satellite in 2003 but, 
as they were the only channels being broadcast from the satellite without encryption and 
therefore free to view, take up was limited. Over subsequent years ITV and Channel 5 joined 
the BBC in offering free to air satellite broadcasts, and Sky added a ‘freesat from Sky’ offer 
which allows consumers to take free to air satellite services from Sky. BSkyB now competes 
against both free to air digital terrestrial and satellite services and subscription based services 
via  cable.  Increasingly  there  is  additional  competition  from  on  demand  services  provided 
over broadband.

PART C | The PressC2.73  BSkyB is now a significant part of News Corp’s direct satellite broadcasting business, which 
consists of the whole of SKY Italia, which now has 5 million subscribers, 39.14% of BSkyB, 
and significant holdings in Sky Deutschland; TATA SKY in Asia and FOXTEL in Australia and 
New Zealand. Direct Satellite broadcasting is a relatively small part of News Corp’s activities, 
contributing only 11.5% of revenues in 2010. Financially BSkyB went from making a loss of 
over £700m in 1991 to delivering revenue of over £6.5 billion and profit of £1.073 billion in 
2011.114 BSkyB is a Plc, traded on the London Stock Exchange, and News Corp owns 39.14% 
of the shares, which for practical purposes is a controlling shareholding. As of 30 September 
2012, just over 10.5m subscribers held a subscription with BSkyB.115

BSkyB governance

2.74  The  BSkyB  Board  consists  of  14  Directors.  The  Chief  Executive  and  Chief  Financial  Officer 
are the only executive Directors on the Board. There are nine independent non-executives, 
including the Chairman, three non-execs from News Corp and the Chief Executive of NI.116

2.75 

James  Murdoch  was  CEO  of  BSkyB  from  2003  to  2007,  then  becoming  non-executive 
Chairman. He stepped down as Chairman on 3 April 2012, saying:

“As  attention  continues  to  be  paid  to  past  events  at  News  International,  I  am 
determined that the interests of BSkyB should not be undermined by matters outside 
the scope of this company. I am aware that my role as Chairman could become a 
lightening rod for BSkyB and I believe that my resignation will help ensure that there 
is no false conflation with events at a separate organisation.”117

He retains a non-executive Director seat on the BSkyB Board.

Sky News

2.76  Through its Sky News subsidiary, BskyB is both a broadcaster and provider of broadcast news 
content. Sky News broadcasts continuous rolling news, it is also a major provider of news 
services to commercial radio stations and has contracts to provide news content to Channel 
4 and Channel 5.118 Like all other broadcast news providers, Sky News is bound by the terms 
of the Broadcasting Code.

2.77  According to Ofcom, Sky News had in October 2010 an average weekly reach of some 24% 
of the wholesale news market, equivalent to 11.7m people per week, and 9.9% of the retail 
news market, or some 5m people per week.119 Ofcom has estimated that Sky News’ share of 
national and international news television viewing is around 6% of the news market.120 This 
is less than the 70% market share enjoyed by the BBC and the 18% by ITV.121 Sky News’ share 
of the radio market is, in comparison, much larger. In October 2010 it had an average weekly 
reach of 33.4m people.122

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C2.78  The  Inquiry  has  heard  some  evidence  on  the  corporate  governance  procedures  operated 
at  Sky  News.  This  was  provided  by  John  Ryley,  Head  of  News  at  Sky  News.  Mr  Ryley  was 
invited to give evidence to the Inquiry in relation to the unauthorised access of private email 
accounts by the journalist Gerard Tubbs in relation to two stories broadcast by Sky News in 
2008 and 2010.123

2.79  Mr Ryley described in some detail the informal, but thorough processes in place at Sky News, 
and revealed that discussions around whether to pursue each story as well as decisions to 
authorise the unauthorised access of the email accounts in question were had and made, 
together with the taking of appropriate legal advice, at senior editorial levels. 124

2.80  Mr Ryley also said that as a consequence of the broadcast of the two stories in question, Sky 
News would look to introduce a formal process requiring, should the situation arise, formal 
written authorisation to be sought either from the head of news or the appropriate editor 
designate.125

History
The Daily Mail was launched in 1896 by Harold and Alfred Harmsworth. The company was 
incorporated as the Daily Mail & General Trust (DMGT) in 1922 and listed on the London stock 
exchange  in  1933.  Alfred  Harmsworth  (later  Viscount  Northcliffe)  also  founded  the  Daily 
Mirror in 1903 and took over the Observer in 1905, and The Times and The Sunday Times 
in 1908. Alfred Harmsworth died in 1922 without an heir, and control of DMGT passed to 
Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. The Times was sold to Viscount Astor in 1922. 
Viscount Rothermere disposed of his interest in the Daily Mirror in 1939. The Harmsworth 
family have remained owners of a substantial part of DMGT, and have continuously held the 
post of Chairman since the company was founded.

Viscount  Rothermere,  the  current  owner  of  DMGT  has  given  evidence  to  the  Inquiry 
explaining the ethos and nature of the Mail Newspaper Group. Viscount Rothermere told the 
Inquiry that he firmly believes in taking “pride in our products and services.”126 He has said 
that DMGT has been built on his personal and family values, and that these values resonate 
and are replicated across the Mail group of newspapers.127 Viscount Rothermere also told 
the Inquiry that the popularity of the Daily Mail resides with the broad spectrum of news 
content that is offered by the title – it provides something for everyone. In their initial written 
submission to the Inquiry, Associated News further explained this appeal in their description 
of the Daily Mail:128

“…in touch with the hearts and minds of ‘Middle England’. It reflects their concerns, 
hopes and lifestyle. Top of the agenda is reporting the news and asking the tough 
questions.  With its campaigning  stance, it is not afraid  to expose the wrongs and 
shortcomings of people in power and with the vocal backing of its 5 million readers 
can be an effective force for change.”

The growth of the MailOnline, now the most popular newspaper website in the world, is 
also testament to the enduring appeal of the breadth of content, and in particular, celebrity 
news, offered by the Mail newspapers. Viscount Rothermere has described the MailOnline as 
having made a “global footprint.”129

The Mail has traditionally been politically conservative, supporting the Conservative Party 
at  every  general  election  since  1945.130  When  giving  evidence  to  the  Inquiry,  the  current 
editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, has said that the Daily Mail propounds the virtues of family life, of 
traditional matrimony and traditional values.131

The Mail Group today
DMGT  today  operates  in  over  forty  countries  with  a  substantial  portfolio  of  media  and 
information companies providing content, information, analytics and events for businesses 
and  consumers.  In  2010  DMGT’s  revenue  was  nearly  £2bn,  with  operating  profit  for  the 
year running at £320m. DMGT employs 12,000 people and only just over a quarter of its 
profits come from its consumer facing businesses. DMGT comprises five divisions, only one of 
which, A&N Media, is involved with publishing newspapers. A&N Media includes Associated 
Newspapers, which publishes UK national newspapers.

Associated Newspapers is highly profitable and employs over 4,300 staff. In 2010, it showed a 
substantial increase in profits, despite a small percentage fall in revenues.132 In the 2010/2011 
financial year, Associated Newspapers had revenues of £850m, with an operating profit of 
£95m.  This  makes  Associated  Newspapers  by  some  way  the  most  successful  newspaper 
concern in the UK in purely cash terms, to say nothing of the global reach of its online content.

Northcliffe Media publishes ninety publications in the UK, including thirteen paid-for daily 
titles, two free daily titles, twenty-five paid-for weeklies, two weekly classified titles, eighteen 
monthly magazines and twenty-nine free weekly newspapers, in addition to a network of 
local websites that attracted five million unique users in September 2011. Northcliffe Media 
employs 2,531 people and through deduction from the Annual Report had in 2011 revenues 
of £248m and an operating loss of £2m.

Associated  Newspapers  publishes  the  Daily  Mail,  the  Mail  on  Sunday,  the  Metro  and 
MailOnline.  The  Daily  Mail  has  a  circulation  of  just  over  2m,  which  is  the  second  highest 
national title circulation (after The Sun at 2.7m), and accounted for some 21% of national 
daily newspaper circulation in February 2012.133 The Metro, launched in 1999, is a free daily 
newspaper distributed in all major urban centres in the UK. It has a circulation of 1.38m and 
readership  of  3.4m.134  The  Mail  on  Sunday  had  a  circulation  of  1.8m  in  February  2012.135 
Following the demise of News of the World this was the highest Sunday circulation, but was 
topped by the Sun on Sunday at its launch in February 2012 with a circulation of just over 
3.2m. The February 2012 circulation figures for the Mail on Sunday account for just under 
17% of national Sunday circulation.

The picture would be incomplete without some reference to the phenomenal growth of the 
MailOnline. The MailOnline is the most popular UK newspaper website and the most visited 
newspaper site in the world. The website receives on average a daily viewing audience of 5.6m 
people, of which 2.2m are readers in the UK and 1.7m in the USA.136 The content produced for 
the MailOnline is edited separately to that of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday. However, 
the MailOnline reproduces much of the content published in the printed titles, in addition to 
its own, often US focused content.137

Governance structures

3.10  Associated  News  Limited  publishes  the  Daily  Mail,  the  Mail  on  Sunday,  the  Metro  and 
MailOnline. Associated News Limited is part of A&N Media, which is, itself, part of DMGT, a 
publicly listed company quoted on the UK Stock Exchange.138 Our focus here is on A&N Media, 
and within that on Associated Newspapers. A&N Media also includes Northcliffe Media.

Associated News Boards

3.11  The DMGT Board comprises nine executive directors and seven non-executives. The Chair 
and Chief Executive of A&N Media and the editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers sit on 
the DMGT Board. The DMGT Risk Committee has responsibility for all group risk, including 
risk  arising  from  editorial  matters,  including  where  appropriate  recommending  changes 
to existing practices.139 In addition the Information Security Committee includes within its 
remit responsibility for data protection in the company, including third party data held by the 
company.140

Associated News editorial independence

3.12  The DMGT Board are not involved in the editorial process, nor do they have any proprietorial 
influence  on  published  content.  The  editors  of  Associated  Newspapers  have  complete 
editorial  independence  over  the  content  published  in  individual  DMGT  titles.  The  editors 
of Associated Newspapers report to the Chair of DMGT and the editor-in-chief, not to the 
commercial  management  of  the  organisation.141  The  exception  to  this  is  the  Editor  of  the 
MailOnline, who, in addition to reporting to the editor-in-chief on editorial issues, reports 
also to the Managing Director of Associated Newspapers on business matters.142

3.13  Mr Dacre, has given evidence as to the extent of this editorial freedom, and stressed that:143

“…just as I am given the freedom to edit by our management, I leave the individual 
editors of the titles – it can’t be any other way. You can’t edit by remote control.”

PART C | The PressC3.14  Mr Dacre has also suggested that the editorial freedom that he is granted as editor-in-chief of 
the Mail Group of newspaper by the DMGT Board is not necessarily something extended to 
newspaper editors working for other concerns. He has told the Inquiry that:144

“…I  have  turned  down  editorships  of  The  Times  and  The  Telegraph.  One  reason  I 
did so is that at the Mail I enjoy total freedom from proprietorial and managerial 
interference, a freedom that is not necessarily found in other newspaper groups.”

3.15  To  this  extent,  he  has  suggested  that  the  personal  views  of  Mr  Murdoch  have  influenced 
editorial decision making at the NI titles. Mr Dacre cited that newspaper group’s coverage 
of the second Iraq conflict, which provided support for the Labour Government’s decision 
to  go  to  war  in  Iraq.  He  told  the  Inquiry  his  view  that  it  would  have  been  difficult,  if  not 
impossible, for the Labour Government to have proceeded with this decision, without the 
support received through Mr Murdoch’s newspapers.145

Associated News financial management

3.16  New  systems  of  approving  and  recording  payments  to  third  parties  were  established  at 
Associated Newspapers following the introduction of the Bribery Act 2010. These require: 
prior approval from department heads; documentation of the payment; an explanation of 
why the payment is necessary, including any public interest issue where appropriate; and 
where  it  involves  an  employee  acting  against  their  employer,  the  information  presented 
must be assessed as well as justified. This system applies to freelance journalists working at 
Associated Newspapers when they need to make payments to third parties in pursuit of a 
story for the company.146

3.17 

In addition to normal relationships with news agencies, fees to third parties are sometimes 
paid. These could be fees to freelancers (either for information or for journalism), fees to the 
public for information, fees to the public for the right to tell their story, or fees to the public 
for pictures.147

3.18  Payments can be made in cash in a limited number of circumstances, and can be to anonymous 
sources.  Each  desk  will  have  delegated  authority  to  approve  payments  up  to  an  agreed 
level. Above that level, the approval of the editor or deputy editor is required. Where larger 
sums are involved, for example in regard to ‘buy-ups’, there will normally be senior editorial 
discussion and the payments would be subject to contractual documentation.148

Associated News policies and procedures

3.19  Compliance with the Editors’ Code of Practice is a contractual requirement for all journalists 
employed  at  Associated  News.149  Additionally,  it  has  been  a  contractual  requirement  for 
all ANL journalists, and any freelance journalists working for ANL, to comply with the Data 
Protection  Act.  Any  complaints  to  the  PCC,  and  guidance  from  them,  is  reflected  in  legal 
notices circulated to editorial staff and relevant legal advisors.150 The editor-in-chief’s policy 
is that:151

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C“…one  of  the  most  important  things…  a  newspaper  can  do  is  to  employ  first  rate 
reporters, writers and subs who are more concerned than anybody to ensure that 
their journalism is of the highest professional standards.”

3.20  Mr  Dacre  explained  to  the  Inquiry  that  clear  lines  of  communication  exist  between  staff, 
department  heads  and  the  managing  editors.  In  this  respect,  the  company  ensures  that 
presence of the managing editors on the newsroom floor is constant. Mr Dacre said that:152

“If, for example, a reporter was asked to do something he or she was unhappy about, 
or a head of department was unhappy about signing off payment, there is no reason 
why they would not feel able to discuss this with the managing editors…”

ANL also has a Data Protection Policy,153 and a staff handbook which includes a whistleblowers’ 
procedure and a ‘speak up’ policy.154

3.21  Compliance with the Editors’ Code of Practice is a particular responsibility of managing editors, 
together with company’s in-house lawyers, who are not involved in editorial decision making 
and  who  staff  should  approach  with  any  concerns  related  to  compliance  with  the  Code. 
managing editors ensure that all staff are kept aware of any changes to the Code and also 
have copies of the latest version. PCC training and refresher sessions are also used to ensure 
compliance with the Code.155 The Inquiry has been told that training is a key part of ANL’s 
approach to embedding ethics and compliance with the code within the organisation across 
the range of responsibilities. Disciplinary action has been taken by ANL against journalists on 
occasion in respect of breaches of the code.156

3.22 

It is made clear to all journalists working for ANL that failure to abide by the Editors’ Code of 
Practice will have serious consequences for them, the editor and the company.157 Examples 
of letters to staff and instructions from the managing editors, legal warnings from the legal 
department and disciplinary action have been disclosed to the Inquiry.158

3.23  Since  April  2007  there  has  been  an  outright  ban  on  ANL  staff  using  private  investigators 
and search agencies.159 As well as informing all ANL Journalists of the ban, the Inquiry has 
been  told  that  ANL  have  also  written  to  every  agency  previously  used  by  ANL  employees 
stating that any further use of their services was unauthorised and would not be paid for 
by the company. This has only been breached once, which resulted in the dismissal of the 
staff  member  responsible.160  ANL  retains  three  commercial  relationships  with  information 
search services in relation to genealogy, business information and tracing, each of which the 
company is satisfied complies with DPA requirements.161

PART C | The PressC3.24  Any staff who believe they have access to, or want to access, material in breach of the DPA 
are required to contact the editor or deputy editor and where there are compelling public 
interest reasons to proceed, those reasons should be recorded in writing.162

3.25  Associated News has an Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy, a policy on Working with Third 
Parties and a policy on Gifts and Hospitality. Introduction of new procedures relating to these 
policies were undertaken in light of the introduction of the Bribery Act 2010. All staff must 
comply with these policies and promptly report any concerns or violations.163

Associated News management structures and processes

3.26  Editorial departments at Associated Newspapers are hierarchical organisations.164 Reporters 
make the initial judgment on the quality and source of the information they are dealing with, 
and whether it is publishable with regard to issues of libel, privacy, data protection and taste. 
If they have doubts about the accuracy of the information or how it was obtained they have 
to discuss it with their head of department, who in turn must discuss it with senior editorial 
executives, who may make other investigations or consult the deputy editor or other senior 
executives.165 Sub-editors are encouraged to check facts where it is appropriate to do so.166 
The editor will in turn scrutinise their decisions and may make his own enquiries if he has any 
reason to doubt the accuracy of the story or the methods used to obtain the story.167

3.27  The current editor of the MailOnline, Martin Clarke, told the Inquiry that he applies the same 
standards of reporting and appropriate checks involved in the publication of stories on the 
website as the company’s print journalists would do.168

3.28  Editors are assisted in any such decision making by the managing editors. It is the role of 
the managing editors to investigate complaints and alleged breaches of the Editors’ Code 
of Practice if, and when, they arise, while at the same time educating journalists about any 
new developments to or requirements of the Code, and must be proactive in ensuring that 
the Code is not breached.169 The Inquiry has been told that Managing Editors are a constant 
presence  on  the  editorial  floor,  independent  of  other  departments  and  not  involved  in 
editorial decision-making, save where they are seeking to ensure that a legal or PCC warning 
is noted.170 Paul Dacre has made clear that one of their core functions is to:171

Associated News incentives

3.29  The  editor-in-chief  and  other  ANL  editors  may  receive  share  options  as  part  of  their 
remuneration but these are tied to DMGT’s overall financial performance, and not editorial 
performance.172 Mr Dacre, told the Inquiry that he also received a “one-off lifetime bonus” 
which was taken in 2010.173

4.  northern and shell Media group Ltd
4.1 

Northern and Shell is a privately owned company, founded and owned by Richard Desmond. 
The Daily Express Group was acquired by Mr Desmond on 22 November 2000.174 In its formal 
submission to the Inquiry, Northern and Shell have described the Daily Express as “the world’s 
greatest newspaper”,175 and that it:176

“…covers world and domestic events in depth and with style, it leads opinions and 
tell the truth intelligently, fearlessly and with attitude. It engages the modern reader 
with a unique mix of news, features, sport, health, money matters, columnists and 
entertainment… [it] spearhead[s] the values of middle Britain.”

4.2 

4.3 

Perhaps more prosaically, Mr Desmond has told the Inquiry that his only interest in acquiring 
the Express Group was the commercial opportunity that it offered.177 Echoing the importance 
of the commercial  interests of the Express Group’s owner, the current editor of the Daily 
Express, Hugh Whittow, has told the Inquiry that his priority for the title is to keep it: “buoyant, 
popular and profitable, and hopefully keep and encourage more readers.”178

The  Daily  Express  has  traditionally  supported  the  Conservative  Party.  Although  the  paper 
backed the Labour Party in the 2001 general election under the editorship of Rosie Boycott, 
the paper returned its support to the Conservative Party ahead of the 2005 general election.179 
The then editor, Peter Hill, explained the reason for that change in allegiance to the Inquiry:180

“…the entire history of the Daily Express had been that of a right-of-centre newspaper. 
It has an enormous constituency of readers who supported that view, and I felt that it 
had been a huge mistake to move the newspaper to support the Labour Party, which 
had been done by previous editors and administrations, and it had, in fact, cost the 
newspaper an enormous number of readers who had abandoned it in despair.”

History
The  Daily  Express  was  founded  by  Arthur  Pearson  in  1900.  In  1916  the  newspaper  was 
purchased by Max Aitken, later Lord Beaverbrook. Beaverbrook was unashamed about the 
political use he made of his newspapers. In this respect the Beaverbrook Foundation said:181

“it will be for his role as a pioneer of newspapers and for his ability to form public 
opinion that Beaverbrook will be ultimately remembered.”

Under  Beaverbrook’s  ownership  the  Daily  Express  became  one  of  the  most  popular  daily 
newspapers in the UK. Its circulation grew from 2.33m in 1938 to 4.3m in 1960.182 However, 
its circulation fell after Lord Beaverbrook’s death in 1964 and in 1977 the Daily Express was 
bought by the construction company Trafalgar House. In 1978 Trafalgar House launched the 
Daily Star, initially circulated only in the North and the Midlands. In 1982 Trafalgar House 
incorporated its newspaper publishing interests into a new company, Fleet Holdings, which 
was purchased by United Newspapers in 1985. In 2000, Express Newspapers, which at the 
point included the Daily Express, the Daily Star and the Sunday Express, was purchased by 
Northern and Shell, a company owned by Richard Desmond.

The Northern & Shell Media Group was founded in December 1974 by Richard Desmond, 
who continues to own it.183 The group began publishing music magazines and expanded into 
a wider range of magazines as well as into advertising and insurance. The group acquired 
Express Newspapers in November 2000 and Channel 5 in July 2010.184 The Northern & Shell 
Media Group currently comprises newspapers (the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily 
Star  and  Daily  Star  Sunday),  printing  and  distribution,  magazines  (OK!,  New!  and  Star), 
Television (Channel 5 and a number of subscription and pay per view channels) and digital 
media (a stake in the internet television service, YouView, on demand video, websites of its 
print publications and other web services).185

In 2010 Northern and Shell Media Group had a turnover of £496.3m, with operating profit of 
£36m.186 Group turnover in 2010 from publishing and printing (newspapers and magazines) 
was £347m, with operating profit of £43.7m. The circulation of the Daily Express in February 
2012 stood at 577,543, the sixth highest circulation for a national newspaper. Although this is 
just below the circulation of the Daily Telegraph (on 578,774), the Express has a significantly 
smaller readership than The Sun, Daily Mail, and Daily Mirror and fractionally less than its sister 
title, the Daily Star, which has the fourth highest circulation at 617,082. This gives the Daily 
Express and the Daily Star 6.3% and 6.8% of national daily newspaper circulation respectively, 
giving N&S Group a 13.1% share of national daily newspaper circulation. In February 2012 
the circulation of the Daily Star Sunday and the Sunday Express was 599,078 and 567,800 
respectively, which equates to 5.4% and 5.1% of the national share, and accounts for some 
10.5% of national Sunday newspaper circulation.187

4.9 

The  Board  consists  of  five  Executive  Directors  including  the  Group  Editorial  Director,  who 
assumes the role of Board Director, in charge of the creative functions of the organisation.188 
The Board does not have any members who are the editors of the Northern and Shell titles.

The Board has the responsibility for the administration and business functions of Northern 
and Shell. In January 2011, it took the decision to withdraw Express Newspapers from the 
Press Complaints Commission (PCC).189

Northern and Shell editorial independence

4.10  The Inquiry has been told that the members of the Northern and Shell Board has no influence 
over the editorial content carried by the Express Newspaper titles. Mr Desmond has further 
told  the  Inquiry  that  individual  editors  are  responsible  for  determining  the  tone  of  the 
newspapers  they  manage  and  have  complete  independence  in  terms  of  the  content  they 
publish. 190 He has said that Editors:191

“…decide the stories that go in the papers and leave the directors and the administration 
side of the company to look after the business issues.”

4.11  The  decision  made  by  the  former  Editor  of  the  Daily  Express,  Peter  Hill,  to  support  the 
Conservative Party ahead of the 2005 general election, was taken with the approval of the 
Board, although Mr Hill emphasised in evidence that the decision was ultimately his. He has 
explained:192

“It had qualified support, because the chairman, Mr Desmond, was a strong supporter 
of Mr Blair, who was then the Prime Minister, and he was not really a -- he was not 
a supporter of the Conservative Party, but he accepted that this was the appropriate 
thing to do.”

4.12  Mr Desmond  also  stressed the  independence  of  the editor in  reaching  that  decision,  and 
mused as to whether Mr Hill’s decision might have impacted adversely on his relationship 
with the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He noted that:193

“…at the end of the day Peter Hill runs the editorial of the paper and that was the 
decision that he made.”

PART C | The PressCNorthern and Shell financial governance

4.13  Corporate  Governance  at  the  Northern  and  Shell  is  primarily  achieved  through  financial 
control and, particularly, the imposition of strict budgeting and financial oversight. Following 
the  purchase  of  Express  Newspapers,  Northern  and  Shell  implemented  new  systems  in 
November  2000  intended  to  effect  more  effective  control  of  expenses  and  invoices.  Any 
expenses which exceed £5,000 must be signed off by a director at the group.194 The Managing 
Director samples payments to ensure they are appropriate and approves all editorial expenses 
claims.195 Cash payments are rarely used but are handled as staff expenses, which require 
approval by the relevant editor and managing editor.

Northern and Shell policies and procedures

4.14  Express Newspapers has a staff handbook which before 2001 was given to all staff and which 
is still available to staff on request.196 That handbook included the Editors’ Code of Practice 
and stated that editors and journalists must comply with it.197 Gareth Morgan, editor of the 
Star on Sunday, told the Inquiry that he has sought to ensure that hard copies of the Editors’ 
Code of Practice are distributed throughout his newsroom, and that this is done each time 
the Code is revised.198 The Northern and Shell staff handbook also includes a requirement that 
employees should comply with any company policies in force in this regard. It also includes 
a requirement that staff should seek to minimise the risk of expensive and damaging legal 
action.199

4.15  Although  Northern  and  Shell  is  not  a  member  of  the  PCC,  the  legal  team  expect  to  work 
in accordance with the standards set down in the Editors’ Code of Practice.200 Rather than 
responding to complaints made by members of the public or by affected parties through the 
PCC, instead Northern and Shell has established a Committee, comprising all the editors, the 
Group Editorial Director and the legal department, which sits on an ad hoc basis to look at any 
complaints received relating to the company’s publications.201

4.16  At present, there are no specific documents setting out the policies around anti-bribery or 
information gathering. Northern and Shell are in the process of issuing an anti-bribery and 
corruption policy following the enactment of the Bribery Act 2010.202

4.17  There  are  no  rules  on  the  employment  of  private  investigators  and  search  agents.203  The

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances Cdepartment of Express Newspapers, or the editors of the Express titles. In this regard, Nicole 
Patterson, Head of Legal at Express Newspapers informed the Inquiry that:204

“…I can’t say as far as we were aware because until we started having a look at this, 
I didn’t even know that we used these search agencies.”

4.18  Dawn Neesom, the current editor of the Daily Star, told the Inquiry that it was the investigations 
of Express Newspaper’s legal department into unusually large payments made in expenses 
claims,  which  revealed  the  extent  of  the  Daily  Star’s  use  of  external  search  agencies.  Ms 
Neesom said that as editor of the title she should have been made aware sooner that these 
practices had been taking place but was not.205 Ms Neesom explained that a specific policy 
in relation to the use of external providers of information did not exist at the Daily Star. The 
expectation  now  is  that  her  newsroom  operates  within  the  limits  of  the  Editors’  Code  of 
Practice;206 the Northern and Shell staff handbook, and the financial systems set in place by 
the Board.207

4.19  Mr  Whittow,  also  told  the  Inquiry  that  he  was  unaware  of  the  use  of  search  agencies  by 
his  journalists.  He  said  that  he  received  the  same  assurances  as  Ms  Neesom.  Similarly, 
he  assumed  that  any use  of  the  search  agencies  would  have been  conducted  “within  the 
confines of the law.”208 In contrast, the use of search agencies at the Daily Star Sunday, was 
undertaken with the knowledge of the editor. Mr Morgan, told the Inquiry that payments 
to search agencies are authorised  through the Assistant News Editor, Jonathan Corke. Mr 
Morgan told the Inquiry that he:209

“…speak[s] to Mr Corke on a regular basis to make sure that if we are instructing a 
search agency, we are doing the right thing.”

4.20  The Inquiry has not heard any evidence to suggest that the Express Newspaper titles have 
implemented a formal whistle-blowing policy. Instead, Ms Neesom told the Inquiry that she 
operates an ‘open-door policy’ for her staff at the Daily Star, but was unable to differentiate 
between  that  process  and  an  official  policy  for  her  employees.  She  told  that  Inquiry  that 
journalists:210

“…can go to human resources. We don’t – I’ve never had a whistle-blowing experience, 
to be honest with you.”

PART C | The PressCNorthern and Shell management structures and processes

4.21  The  editor  of  each  Northern  and  Shell  title  is  responsible  for  the  staff  who  work  on  that 
title.211 Journalists report to their head of department, who in turn reports to the deputy 
editor, who reports to the editor.212 The news and pictures’ desk, and individual reporters, 
have responsibility for verifying sources of information for their stories.213 Ms Patterson told 
the Inquiry that:214

“…I expect that when I’m presented with a story or some copy for legalling that the 
journalist will have done their job and that those facts will be correct, and if there is 
a legal problem with any of them, then I ask them, “where did it come from? How did 
it come about?”

4.22  Editors have a responsibility to ensure that the policies for lawful, professional and ethical 
conduct are adhered to in practice.215 The Inquiry has been told that editors at the group 
check throughout the day on all stories and pictures that are being printed.216 Sources for 
stories are discussed at editorial meetings which take place throughout the day, at which 
unusual articles and sources of information for those articles will be discussed.217

5.  trinity Mirror plc
5.1 

Trinity Mirror describes the Daily Mirror as:

“…a unique balance of real news, real entertainment and sport” and says that it’s 
core values are “compassion, conviction and courage”.218

Since the 1930s the Mirror has been a left-wing newspaper, and has supported the Labour 
party at every general election since 1945.219 Richard Wallace, editor of the Daily Mirror at 
the time he gave his evidence, said that the fact that he had met more often with Labour 
leaders than with the Conservative leader is a reflection of the paper’s political stance.220

5.2 

Lloyd Embley , then the editor of the Daily Mirror’s sister title, the People, and now the editor 
of the Daily Mirror, described the People as providing:221

“…a combination of news, showbusiness and celebrities, football coverage and real-
life stories.”

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances CMr Embley has said that the People, provides a unique focus on real-life stories. The title even 
publishes a supplementary magazine given over to such stories.222

5.3 

Despite the historic support of the Mirror Group for the Labour party, Mr Embley has shifted 
the political allegiance of the People. It is now politically independent. Mr Embley has told the 
Inquiry that this was a personal decision, linked to the wider re-launch of the title, following 
his promotion to the position of editor in May 2008.223 Mr Embley stressed the importance of 
the People’s independent position, and explained to the Inquiry that:224

“My move to political independence, I think, says quite a lot about where I stand on 
– my view is that I represent and my paper represents the views of its readers, and 
my view on why I moved it to be politically independent is because I think politics has 
changed so much and the parties are so closely aligned on so many policy issues that 
it seems wrong to me just to follow one party. I felt it enable me to stand up for my 
readers best.”

The Trinity Mirror titles are also campaigning newspapers, and routinely run campaigns on 
issues they understand to be of importance to the demographic of their readership.225 The 
People has campaigned on the issue of fuel poverty, working with the industry to provide 
free energy saving devices and raising awareness to rising energy costs.226 The Sunday Mirror 
have led a number of military campaigns, raising money for former servicemen, highlighting 
the need for improved aftercare offered to troops returning from service.227 Other campaigns 
have  included  the  Daily  Mirror’s  “Honour  the  Brave”  and  the  successful  “Pride  of  Britain 
Awards”.228 Mr Wallace told the Inquiry that the Daily Mirror campaigns very much reflect 
the title’s values and political stance, representing the interests of “ordinary people”.229

History
The  Daily  Mirror  was  founded  by  Alfred  Harmsworth,  Viscount  Northcliffe,  in  1903  as 
a periodical for ladies. The paper left the Harmsworth stable when it was sold in 1922 to 
Viscount Astor after Viscount Northcliffe’s death. During the 1930s, the Mirror developed 
a  strong  focus  on  working  class  issues.  By  1939  it  sold  1.4m  copies  a  day.  Its  popularity 
continued to grow and by the 1960s it was the most popular of the national dailies, selling 
over 6m copies a day. In June 1953 the Daily Mirror broke all records selling 7m copies on the 
day of the Coronation.

In 1963 the Mirror Group together with three magazine publishers formed the International 
Publishing Corporation (IPC).230 In 1960 the Mirror Group acquired the failing Daily Herald, 
and re-launched it in 1964 as a mid-market paper called The Sun, which was then sold to NI 
in 1969. In 1970 the IPC was taken over by Reed International Limited. In 1984, Pergamon

Holdings, a company owned by Robert Maxwell, acquired the Daily Mirror from Reed and it 
was re-listed as Mirror Group in 1991 following the death of Mr Maxwell that year. Trinity was 
formed in 1985 when the Liverpool Daily Echo separated from its holding company. Trinity 
grew  rapidly  through  the  acquisition  of  regional  titles  and  in  1999  Trinity  and  the  Mirror 
Group merged to form Trinity Mirror, the biggest newspaper publisher in the UK.231

Trinity Mirror is still one of the UK’s largest newspaper publishers with a portfolio including 
five national newspapers, over 130 regional newspapers and more than 500 digital products. 
In 2010 Trinity Mirror had revenue of £761.5m and operating profit of £123.3m.232 The Group 
employs  over  6,500  people  in  more  than  60  locations  across  the  UK,  including  nine  print 
sites. The Group has two trading divisions: Regionals and Nationals. The Nationals contribute 
something over half of Trinity Mirror’s revenues and profits, with revenue in 2010 of £430.3m 
and operating profits of £86.1m compared to 2010 revenue from the Regionals division of 
£331.2m, with an operating profit of £51.7m.

Trinity Mirror’s national titles include two daily titles: the Daily Mirror and the Daily Record; 
and three Sunday titles: the Sunday Mirror, the People and the Sunday Mail (the sister paper 
to the Daily Record). In February 2012 the Daily Mirror had a circulation of 1.102m,233 or just 
under 12% of national daily circulation. The Daily Record had a circulation of 291,825, which 
puts it at just over 3% of national circulation, meaning that the Mirror Group titles together 
account for around 15% of national circulation. The Sunday Mirror, the People and the Sunday 
Mail in February 2011 had circulations of 1,594,293, 701,246 and 376,898 respectively, with 
14.4%, 6.3% and 3.4% of national Sunday circulation respectively, with Mirror Group titles 
accounting for just over 24% of all national Sunday circulation, including the third and fifth 
most popular national Sunday titles.234

Governance structures
Trinity Mirror is a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Trinity Mirror boards

5.10  The  Board  consists  of  eight  members,  of  whom  the  Chair  and  four  members  are  non-
executives.  The  Executive  Directors  are  the  Chief  Executive,  the  Finance  Director  and  the 
Company Secretary.235 Risk management is handled through the Audit and Risk Committee 
and risk maps, with around 70 senior personnel required each year to certify that they are 
properly identifying and reporting risk.236 The Inquiry has been told that risks tracked by the 
Risk Committee include ‘catastrophic editorial error’.237 Day to day corporate governance is 
managed through the Executive Committee, which includes the three executive directors and 
the Managing Directors of the Nationals and Regionals Divisions.238

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C5.11  Within  the  Trinity  Mirror’s  overall  strategy  for  the  management  of  risk,  the  editor  is 
responsible for identifying risks and making the best judgments associated with that risk. In-
house lawyers are also in place at titles, and are responsible for providing advice to the editor 
in relation to publishing articles in compliance with the Code.239 The editor will report to the 
Managing Director (of either Nationals or Regionals), who in turn report to the Board, and 
the Chief Executive.240

Trinity Mirror editorial independence

5.12  The  editors  of  the  Daily  Mirror,  the  Sunday  Mirror  and  the  People  are  appointed  by  the 
Board of Trinity Mirror, which has the power to remove them.241 The final decision on what is 
published in a title belongs to the editor of that title, and is without influence from the Board 
or shareholders of Trinity Mirror.242

Trinity Mirror financial governance

5.13  Financial  authority  is  delegated  within  strict  limits,  dependent  on  seniority,  and  within 
budget categories.243 No one is authorised to approve payments that would breach any of 
Trinity Mirror’s policies. Trinity Mirror has a strict policy against all manifestations of fraud 
and dishonesty.244 The Fraud Policy states that Trinity Mirror will seek to recover all associated 
costs from the individual responsible for a fraud and makes clear that such action will lead 
to potential disciplinary processes, and might lead to the involvement of the police.245 Trinity 
Mirror policies makes clear that the system used for paying expenses should not be used for 
payment for editorial content, which is instead registered as a payment for contributions.246 
Expenses  must  be  approved  by  someone  other  than  the  claimant  with  an  appropriate 
authority level.247 If expenses relate to entertainment of a third party then only the editor can 
authorise the third party remaining anonymous on the record of the expenses.248

5.14  Each  title  has  a  budget  for  contributions,  and  MGN  has  68,000  contribution  accounts  of 
which 19,000 have had at least one transaction processed since 2005.249 Payments under the 
contributions system are made direct to the bank accounts of the recipients. All payments 
must be appropriately authorised and new accounts cannot be set up by the authoriser.250 
Cash payments can be made, but over a certain limit they must be approved by an editor or 
deputy editor and the approver must know to whom the payment is going. The request for 
the cash payment must be approved by a senior in-house legal advisor and the journalist 
must provide written receipts for the amounts claimed.251

PART C | The PressCTrinity Mirror policies and procedures

5.15  Trinity Mirror has a policy on Standards of Business Conduct with which all staff must comply.252 
There is also a Code of Conduct policy. Breach of either is grounds for disciplinary action.253 
The PCC Editors’ Code of Practice is incorporated into staff contracts.254 Trinity Mirror has a 
fraud policy and a whistle-blowers’ charter in place,255 which covers fraud and any instance 
of malpractice.256 Trinity Mirror also has a Dignity at Work Policy which covers bullying and 
victimisation, as well as an equal opportunities policy.257

5.16  The Mirror Group has used private investigators but since 2011 have introduced a new policy 
to halt such use.258 Trinity Mirror has also re-issued to staff the organisation’s policies and 
procedures on relevant privacy issues, including the zero tolerance policy on breaches to the 
Data Protection Act.259

Management structures and processes

5.17  The Chief Executive of the Trinity Mirror Group is responsible for the propriety and reputation 
of the company. The editorial functions of the national and regional titles are the responsibility 
of the editors of the individual titles. The management of editorial staff are for the editors 
alone.  However,  the  Board  has  the  power  to  appoint  and  terminate  the  contracts  of  the 
editors at all of the titles.260 Managing editors are responsible for the business operation of 
the newspapers and have no role in editorial issues.

5.18  The editor is ultimately responsible for the content of their publication and is granted full 
editorial  independence  by  the  Trinity  Mirror  Board.  The  editor  of  a  given  title  within  the 
Group  will  chair  editorial  conferences  with  heads  of  departments  on  a  daily  basis.261  262 
Journalists working on the Daily Mirror are expected to know and understand the Editors’ 
Code of Practice.263 Mr Wallace has told the Inquiry that in his view ethics was not something 
that should require frequent reminding in the newsroom as, he argued, it was inherently 
embedded in the culture of the Daily Mirror.264 To this extent, appropriate measures with 
regard  to  the  verification  of  sources  for  stories,  are  expected  to  be  the  responsibility  of

are in place.

Trinity Mirror incentives

5.19  Editors  at  Trinity  Mirror  do  not  receive  any  financial  benefit  for  printing  exclusive  stories. 
Trinity Mirror operates an annual bonus scheme which is linked to the financial performance 
of the company and an editor’s individual performance.266

Mirror Group Regionals

5.20  The Mirror Group regional titles also operate under the Mirror Group Standards of Business 
Conduct.267 In addition, there is a Mirror Group Regional Editorial Policy, which incorporates 
the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice.268  Approaches  may  differ  across  the  regional  portfolio.  The 
Inquiry has seen evidence from the Manchester Evening News (MEN), which was purchased 
from the Guardian Media Group in 2010, indicating that it requires every article to be looked 
at by two experienced journalists to ensure that it is lawful, accurate and fair.269 The MEN 
also seeks to ensure that nothing is published which is legally problematic, with a policy ‘if 
in doubt, don’t publish’.270 Any breach of the law or any use of subterfuge would have to be 
approved by the editor.271

6.  the telegraph Media group
6.1 

The  Daily  Telegraph  has  the  highest  daily  circulation  of  the  national  broadsheet  titles. 
The  Chairman  of  the  Telegraph  Media  Group,  Aidan  Barclay,  has  described  the  Telegraph 
as an ‘iconic’ company,272 which has successfully established itself as an “investigative and 
campaigning newspaper”.273 in this regard, Mr Barclay has said that the publication of the 
MPs’ expenses story in 2009 was:274

“…probably the most important piece of investigative journalism across the British 
press in the last two decades.”

6.2 

The current editor of the Daily Telegraph, Tony Gallagher, told the Inquiry of the quality of 
the professional culture that exists at the Daily Telegraph. He, like others, emphasised that

PART C | The PressC6.3 

The Daily Telegraph has historically supported the Conservative party. With this in mind, Mr 
Barclay also told the Inquiry that:276

“We  operate  under  an  overarching  principle  that  customers  come  first.  That  does 
not mean the papers do not criticise Conservative Governments and politicians: they 
regularly do.”

History
The Daily Telegraph was launched by Colonel Arthur B Sleigh in 1855, allegedly to air a personal 
grievance, but was soon sold to Joses Moses Levy. Levy’s son, Baron Burnham, eventually 
sold the Telegraph to Viscount Camrose in 1928 and both the Burnham and Camrose families 
remained  involved  in  the  management  of  the  newspaper  until  it  was  bought  by  Conrad 
Black in 1986 (Lord Black of Cross Harbour). Under Lord Black’s ownership, the Telegraph 
Group  became  part  of  Hollinger  International,  in  which  Lord  Black’s  Hollinger  Inc.  held  a 
73% controlling stake in the company. In 2004 Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay purchased 
Hollinger Inc, and with it the controlling stake in the Telegraph Group.

In February 2012, the Daily Telegraph had a circulation of 578,774, its nearest broadsheet 
competitor is The Times with a circulation of around 398,000. Even so, this amounts to only 
a small fraction (6.3%) of the UK’s national daily newspaper circulation. In the same month, 
The Sunday Telegraph, had a circulation of 461,280, which is the second most popular of the 
Sunday broadsheets (well behind the Sunday Times on 939,395), and accounts for 4.2% of UK 
Sunday newspaper circulation.277

Governance structures
The  Telegraph  Media  Group  is  a  private  company,  ultimately  controlled  by  Sir  David  and 
Sir Frederick Barclay’s Family Settlements.278 In 2010, it recorded a profit after taxation of 
£50m on a turnover of £324m.279 It currently employs over a thousand members of staff.280 
The Group publishes the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph and also operates the 
Telegraph website, www.telegraph.co.uk.

Telegraph boards

6.7 

The  Board  of  the  Telegraph  Media  Group  consists  of  eight  members:  the  Chief  Executive 
and  Finance  Director,  Howard  and  Aidan  Barclay,  three  Directors  of  other  Barclay  family 
undertakings, Rigel Mowatt, Philip Peters and Michael Seal and Loraine Twohill, who is an 
independent non-executive Director.281

6.9 

Telegraph editorial independence

The  commercial  and  editorial  sides  of  the  business  are  run  separately,  with  the  editors 
reporting directly to the Chief Executive.282 The editorial teams determine what appears in 
the publications at TMG, and decisions on editorial matters are left entirely to the editor, 
subject to operating within TMG budgetary constraints.283 Mr Gallagher, told the Inquiry that 
he speaks only once or twice a month to the Chairman of TMG and would otherwise be left 
to focus on editorial matters.284

Telegraph financial governance

The  Board  agrees  the  budget  for  the  newspaper,  and  authority  to  commit  expenditure  is 
delegated by the Board to department heads and senior editorial staff. Approved budgets for 
each editorial department are reviewed on a monthly basis.285 Any expenditure above the 
delegated level must be approved by the managing editor, Executive Director Editorial or the 
Finance Director.286 TMG has made clear to the Inquiry that it has systems in place to ensure 
that it acts in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.287

6.10  TMG also operates clear procurement policies which state that any procurement must fully 
reflect all applicable laws and requires that any actual or potential unethical or illegal practices 
by a supplier should be reported to the Finance Director and Commercial Legal Director.288 
Only five staff members at TMG are able to authorise payments to contributors of over £500 
or payments to suppliers of over £1,000.289 Cash advances are generally only permitted for 
foreign travel expenses.290

Telegraph policies and procedures

6.11  All  TMG  editorial  staff  are  required  under  the  terms  of  their  contracts  of  employment  to 
comply  with  the  terms  of  the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice.291  The  company’s  staff  handbook 
and  standard  employment  contracts  also  require  adherence  to  a  wider  set  of  standards, 
which include not bringing the company into disrepute.292 More recently, TMG have moved 
to  synthesise  their  core  principles  of  ethical  and  legal  conduct  into  an  Editorial  Code  of 
Conduct.293

PART C | The PressC6.12  TMG operates a whistle-blowing policy which allows staff to raise on an anonymous basis 
concerns they may have around potentially illegal or unlawful activity, or wrongdoing.294 TMG 
also introduced an Anti-Corruption and Bribery policy in 2010 following the introduction of 
the Bribery Act.295 At the time of writing, TMG did not have a policy on the employment of 
private investigators, but the company has made clear in evidence to the Inquiry that none 
have been employed within the tenure of the current editors.296

Telegraph management structures and processes

6.13  The Chief Executive Officer of the TMG, Murdoch MacLennan, is responsible for day to day 
leadership  of  the  company.  He  holds  weekly  senior  management  meetings  to  discuss  key 
strategic issues.297 Working to the editor of the Daily Telegraph are, the deputy editor, assistant 
editor and executive editor. Together they comprise the title’s senior editorial team. Beneath 
them sit the Department Heads (or editors). They are also supported by deputy editors.298

6.14  There are two legal departments at TMG. They have distinct responsibilities; the Corporate 
Legal Department and Editorial Legal Department.299 When issues arise they are addressed 
jointly by the editorial and relevant legal teams. Where a complaint is made about a failure to 
adhere to terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice, the Editorial Legal Department is responsible, 
together with the journalists involved and department head, for conducting an investigation 
and  responding  to  the  complaint  –  including  drafting  an  apology  where  appropriate.300 
Editorial Directives, for example requiring staff to bring specific types of issue to the legal 
department, are issued from time to time.301

6.15  Mr Gallagher told the Inquiry that the Daily Telegraph operates a system of peer-review for 
the majority of articles published on the Telegraph’s website. This has replaced the traditional 
process of editorial checks found in most newsrooms, for online news stories, as it relies on 
the judgment of more experienced reporters, who are effectively allowed to “self-publish their 
stories”.302 Mr Gallagher has noted, however, that this process is only applied to seemingly 
uncontroversial  news  stories,  whereas  any  article  which  might  attract  attention  would  be 
edited through the normal process, including, where appropriate with legal involvement.303

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances CTelegraph incentives

6.16  TMG  operates  an  annual  bonus  scheme  for  its  senior  commercial  executives  and  senior 
editorial  executives.  These  bonuses  are  not  contingent  on  publishing  particular  stories  or 
exclusives, but rather are determined by financial targets related to the operating profit of 
TMG and the individual titles.304

7.  the guardian Media group
7.1 

The Guardian is the only national broadsheet title that is owned by a Trust, rather than a 
traditional proprietor owner, or through shareholders in a public or private company. Dame 
Elizabeth Forgan is the Chair of the Scott Trust which owns the Guardian. She has said that the 
central objective of the Trust is:305

“To secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity: as 
a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to liberal 
tradition;  as  a  profit-seeking  enterprise  managed  in  an  efficient  and  cost-effective 
manner.”

7.2 

The  Guardian  is  required  by  the  Trust  to  support  ‘liberal  journalism’.  It  has  developed  a 
reputation  as  a  strongly  liberal  newspaper.  Although  this  might  be  considered  as  a  direct 
influence on the editorial decision-making at the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief 
of the title, explained to the Inquiry that:306

“…the  only  thing  the  Scott  Trust  tells  you  is  to  carry  on  the  paper  as  heretofore, 
and it’s left to you to interpret the traditions of the paper in the light of the current 
circumstances. I think it’s a liberal small “L”, …we discuss what the meaning of that is, 
but it’s not liberal politically.”

With this in mind, the Guardian has supported at different times the Labour Party, the Liberal 
Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party at general elections since 
1945.307

7.3 

History
The  Manchester  Guardian  (the  Guardian)  was  founded  in  1821  by  John  Edward  Taylor  to 
promote liberal interests in the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre. The journalist CP Scott 
was made editor of the Guardian in 1872 and remained in post until 1929. Scott bought the 
paper in 1907 and in 1936 the Scott Trust was established by the son of CP Scott and became 
the owner of the Guardian. The Trust Deed requires that the company must:

“... be carried on as nearly as may be upon the same principles as they have been 
heretofore conducted.”

The Trust was established as a limited company in 2008, with the core purpose of securing 
the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity.308 The Scott Trust is 
the owner of the Guardian Media Group. The Guardian Media Group has three wholly owned 
businesses: Guardian News & Media, GMG Radio and GMG Property services; and shares in 
Trader Media Group and Emap.

In 2010 GMG had a turnover of £280.2m excluding its joint ventures, but made an operating 
loss of £53.9million.309 Guardian News & Media publishes the Guardian and the Observer 
and guardian.co.uk. It also operates Guardian Business and Professional. GNM had turnover 
of £221m in 2010.310 In February 2010 The Guardian had circulation of 215,988, making it 
the second smallest circulation national broadsheet newspaper, with only 2.4% of UK daily 
national  circulation.  The  Observer,  in  February  2010,  had  circulation  of  253,022,  which  is 
again the second smallest of the Sunday broadsheets, accounting for 2.3% of national Sunday 
newspaper circulation.311

Governance structures
Guardian  News  and  Media  is  wholly  owned  by  GMG.  GMG  is  wholly  owned  by  the  Scott 
Trust, who appoints, and can remove, the editor of the Guardian.312 The Scott Trust is not 
only responsible for the appointment of the editor-in-chief but is also responsible for the 
appointment of the readers’ editor. Only the Trust has powers to rescind that appointment, 
and that is done by way of a vote of the Board of the Trust.313 This is to ensure the independence 
of the readers’ editor from senior operational staff at the Guardian and the editor-in-chief.

Guardian boards

The Board of the Scott Trust comprises ten directors. It includes the editor-in-chief of the 
Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, and the Chief Executive of GMG.314 Directors are appointed by a 
Nominations Committee (comprising the Chair and five Independent Directors). The directors 
meet quarterly and also meet annually with the full Board of GMG.315

The GMG Board consists of ten members, and includes the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, 
the Chief Executive of GMG and  the Company Secretary of GMG, with addition  the Chief 
Financial Officer of GMG and the Chief Executive of GMG Radio. The Board also comprises 
five Independent Directors.316 The Chair of the Scott Trust leads the appointment process for 
the Chair of GMG.317 The structure is deliberately designed to keep separate the editorial and

journalistic content.318

7.9 

The  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  GMG  is  ultimately  responsible  for  all  non-editorial  aspects 
of corporate governance. All board directors of GNM and GMG (with the exception of the 
editor-in-chief) are accountable to the Chief Executive.319

Guardian editorial independence

7.10  Editorial  governance  is  the  responsibility  of  the  editor-in  chief,  who  is  accountable  to  the 
board of the Scott Trust. The GMG Board is briefed on a monthly basis by the editor-in chief 
on editorial strategy and implementation, budgets, capital expenditure, industrial relations 
issues, significant stories and press coverage of the group. The editor-in chief also briefs the 
Scott Trust on similar issues on a quarterly basis. Both Boards reviews past performance and 
strategy for the year ahead in November.320 Directors do not discuss the editorial or political 
line of the paper.321

Guardian financial governance

7.11  The Group Audit Committee assists the GMG board in its oversight, including the integrity 
of financial reporting procedures and the company’s compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements.322 GNM has policies on expenses, delegated authority thresholds, bribery and 
anti-corruption, corporate hospitality and gifts and travel and expenses.323 These policies are 
available to staff through the company intranet and are kept under review to ensure that they 
are up to date.324

7.12  Payments to freelance journalists are processed by administrators using a bespoke payments 
system.  Any  one-off  payments  are  made  through  the  Finance  Department.  Payments  to 
regular suppliers are made through a procurement system which requires a unique purchase 
order number for that payment to be made.325 Staff are able claim expenses in accordance 
with  the  company’s  expenses  policy.  Expenses  are  approved  by  officials  within  delegated 
approval limits.326 If a claim exceeds the limits set by the relevant policies, claims are referred 
to the managing editor for further scrutiny.327

PART C | The PressCGuardian policies and procedures

7.13  The Guardian operates its own editorial code of conduct which has been in place since 2002.328 
This incorporates the Editors’ Code of Practice, which Guardian staff are required to comply 
with in the terms of their employment contracts.329 The GNM Code includes a number of 
issues not covered by the Editors’ Code of Practice (e.g. conflicts of interest and declarations) 
and also offers more comprehensive guidance than the Editors’ Code of Practice on a number 
of matters including privacy. In addition, the GNM Code also sets out a series of questions, 
including engaging the “the Omand Principles”, which should be considered by journalists 
whenever privacy issues are potentially engaged. These are:330

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

There must be sufficient cause – the intrusion needs to be justified by the scale of 
the harm that might result from it;
There must be integrity of motive – the intrusion must be justified in terms of the 
public good that would follow from publication;
the methods used must be in proportion to the seriousness of the story and its 
public interest, using the minimum possible intrusion;
there must be proper authority – any intrusion must be authorised at a sufficiently 
senior level and with appropriate oversight;
there  must  be  a  reasonable  prospect  of  success’  fishing  expeditions  are  not 
justified.

7.14  The Guardian also operates a whistle blowing policy, and encourages its use by reassuring 
staff  that  they  should  be  able  to  raise  issues  without  fear  of  “accusations  of  disloyalty, 
harassment or victimisation”.331 An Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy was introduced in June 
2011, which was designed by the GMG and GNM’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Committee. 
This Committee reports on a regular basis to the GMG Board.332

Guardian management structures and processes

7.15  As previously stated, the editor-in-chief is responsible to the Scott Trust in terms of all editorial 
matters. In this regard, he reports directly to the Trust, rather than GMG’s Chief Executive 
Officer. However, the editor-in-chief (who is also a director of both GMG and GNM) also has 
a responsibility to keep the GMG board informed about his areas of business, including the 
business  of  both  the  Guardian  and  the  Observer.333  The  remainder  of  the  board  directors 
of GNM and GMG are accountable to the CEO. He in turn reports to the Chair of GMG and 
directors of the Trust.334 335

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C7.16  On an editorial level, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian and the editor of the Observer are 
responsible for their respective titles. They hold meetings to discuss issues affecting both 
titles, including budgets, staff issues and general strategy.336 The editorial process is the same 
for both the print and digital edition of the Guardian.337

7.17  Parallel  to  such  processes,  the  Director  of  Editorial  Legal  Services,  Gillian  Phillips,  reports 
directly  to  the  managing  editor  of  GNM,  with  whom  meetings  are  held  on  a  fortnightly 
basis. The Director of Editorial Legal Services is responsible for briefing the GNM Executive 
Committee on a monthly basis. These briefings will cover the main legal issues which have 
arisen, and the status of any complaints, or other on-going matters which the Committee 
should be made aware of.338

Guardian readers’ editors

7.18  Both the Guardian and the Observer have readers’ editors. The Guardian’s readers’ editor, 
Chris Elliott, is, as noted, independently appointed by the Scott Trust, and is accountable only 
to the Chair of the Trust.339 The readers’ editor at the Observer is not appointed in this way, 
but through the editor and with “an unwritten guarantee of independence”.340 This position is 
currently held by Stephen Pritchard, who is also member of the Board and former President 
of the Organisation of News Ombudsman.341 The contact details of the readers’ editor of both 
titles are published in each edition of the respective newspaper.

7.19  As noted above, the Guardian is one of very few newspapers to employ a readers’ editor. The 
role of the readers’ editor is to correct or clarify inaccuracies, discuss issues raised by readers 
and liaise with an external Ombudsman.342 The readers’ editor at the Guardian writes a weekly 
column on the issues raised by readers. Reflecting the corporate and editorial independence 
of the role, this cannot be amended by the newspaper’s editor.

7.20  On occasion, when the editor might disagree with the judgment of the readers’ editor, the 
views of the former may be taken into account, but ultimately the editor has no power to 
change the outcome of the readers’ editor’s findings. To this extent, Mr Elliott has stressed 
to the Inquiry that:343

“...obviously you listen carefully to that [view of the Editor], but if, in the end, you 
think it’s the right thing to do, you can fall back on the fact that you are employed by 
the Trust -- I’m employed by the Trust and I actually think they’re wrong and we go 
ahead and I do what I see fit.”

However,  there  is  a  consultation  process  with  the  editor,  the  managing  editor  and  the

7.21  The readers’ editor may also refer any substantial grievances to the external Ombudsman. 
This  is  an  externally  appointed  reviewer,  who  considers  any  complaints  which  bring  into 
question  the  integrity  of  a  Guardian  journalist.344  The  Ombudsman’s  role  is  to  review  the 
process of review conducted by the Readers’ Editor in carrying out the initial investigation. 
The Ombudsman does not look at or reinvestigate the complaint itself:345

“…he will look at the processes, the way we’ve actually carried out, rather than try to 
reinvestigate it. What he’s trying to assess is whether the readers’ editor has done it 
fairly and competently.”

7.22 

In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Elliott explained that the external Ombudsman is unlikely to 
deal with a large number of referrals in the space of a year, only “maybe one or two a year.”346

8.  the independent group
8.1 

The Independent is the youngest of the major national daily newspapers. Independent Print 
Limited  is  jointly  owned  by  the  Russian  business  tycoon,  Alexander  Lebedev  and  his  son, 
Evgeny. The Evening Standard Limited is also owned by the Lebedevs, having been purchased 
in January 2009. Evgeny Lebedev told the Inquiry that his focus for both newspaper titles is 
the provision of accurately informed journalism, which is ethically sound and delivered in the 
public interest. He said that although his papers might adopt different approaches and have 
different political leanings, the broader purpose of both titles remains dedicated to fair and 
accurate journalism.347

8.2  Mr Lebedev has expressed his pride at the successes of the London Evening Standard, a free 
newspaper title, which has reach of over one million readers a day in London, reporting on 
issues affecting the people of the capital.348 With regard to the philosophy of The Independent, 
Mr Lebedev has said that the title is:349

“…famed for its brilliant journalism,  its foreign reporting, its comment, its -- it’s a 
newspaper that people trust because traditionally it’s been independent.”

8.3 

The  current  editor  of  The  Independent,  Christopher  Blackhurst,  echoed  Mr  Lebedev’s 
evidence with regard to the reputation of The Independent. Mr Blackhurst told the Inquiry 
that the Independent prides itself on taking the highest ethical stance. He said that this ethical 
journalism is the core of The Independent brand, which Mr Blackhurst described as a “serious 
newspaper at the top end of the market”. 350 He has said further that this commitment to high 
quality journalism is reflected in the content published by the newspaper.

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C8.4 

The Independent did not adopt a party political position at the two general elections that 
followed its launch but supported Labour at the 1997 electon. In subsequent elections it has 
switched its support between the Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties.

8.6 

History
The Independent was founded in 1986 by the journalists Andreas Whittam Smith, Stephen 
Glover and Brett Straub, and was published by Newspaper Publishing plc. The creation of the 
new paper took place against the background of the Wapping disputes. It launched with the 
advertising slogan, “It is. Are you?” making play of the independence of the newspaper from 
the influence of a powerful proprietor.

Although The Independent enjoyed initial success, and had achieved a circulation in excess of 
400,000 by 1989, by the early 1990s its readership had declined and the paper was struggling 
financially.  In  1994  both  Independent  News  &  Media  (INM),  a  prominent  Irish  publishing 
company, and Mirror Group Newspapers took a stake in Newspaper Publishing and in 1996 
INM purchased the whole company. By 1998 circulation had fallen to below 200,000, the 
smallest circulation of any of the national daily newspapers by some margin. By 2004, The 
Independent was reporting losses of £5m per year, and in 1998, following staff cuts, and in 
order to make further cost savings, the title moved to Northcliffe House, the headquarters of 
Associated Newspapers, where the two groups shared a number of services (though editorial, 
management and commercial operations remained separate).

8.7 

In  January  2009  a  company  set  up  by  the  Lebedevs,  purchased  the  loss  making  Evening 
Standard  from  Associated  News  for  £1.  The  DMGT  retain  a  24.9%  share  of  the  Evening 
Standard.351 In March 2010, it was announced that the Lebedevs’ company would be buying 
The Independent. Alexander Lebedev was quoted as saying:352

“I invest in institutions which contribute to democracy and transparency and, at the 
heart of that, are newspapers which report independently and campaign for the truth 
to be revealed. I am a supporter of in-depth investigative reporting and campaigns 
which promote transparency and seek to fight international corruption. These are 
things the Independent has always done well and will, I hope, continue to do.”

8.8 

8.9 

A separate newspaper, the ‘i’ was launched in October 2010, aimed at ‘readers and lapsed 
readers’ of all ages and commuters with limited time. Priced at 20p it has quickly overtaken 
The Independent in circulation.

In February 2012, the circulation of The Independent stood at 105,160. Its sister paper ‘i’ 
has more than twice the circulation, at 264,432. Altogether the two titles account for 4% 
of UK national daily newspaper circulation. The Independent on Sunday had a circulation in 
February 2012 of 124,260, or 1.1% of UK national Sunday newspaper circulation.

PART C | The PressCGovernance structures
Independent Print Limited (IPL), wholly owned by the Lebedev Family, is a private company. 
The company is legally distinct from the Lebedev owned Evening Standard Limited,353

8.10 

The Independent board

8.11  The Board of IPL consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairman, the CEO of IPL and of Non Executive 

Directors. The Board is also attended by the Company Secretary and Finance Director.354

8.12  The IPL Board also exercises a number of financial functions, which are reviewed on a weekly 
basis, to monitor the budgeting within the company. Editorial staff, for example, are allocated 
set budgets and these are monitored on a weekly basis and scrutinised in more depth by 
the  Board  on  a  monthly  basis.355  The  Finance  Director  and  Company  Secretary  of  IPL  has 
emphasized  the  importance  of  transparency  of  editorial  payments  to  the  Board’s  overall 
corporate and financial governance functions.356

8.13  The managing editor of IPL and Evening Standard Limited is responsible for the IPL’s company 
strategy.357 This document is endorsed by the IPL Board, and is used to monitor the progress 
of IPL on a monthly basis through Board meetings.358

The Independent editorial independence

8.14  There is complete editorial independence from the Board.359 The governance of the Board 
is  concerned  primarily  with  the  financial  management  of  the  business.  managing  editor, 
Andrew Mullins explains that:360

“…we separate commercial and editorial to create clear editorial independence.”

8.15  However, there are instances where editorial issues might be raised at Board level and Mr 
Blackhurst  has  also  told  the  Inquiry  that  as  the  editor  he  is  fully  aware  of  the  company’s 
overall business strategy. 361 Mr Mullins explained that there are occasionally scenarios where 
costs related to the editorial structure are impacted; or where sales would significantly fall. 
Mr  Mullins  explained  that  in  these  instances,  discussion  of  editorial  processes  would  be

editorial content.362

8.16  Mr  Blackhurst  also  told  the  Inquiry  that  The  Independent  has  always  sought  to  adopt  a 
deliberately distinct approach to other national titles and continues to operate “free from 
proprietorial  influence”.363  In  his  evidence  to  the  Inquiry,  Mr  Lebedev  emphasised  that 
although he might on occasion share his expectations and personal vision with his editors 
on  a  regular  basis,  he  has  no  influence  on  the  editorial  content  of  his  newspapers.364  He 
explained to the Inquiry that:365

“…we  certainly  discuss  policies,  and  I  certainly  expect  it  to  be  taken  into  account, 
but to answer your question, there have been many instances when we’ve discussed 
particular  issues,  stories,  policies  and  editors  would  have  stuck  with  their  original 
plan to write whatever they were planning to write.”

The Independent financial governance

8.17  The Independent has in place clear procedures that govern all financial transactions made 
by staff at the company.366 Manish Malhotra, the IPL’s current Finance Director and Company 
Secretary of Evening Standard Limited told the Inquiry that these procedures reflect the:367

“…separation between editorial and commercial… …for that reason it’s very important 
that  editorial  payments  are  going  through  the  overall  corporate  and  financial 
governance of the company so that we have clear sight of what’s being paid and 
who’s being paid.”

8.18  Under this system, payments to casual staff are authorised by the relevant Department Head 
and have to be approved by the Financial Controller or the Senior Management Accountant.368 
Contributions payments (made to freelancers, photographs etc) are made on the payments 
system  and  checked  by  the  Finance  Department  with  levels  of  authorisation  required 
dependent  on  the  amount  concerned.  The  Financial  Controller  and  Senior  Management 
Accountant authorise such payments. Expenses have to be authorised by department heads, 
and  editorial  expenses  must  be  authorised  by  the  Managing  Editor.  These  payments  are 
then authorised by the Finance Department in a similar way to contributions payments. No 
advances are made for UK based expenses.369

PART C | The PressC8.19  Mr Malhotra told the Inquiry that there are no mechanisms in place which allow for journalists 
or other IPL members of staff to make cash payments.370 Internal controls are overseen by the 
office of the managing editor, who ensures that any payments which are made are:371

“…proper, are substantiated and, if  appropriate, that there is  a receipt to support 
them.”

The Independent policies and procedures

8.20 

IPL  has  recently  introduced  a  Code  of  Conduct  which  brings  together  a  number  of  policy 
matters in one document. Mr Blackhurst told the Inquiry that it would have been unlikely for 
The Independent to have introduced this revised Code, were it not for the exposure of phone 
hacking  and  other  practices  across  the  British  National  press.  The  purpose  of  the  revised 
Code is to ensure clarity on a range of issues facing journalists.372 The IPL’s Finance Director 
and Company Secretary has explained that the document goes further than the PCC Code, 
that:373

“…it’s a wider document because it covers both commercial and editorial operations. 
It also goes into the use of hospitality and guidance and policies around that.”

8.21  The creation of the Code was triggered by the enactment of the Bribery Act. However, as 
well  as  covering  anti-bribery  it  also  covers  business  relationships,  social  media  and  data 
protection.374 IPL has also restated its insistence on staff compliance with the Editors’ Code 
of Practice.375 IPL’s Code of Conduct details individual financial responsibility within IPL, and 
the policies on company expenses and hospitability.376 The IPL Code of Conduct also includes 
a policy on whistle-blowing, which encourages employees to report concerns without fear of 
reprisal.377

8.22 

IPL also has a clear disciplinary policy which sets out that employees who are found to have 
committed acts of gross misconduct are liable for dismissal. Acts of gross misconduct includes 
‘theft, dishonesty or deliberate falsification of documents’, ‘unauthorised use or disclosure 
of  confidential  information’  and  ‘a  serious  act  which  breaks  mutual  trust  and  confidence 
or which brings or is likely to bring IPL into disrepute’.378 This policy was explained to the 
Inquiry by Mr Blackhurst in the context of the disciplinary action that has been taken against 
Johann Hari, a former journalist at The Independent. Mr Hari was accused of plagiarism and 
producing derogatory comments about fellow journalists on the Wikipedia website.

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C8.23  Staff and external contributors are required by contract379 to comply with both the law and 

with the PCC Code.380 Freelance contracts require that:381

“Anyone  who  supplies  material  to  any  of  our  publications  must  ensure  that  their 
conduct and the material they submit are ethical, legal and proper.”

8.24  Other than these guidelines, there are no specific policies in place in relation to the payment 
for information. Mr Blackhurst has acknowledged that payments are sometimes made for 
‘tip-offs’ for stories carried in The Independent’s diary page but Mr Blackhurst also stated 
that  he  exercises  considerable  caution  with  information  received  in  this  way.  He  told  the 
Inquiry that the Independent would:382

“…only pay, as a point of principle, if subsequently the story checked out. You wouldn’t 
be agreeing and paying… That’s not how it works.”

The Independent management structures and processes

8.25  Mr Blackhurst described The Independent as a relatively small newsroom. The group employs 
just under 200 journalists across the three titles (the daily, Sunday, and ‘i’ publication) and a 
small number of foreign correspondents.383

8.26  Letters to the editor are handled between the editor and the managing editor, in the absence 
of a readers’ editor. Mr Blackhurst said that The Independent does not have enough resources 
to merit the appointment of a readers’ editor at the title.384

8.27  The editor is responsible for overseeing processes around the verification of sources in the 
newsroom. Checks are made by the original reporter, the news editor, the deputy editor and 
finally the editor, having been through legal scrutiny. Mr Blackhurst told the Inquiry that:385

“I’m with the news editor, the foreign editor, the deputy editor pretty much all day 
long,  and  they’re  around  me,  and  it’s  not  a  case  of  formal  up  and  down  the  line 
requests. If I want to ask a reporter: “Where’s the story come from?” I’ll ask them. I 
won’t wait for the deputy editor to speak to the news editor to speak to the reporter. 
We haven’t got all day. I mean, just get on with it.”

8.28  Freelance writers are generally dealt with by the Heads of Department and very rarely deal 

directly with a newsroom editor, unless the freelancer is working on a substantive story.386

9.1 

The Financial Times focuses on the detailed and impartial reporting of business and financial 
issues.  Lionel  Barber,  current  editor  of  the  Financial  Times,  told  the  Inquiry  that  as  a 
consequence of this focus, that paper avoids the more populist news items which might be 
given space in other parts of the UK press.

History
The Financial Times (FT) was first published in 1888. In 1945 it merged with the Financial 
News. The FT was acquired by Pearson Plc in 1957 and is now a global newspaper, printed 
in 18 locations, in three international editions and with estimated global readership of 1.4m 
across more than 100 countries.387 Pearson is primarily an education publishing company, 
with publications of educational material accounting for 74% of its revenue. 19% of Pearson 
revenue is derived from its consumer book publishing arm, with the remaining 7% coming 
from the FT Group which provides business information both through publication of the FT 
and digital services.

The FT Group, including both FT print and digital services had sales in 2010 of £403m, with 
operating profit the same year of £60m. Digital revenues accounted for 40% of FT Group 
revenues. The FT Group employs 2,600 people, of whom 1,600 are based in the UK.388 In 
February  2012  the  FT  had  a  UK  circulation  of  316,493,  making  it  the  third  largest  selling 
broadsheet newspaper in the UK after the Daily Telegraph and The Times, giving the FT some 
3.5% of the UK national daily newspaper market.389

Governance structures
FTL is wholly owned by Pearson Group and as such both the Chief Executive and the editor 
report to the Chief Executive of Pearson Group. Pearson is a public company and has dual 
listing on the US and UK stock exchanges.390 The editor of the Financial Times is appointed 
by the Chief Executive of Pearson Group, who is also the only person who can remove him 
or her. On financial matters the editor reports to the Chief Executive of the FT. The editor of 
the FT, Mr Barber,391 has made it clear in evidence to the Inquiry that there is no editorial 
involvement by Pearson. The Chief Executive of the FT has said that reporting to Pearson 
provides ‘a further layer of governance’,392 but no additional information has been provided 
on how that relationship works in practice.

The  FT  ‘family’  consists  of  a  number  of  different  news  services.  The  FT  itself  and  FT.com, 
where relevant, has according to the FT’s own figures,393 a combined paid print and digital 
circulation  of  591,390. This  is  made  up  of  the  FT  newspaper’s  daily  (global)  circulation  of 
344,583 noted above394 and the 247,000 paying FT digital subscribers. The FT has said that it 
has a combined print and online average daily readership of 2.1m people worldwide. FT.com 
has over 4m registered users.

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances CFinancial Times boards

9.6 

The FT Board of Directors comprises the editor and Chief Executive of the FT and the managing 
editors of other parts of the FT family as well as senior Directors with responsibility for finance, 
HR and communications. There are no independent Directors on the Board.395 The Board is 
not expected to have knowledge of the sources of stories that appear in FT publications.396

Financial Times financial governance

9.7 

The FT group is profitable and has shown growth in profits over the period 2005-2010.

Financial Times policies and procedures

9.8 

9.9 

Pearson  PLC  publishes  a  Code  of  Conduct  which  requires  all  Pearson  employees  (and 
therefore all FT employees) to conduct themselves in accordance with the law and with the 
ethical principles set out in that Code.397 All Pearson employees are reminded of the Code on 
an annual basis and required to confirm compliance or identify cases of non-compliance.398 
Pearson employees can report breaches of the Code to their manager or in-house legal team.

The FT incorporates the Editors’ Code of Practice into employee contracts and has further, 
additional requirements in relation to financial reporting and share ownership.399 FT employees 
are asked by management to sign up to the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice and are 
asked to declare any financial interests in a share register. Evidence has been submitted that 
demonstrates 75% of FT employees had done so.400 It is the intention of the FT to require all 
employees to sign up to compliance with the Editors’ Code on an annual basis.401 The Inquiry 
was told that management are not aware of any breaches of the Editors’ Code of Practice at 
the FT.402

9.10  Mr Barber said that journalists at the FT are expected to go beyond what is required in the 
PCC Code and uphold the highest levels of ethical journalism at his title. To this effect he told 
the Inquiry that:403

“…the reason we set such a high bar is that our relationship with our readers -- and 
they  are  largely  in  business  and  finance,  but  not  exclusively,  and  diplomacy  and 
academia  –  is  one  of  trust.  People  have  to  be  able  to  rely  on  the  Financial  Times 
for accurate information which is set in context, multiple sourced and that they can 
rely on it because they’re making decisions, important decisions in their respective 
professions.”

PART C | The PressC9.11  The news editor is responsible for ensuring that the relevant editorial checks are made in the 
FT newsroom. Mr Barber has described the position of the news editor at the FT as one the 
most “critical appointments that I can make as editor”.404

9.12  Pearson also operates a whistle-blowing hotline called ‘Ethicspoint’ which allows employees 
to report breaches of the Pearson code on an anonymous basis.405 However, Mr Barber told 
the Inquiry that the FT does not offer a similar whistle blowing hotline for breaches of the 
Editors’ Code of Practice. Of course, employees are entitled to use the Pearson hotline to 
raise any concerns they might have, but Mr Barber said that he would expect any issues in 
relation to such breaches to be brought to the attention of senior management directly.406 Mr 
Barber spoke about a “good culture” at the FT and said that he would expect problems to be 
shared at all levels. He also told the Inquiry that the managing editor operates an open-door 
policy for staff who may wish to raise any HR issues, and works together with the Financial 
Times union, to whom individuals can also bring grievances.407

9.13 

In this regard Mr Barber told the Inquiry that:408

“I think the FT should be the gold standard in journalism, and that means that we 
need to uphold the highest practices, the highest standards of integrity, and that is 
why we have the Investment Register and why we want to have full compliance from 
our journalists.”

9.14  The FT also has in place an anti Bribery and Corruption policy, introduced after the Bribery 
Act 2010.409 Where an employee might have a concern relating to bribery or corruption at 
the FT, they are required to raise it with their immediate manager or with the in-house legal 
or internal audit teams, or to use Ethicspoint to report their concerns, should they wish to do 
so anonymously.

9.15  The FT has policies in place regarding approval of payments to third parties and payment of 
expenses to employees.410 In both cases expenditure within agreed budgets and spending 
limits are approved by the individual incurring the expenditure and on the basis of appropriate 
evidence  of  the  expenditure.  Generally  two  individuals  will  review  any  expenses  claim.411 
These processes are checked regularly to ensure compliance.412 The FT states that it does 
not pay sources for stories, though sometimes reasonable expenses, such as travel, may be 
reimbursed, though no specific incidences are recalled.413

9.16  Whilst the editorial management team is responsible for ensuring editorial staff adhere to 
the PCC Code of Practice, other policies such as the company’s anti-bribery policy are the 
responsibility of the Company Secretariat team.414

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances CFinancial Times management structures and processes

9.17  The FT Management Board are responsible for the corporate and financial governance of the 
FT. Its operation is entirely separate from all editorial responsibilities which lie with the editor. 
The FT’s finance team is responsible for overseeing the processes of expenses and invoice 
payments.415

9.18 

It  is  the  role  of  the  managing  editor  to  ensure  the  management  of  the  editorial  budget, 
staff  management  and  the  general  departmental  administration  of  the  newsroom.416  The 
managing editor is also responsible  for administering the Investment Register, an internal 
procedure which ensures that the investment interests of editorial staff are appropriately 
disclosed.417

Financial Times incentives

9.19  Financial incentives for the Chief Executive are linked to circulation and profitability of the 
group.418 There are no financial incentives for the editor related to the production of exclusive 
stories.419

10.  the regional press
10.1  There  are  1,167  regional  and  local  newspapers  operating  in  the  UK  today,  including  105 
dailies, 15 Sundays, 504 paid weeklies, 533 free weeklies and ten combined weekly titles.420 
As of 1 January 2012 there were 87 regional press publishers, including 40 publishers who 
produce just one title each.421 The top 20 publishers account for 86% of all regional press titles 
and 97% of total weekly circulation.422 Table 5.1 (below) sets out the twenty most significant 
regional newspaper groups measured both by weekly circulation and by the number of titles 
published.

10.2  Regional newspapers in the UK are read by 32.9 million people (70.7% of all British adults), 
compared with the 56.8% who read a national newspaper. Significantly, 27% of those who read 
a regional newspaper do not read a national newspaper.423 In addition to the regional print 
titles there are also over 1,600 websites and hundreds of other print, digital and broadcast 
channels produced by local and regional media groups.424

10.3  The regional and local newspaper industry also has a significant economic footprint. Over 
30,000 people, including 10,000 journalists, are employed by the regional and local press.425 
The  four  largest  regional  newspaper  groups  had  revenues  in  2010  of  £1,330m,  with  total 
sales and advertising revenue across the industry of £2,191m.426 However, the regional and 
local newspapers market has been in significant decline for a number of years. Some regional

PART C | The PressCnewspapers have seen their circulations halve since 2000 and others have been forced to 
close entirely. Annual regional newspaper circulation has fallen from just under 3.5bn in 1985 
to below 2bn in 2009.427 The factors considered to contribute to this decline in circulation 
include:  increasing  access  to,  and  adoption  of,  internet  information  sources:  economic 
conditions; and lack of engagement with print media by young adults.428

10.4  The decline in circulation has been matched by a decline in revenue. Print newspapers have 
two main sources of income – copy sales and advertising. Advertising is predominantly in 
two  different  forms,  display  advertising  and  classified  advertising.  The  local  and  regional 
press tend to rely much more heavily on classified advertising than do the nationals, with 
classified advertising accounting for 41% of revenues among the regional press but only 6.5% 
of revenues in the national press.429 All three forms of revenue have been under significant 
pressure over recent years.

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C10.5  Overall advertising revenues in the regional press have fallen steeply, from a high of £3,133m 
in  2004  to  £1,599m  in  2010.  This  is  a  much  steeper  decline  in  advertising  revenues  than 
has been seen in the national press or in consumer magazines.431 The decline in advertising 
revenue has been largely driven by competition from the internet. Classified advertising, in 
particular, has moved online, with the share of classified advertising online rising from 4% 
in 2002 to over 60% in 2010, and the printed press’ share falling commensurately from 96% 
to under 40% in the same timeframe. That trend is predicted to continue, with the internet 
accounting  for  over  80%  of  classified  advertising  by  2015.432  Display  advertising  has  also 
moved online, but the trend is not as marked as is the case with classified advertising.433

10.6  The net result of these changes is that revenues in regional and local newspaper publishing 
have been very hard hit. Trinity Mirror’s regional division saw revenues fall by 47% between 
2005 and 2010, while Newquest has seen revenues fall by 56% over the same timeframe and 
Northcliffe has seen its revenues fall by 50%. Johnston Press appears to have suffered less 
over the period, with revenues falling only by 23%, but it is clear that conditions for regional 
and local newsgroups are very difficult.

10.7  Despite this bleak picture, regional news provision remains essentially profitable, with the 
three of the top four regional newspaper groups for which figures are available posting profits 
of £154m between them in 2010.434 Sly Bailey, then Chief Executive of Trinity Mirror, told the 
Inquiry that, in between her submission of written evidence to the Inquiry on 13 October 
2011,  and  her  appearance  at  the  Inquiry  on  16  January  2012,  the  company  had  reduced 
the number of regional titles it publishes from 160 to 140.435 Ms Bailey indicated that Trinity 
Mirror’s regional business was facing structural challenges, with the competition from the 
internet and the proliferation of new connected devices, as well as cyclical challenges from 
the state of the economy. She said that the cyclical challenges had hit the hardest.436 The 
effect of the economic downturn has meant, for instance that whereas at its peak Trinity 
Mirror had seen £150m in revenue from recruitment advertising, this figure had reduced to 
£20m last year.437 Ms Bailey said that Trinity Mirror’s response to the current situation was to 
restructure and re-engineer the industry using technology, rather than trying to do the same 
things with fewer people.438

10.8  This picture was echoed by editors of regional newspaper in their evidence to the Inquiry.439 
Maria McGeoghan, editor of the Trinity Mirror Regional title, the Manchester Evening News, 
told the Inquiry that:440

“…circulation  on  the  Manchester  Evening  News  and  the  paid  for  weekly  titles 
is  declining,  but  our  website  has  got  1.5  million  unique  users  every  month  and  is 
growing, and I think the challenge for all of us is how we can make more money out 
of that.”

PART C | The PressC10.9  Over recent years the regional and national press has been concerned about, and lobbied on, 
a number of public policy issues that impact on them. These have included: changes in the 
rules governing statutory notices; local authorities publishing their own free newssheets, in 
particular where they are partially advertising funded; and the media merger rules as they 
apply to the transfer of ownership of newspaper at the regional and local level.441 This last 
issue is considered to be the most significant and was raised by Mr Bailey in her evidence to 
the Inquiry.442

10.10  The exigencies of the economic and structural problems faced by the regional newspaper 
industry  have  led  to  a  substantial  extent  to  groups  looking  to  consolidate  and  rationalise 
their holdings. Savings can be achieved where titles that are geographically close can achieve 
synergies through working together. This has led to regional newspaper groups looking to 
consolidate  their  holdings,  in  particular  with  an  eye  to  geographical  rationalisation.  The 
regional  newspaper  industry  has  been  concerned  that  the  Office  of  Fair  Trading  (OFT)  is 
inclined to consider proposals for newspaper mergers in the context of the local newspaper 
market only, rather than taking account of the wider competition from, in particular, internet 
services. This, the industry argues, leads to potential regional newspaper transfers that could 
allow titles that would otherwise be uneconomic and may have to close to survive under 
different ownership. In 2009 the OFT conducted a review of the media merger regime as it 
applies to local and regional newspapers, and concluded that:443

“…the current merger regime, which is broadly the same for newspapers as for other 
industries, is well placed to take into account developments such as competition from 
the internet because it is evidence-based and capable of reflecting market realities.
The regime is also flexible in that it can take account of valid ‘failing firm’ arguments, 
as well as efficiencies and any other benefits to customers brought about through a 
merger.
The OFT has therefore recommended that no legislative changes are needed to the 
media merger regime. The OFT proposes that it will formally seek Ofcom’s view in 
future newspaper merger cases, given its specific sector knowledge in the UK.”

10.11  The first proposed regional newspaper transaction since this new process involving Ofcom 
was introduced was the proposal of the Kent Messenger Group to acquire seven local weekly 
titles  from  Northcliffe  Media  Limited.  Ofcom  conducted  a  Local  Media  Assessment  which 
found that the ‘merger may provide the opportunity to rationalise costs, maintain quality 
and investment, and provide a sounder commercial base from which to address long-term 
structural change’. The OFT noted that it was able only to consider consumer benefits and 
that  Ofcom  was  not  able  to  guarantee  that  in  the  longer  term  any  benefits  arising  from 
the transaction would accrue to consumers rather than to shareholders. In the light of this 
the OFT said that it could not conclude that the evidence presented to it was sufficiently 
compelling to indicate that those benefits can and will only be achieved through the merger. 
The OFT also said that they had not been shown any compelling evidence that in the absence 
of  the  transaction  the  titles  would  all  continue  to  exist  as  economic  going  concerns.  The 
OFT  therefore  concluded  on  18  October  2011  that  the  merger  should  be  referred  to  the 
Competition Commission.444 Within a month of the OFT decision Northcliffe had announced 
the closure of two of the titles concerned, the Medway News and the East Kent Gazette.445

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C10.12  In relation to regional and local newspapers, I do not make a specific recommendation but I 
suggest that the Government should look urgently as what action it might be able take to help 
safeguard the ongoing viability of this much valued and important part of the British press. It 
is clear to me that local, high-quality and trusted newspapers are good for our communities, 
our identity and our democracy and play an important social role. However, this issue has not 
been covered in any detail by the Inquiry and, although the extent and nature of the problem 
has been made clear, the Inquiry has heard no evidence as to how it might be addressed. I 
recognise that there is no simple solution to this issue. I also recognise that many efforts have 
been made over the years to try to find a solution, and that many of the options for public 
support that have been canvassed are not appropriate. This does not make the need to find 
a solution any less urgent. I should also, perhaps, make it clear that the regulatory model 
proposed later in this Report should not provide an added burden to the regional and local 
press.

11.  Magazines and periodicals
11.1  The UK magazine market is substantial. There are some 3,000 consumer titles in the UK (this 
is separate from the 4,765 business  to business  magazines).  The magazine industry has a 
value of £4.1bn, with an estimated 1.4bn copies sold or distributed annually, and consumers 
spending  some  £1.9bn  a  year  buying  magazines.446  ABC  monitors  some  515  consumer 
magazines published by 161 publishers with a total circulation of 54,751,905. 110 of those 
161  publishers  publish  only  one  title,  with  a  further  36  publishing  two  to  four  titles.  The 
four most prolific publishers publish 181 titles between them. As is to be expected in such a 
broad and varied market, circulation varies enormously. Of the seven consumer magazines 
that have circulation of over a million, four are supermarket magazines, two are TV listings 
magazines  and  the  other  is  the  National  Trust  Magazine.  Other  magazines  circulated  to 
members  of  particular  associations  (for  example,  Saga  or  RSPB)  have  very  high  individual 
circulation. Beyond that there is no obvious pattern or rhythm to levels of circulation, with 
lifestyle, health and celebrity magazines varying considerably in popularity by title. Most of 
these consumer magazines are specialist interest titles of varying sorts and are not engaged 
in the sort of news and current affairs reporting, or reporting on individuals, with which the 
Inquiry is primarily concerned.

11.2  The magazines classified by ABC as ‘women’s interest weeklies’ include some of those best 
known for their coverage of celebrities and celebrity lifestyles. These 24 titles are published 
by 11 publishers and have a combined circulation of just over 7m.447

11.3  According to the Periodical Publishers Association (PPA) magazines are read by 87% of the 
population and, unlike newspapers, are particularly popular among the young, with at least 
91% of 15-24 year olds reading a magazine. Whereas newspapers are essentially ephemeral,

PPA survey in 2010 found that magazine publishers in both the business to business and the 
consumer market were positive about the future – 78% of consumer magazine publishers 
were profitable, with turnover in 2011 projected to rise by over 5% and 97% of publishers 
expected  profitability  to  remain  steady  or  improve.451  This  confidence  was  echoed  by  the 
editors of Heat, OK! and Hello! Magazines when they gave evidence to the Inquiry.452

Editorial practices and ethics of the magazine titles

11.5  The Inquiry has heard evidence from the editors of three of the most popular weekly magazine 
titles in Britain: Heat, OK! and Hello! Magazines. It has been evident that there are some 
similarities with newspapers in terms of practices of the magazine newsroom, awareness and 
application of the Editors’ Code of Practice, as well as the impact of technological change and 
the phenomenal growth of the internet as a source of news and information.

11.6  Heat Magazine employs 32 members of staff. These include three news desk reporters, one 
features editor and a number of reviews editors. The rest of the team comprise the art and 
production team.453 Hello! Magazine has forty employees, 19 of whom are either journalists 
or  subeditors.454  OK!  Magazine  use  only  in-house  journalists  and  employ  25  members  of 
staff.455

OK! Magazine

11.7  Northern and Shell owned OK! magazine is internationally one of best known and most read 
celebrity weekly magazines,456 and has a weekly UK circulation of 473,000, and an estimated 
readership of over 2m. The OK! Magazine website is managed and edited separately and has 
its own editor. Lisa Byrne, the current editor of OK! Magazine described her title as:457

“…basically  an  exclusive  invitation  into  the  rich  and  famous  and  celebrities  in  this 
country  and  the  States  with  worldwide  celebrities.  So  we  invite  our  readers  into 
people’s homes, to their babies’ christenings, first pictures of their children, amazing 
exclusive  weddings,  so  --  even  the  parties  are  exclusive,  so  it’s  just  a  fantastic 
aspirational magazine for readers to have a look at celebrities and their lifestyles.”

11.8  Ms Byrne told the Inquiry that the availability of news on the Internet has directly impacted 
the circulation celebrity magazines. She said that OK! Magazine now focuses less on celebrity 
news,  and  has  shifted  its  emphasis  on  more  exclusive  features  and  stories  which  are  less 
readily available online.458

Chapter 2 | The Press: History, Governance Structures and Finances C11.9  The majority of content that is published  in OK! Magazine is sourced either directly from 
celebrities or through their agents. Consent is therefore freely offered in most cases for the 
publication of such content. Ms Byrne told the Inquiry that approximately 80% of content is 
produced with the direct consent of those celebrities involved.459 The remainder of content is 
either “…bought-in interviews, celebrity features, news round-ups and celebrity columns”.460 
Such  material  is  subject  to  the  same  processes  of  verification  that  the  Inquiry  has  been 
told is common to all newsrooms; checks are made by sub-editors, senior editors and the 
legal department. Ms Byrne said that she is “…aware of almost every story that goes in the 
magazine”.461

11.10  The conduct of staff working at OK! Magazine is not subject to a specific code of practice. 
Nor does OK! Magazine subscribe to the PCC. However, Ms Byrne told the Inquiry that she 
expects her journalists to adhere to the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice. She argued 
that the efficacy of the reporting in OK! Magazine is dependent on a strict adherence to the 
Editors’ Code of Practice, as this is vital to maintaining the relationships that the title has built 
up with the celebrities on which they report.462 Ms Byrne also stressed the importance of 
ethics to the OK! Magazine newsroom, as well as her role in overseeing that ethical practices 
and standards are upheld on a day to day basis.

Heat Magazine

11.11  Heat Magazine is owned by Bauer Consumer Media Limited,463 which is a UK division of the 
German owned Publishing House, Bauer Media Group.464 The magazine attracts approximately 
320,000 readers a week. Heat Magazine also operates a website, which has been described 
by current editor, Lucie Cave, as an important feature of the Heat brand. The website attracts 
over 1m unique users each month. Ms Cave described the role of Heat Magazine:465

“…to cover the celebrities of the day in an entertaining fashion with an emphasis on 
interviews and amazing photo shoots that we do ourselves against a backdrop or a 
highly credible entertainment, TV and reviews section.”

11.12  In  addition  to  requiring  staff  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice,  Heat 
Magazine also require staff to adhere to the Bauer Group’s Best Practice Guidelines. Ms Cave 
stated to the Inquiry her expectations around journalistic standards and practice. Ms Cave 
fully  expects all staff working for Heat Magazine to follow the Code and Practice and the 
Bauer guidelines as well as fully obeying the criminal and civil law. The Bauer Group Best 
Practice Guidelines are reviewed on a regular basis and circulated to the newsroom.

11.13  Ms  Cave  told  the  Inquiry  that  content  is  subject  to  routine  checks  by  editors  during  the 
publication process, and external lawyers provide advice on an ad hoc basis as appropriate. 
The magazine publishes some content that originates from PR material, although Ms Cave 
was not able to quantify exactly proportion of the magazine is derived from such material.

PART C | The PressCHello! Magazine

11.14  Hello!  Magazine  is  owned  by  the  Spanish  Company  HOLA,  S.L.,  an  independently  owned 
family business.466 Between January and June 2011, Hello! Magazine recorded average total 
sales of 413,311 copies per week.467 The title also has an online website, which is independent 
from the magazine and is edited by a separate editor.

11.15  Rosie  Nixon,  joint  editor  of  Hello!  Magazine  described  the  title  as  promoting  the  positive 
portrayal of celebrity personalities. Ms Nixon said that the unwritten philosophy of Hello! 
Magazine  lies  in  the  phrase  “la  spuma  de  la  vida”  (the  froth  of  life),  words  attributed  to 
the founder of the company, Eduardo Perez’s, grandfather.468 Ms Nixon has told the Inquiry 
that:469

“…the function of the magazine… is to entertain. It’s to provide an insight into the lives 
of the rich and the famous. …we take a look at the lighter sides of the personalities 
that we feature.”

11.16  Hello! Magazine publishes ‘exclusive stories’. These are agreed in advance with the celebrities 
or  public  figures  concerned.  Additionally,  the  magazine  also  publishes  some  news-based 
stories obtained through a variety of PR agencies. She argued that as a weekly publication, 
Hello! Magazine is primarily focused on building “long-term relationships with personalities, 
rather than getting one-off ‘scoops.’”470

11.17  Journalists at Hello! Magazine are expected to abide by the PCC Editors’ Code of Practice. 
However, Ms Nixon told the Inquiry that “there are no formal internal documents relating 
to corporate of editorial governance beyond the PCC Code.”471 The title also does not have a 
formal policy in relation to payments to external sources, but Ms Nixon told the Inquiry that 
as a rule it does not make cash payments for any information. The majority of the magazine’s 
content  is  produced  in-house  by  pay-roll  staff;  a  smaller  amount  of  material  is  generated 
by freelance journalists, whose work is invoiced and processed according to the company’s 
procurement policies.472 Hello! Magazine makes payments for exclusive stories, and any fees 
are discussed and agreed with HOLA, S.L.’s CEO.

Introduction
For  centuries  the  printed  press  was  the  only  medium  that  brought  news  to  the  people. 
The  introduction  of  broadcasting  in  the  1920s  brought  a  new  voice,  but  one  that  had  a 
very different relationship with the public than that of the newspapers with their readers. 
Technological changes in the last few decades have completely revolutionised  the market 
in which newspapers are working, leading to the fragmentation not only in readership and 
advertising but also the introduction of news providers that are not currently a part of the 
self-regulatory, or indeed any other regulatory, regime. 

2.  Broadcasters
2.1 

The main source of news in the UK is broadcasting, with 59% of news consumption coming 
from the three main broadcasters (as opposed to 29% from the six main national newspaper 
groups).1 At the same time broadcasters reach a higher proportion of the public than any 
individual newspaper title, with 81% of those in the UK who consume news receiving some 
of their news from the BBC.2 

2.2 

96% of UK households have digital TV,3 offering 50 TV channels without subscription4 (and 
many more with subscription), including four free to view 24 hour news channels, with at 
least another six5 24 hour news channels in some subscription packages. With the significant 
exception of the BBC these broadcasters are either advertising or subscription funded. This 
means that broadcasters are competing with newspapers for sales, for audience time, and 
for  advertising  revenue.  Broadcasters  are  regulated  by  Ofcom,  operating  under  statutory 
powers, and are subject to the Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code. 

2.3 

The BBC
The BBC is a national public service broadcaster which is established by a Royal Charter6 (this 
was last renewed in July 2006, and came into force on 1 January 2007)7 and a Framework 
Agreement.8 The Royal Charter sets out the objectives and purpose of the BBC.9 There also

Media and Sport, which sets out the provisions of the BBC’s funding and regulatory duties.10

2.5 

2.6 

The BBC Trust is the sovereign body, responsible for making overall strategic decisions for 
the BBC. It has full oversight of the BBC Executive Board.11 Lord Patten, the current Chair of 
the BBC Trust, has made a clear distinction between the responsibilities of the Trust and the 
BBC Executive. As a sovereign body, the Executive is required to act in accordance with the 
governance set out by the Trust; equally, the Trust must not exercise the functions that are 
the responsibility of the Executive.12

A  number  of  individual  Boards  report  into  the  Executive  Board,  including  the  Editorial 
Standards Board. This is the main editorial forum for the discussion of editorial standards 
issues facing the BBC by senior editors, and where responses to such issues are formulated 
and discussed.13 The function of the Editorial Standards Board is therefore to monitor and 
review the editorial compliance systems which are in place at the BBC, in tandem with the 
Complaints Management Board.14

The former Director General of the BBC, Mark Thompson, explained to the Inquiry that he also 
served as the Head of the BBC’s Executive Board. As Editor-in-Chief he was directly responsible 
for the entirely of the BBC’s editorial and creative output.15 Mr Thompson described the BBC 
in the following terms:16

“…the  character  of  public  service  broadcasting  and  the  character  of  the  BBC’s 
editorial mission is different in many respects from that of some newspapers. The 
kinds [sic] of stories we do are different. In matters of privacy, our focus, when there 
is a debate about intrusions of privacy, are, I think without exception, in a journalistic 
context, around investigations into matters which I think everyone would accept were 
of public interest. …we don’t do any investigations into people’s private lives for their 
own sake.”

2.7 

The  BBC  meets  its  public  purpose  obligations,  set  out  in  the  Royal  Charter,  through  the 
distribution of information, education and entertainment. These are delivered on multiple 
platforms and include television, radio and online services.17

Corporate Governance

2.8 

The  BBC’s  Editorial  Guidelines  set  out  the  overarching  principles  underpinning  editorial 
management  at  the  corporation  as  well  as  defining  the  appropriate  structure  for  that 
management. These Guidelines, most recently revised in 2010 following a public consultation

commissioning these Guidelines from the Executive Board. In addition to the Guidelines, the 
BBC must also comply with sections of Ofcom’s statutory Broadcasting Code,19 including the 
Code on fairness and privacy. This safeguards the treatment of individuals and organisations 
in programmes broadcasted by the BBC. Compliance with the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines is the 
responsibility of the individual editor and producer.20 In addition to the Editorial Guidelines, 
there are separate Producers’ Guidelines. Certain programmes, particularly those which rely 
on investigative journalism, also have to abide by relevant individual handbooks. The BBC 
has  separate  policies  relating  to  complaints,  data  protection,  and  fraud  management  and 
ant-bribery.

2.9 

Different units at the BBC have responsibility for the general oversight of specific regulatory 
areas. For example, Fraud Management is overseen by the Investigations Unit under the overall 
supervision of the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Data Protection is 
overseen  by  the  Information  and  Compliance  Unit.  With  effect  from  1  October  2007,  the 
Controller,  Fair  Trading  was  appointed  as  BBC  Compliance  Officer.  There  is  also  a  Central 
Compliance Unit (also established in 2007) which is responsible for monitoring, improving 
and reporting on the BBC’s compliance obligations. The Compliance Unit is “not responsible 
for delivering compliance but is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate framework is in 
place to minimise compliance failures.” 21 Editorial policy compliance and financial compliance 
fall outside the remit of the Compliance Unit’s functions.

Regulation of the BBC

2.10  The BBC is regulated by the BBC Trust. The Trust has a ‘supervisory role’ which is generally 
restricted to the regulation of broadcast content after it has been transmitted.22 Lord Patten 
told the Inquiry that:23

“I would never ever seek to interfere with one of [Mr Thompson’s] editorial decisions. 
I wouldn’t, for example, ever ask to see a BBC programme, at least not in conceivable 
circumstances, before it was broadcast, if the Director General had decided it was 
worth broadcasting”.

2.11  However, Lord Patten also told us that there were occasions where the Trust would consider 
the principles of the Editorial Guidelines prior to transmission.24 The Trust exists to hold the 
Executive to account, ensuring that the BBC’s performance is in line with the public purpose 
set out in the Royal Charter. This includes: the BBC’s compliance with general law; regulatory

codes, strategies and other priorities. To this effect, the duty of the Trust is to ensure that the 
BBC functions in the interest of licence fee payers.25

2.12  Ofcom  is  responsible  for  the  regulation  of  some  aspects  of  the  content  produced  by  the 
BBC. This responsibility is defined in the Royal Charter and Framework Agreement, and the 
Communications Act 2003.26 Therefore, the regulatory jurisdiction of the Trust and Ofcom 
overlap in respect of this content. Ofcom exercises a regulatory function in relation to the 
BBC’s commercial activities, notably where they impact on the wider media market. All BBC 
commercial  services  must  comply  with  the  Ofcom  Statutory  Code,  and  Article  29  of  the 
Framework Agreement requires the BBC Trust and Ofcom to create a Joint Steering Group 
in  respect  of  market  impact  assessments.27  However,  the  BBC  Trust  assesses  the  market 
impact of “non-services” in-house (applying a Public Value Test). There is a clear delegation of 
function to Ofcom in relation to the assessment of the market impact of the BBC’s commercial 
activities. This is accompanied by an express recognition that Ofcom could play a greater role 
and offer assistance and expertise to the BBC, including in relation to areas which currently 
fall within the remit of the BBC Trust (such as non services).

2.13  Ofcom also exercises a role of oversight in relation to the editorial content of BBC output, 
specifically in relation to privacy and fairness. Where Ofcom finds a breach of the privacy or 
fairness sections of its Code, it may require the BBC to broadcast a statement of its findings.28 
Further,  should  Ofcom  find  that  the  Code  has  been  breached  “seriously,  deliberately, 
repeatedly,  or  recklessly”,29  it  can  impose  sanctions  which  range  from  a  requirement  to 
broadcast a correction or statement of finding to a fine of up to £250,000.30 Guidance on right 
to reply expressly refers to the requirement under the Ofcom Broadcasting Code to afford the 
person a timely opportunity to respond.31

2.14  The Inquiry has heard evidence of situations where editorial incidents have taken place, which 
have led the BBC Trust to commission independent investigations into apparent breaches of 
the Editorial Guidelines, and the decision to impose relevant sanctions.32 The scandal around 
the misuse of premium rate phone lines by the BBC in 2007,33 in which it was revealed that 
viewers had been invited to call premium rate numbers in order to enter competitions on 
programmes that had, in fact, been pre-recorded, is an example. The BBC Executive proposed 
an action plan and the BBC Trust commissioned an independent report by Ronald Neil. Mr Neil 
was appointed an independent editorial adviser to the Trust in order to review the Executive’s 
action plan. This resulted in the development of new training programmes, including the BBC

and Compliance Unit was created to look at audience interaction with the BBC.

In October 2008, two radio presenters, Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, made unacceptable 
phone calls to Andrew Sachs in the course of a radio programme aired in that month.35 In 
December 2008, BBC Management announced an action plan to address the editorial failings 
which had led to the programme being broadcast.36 The progress made under this action 
plan was then subject to an independent review carried out by Tony Stoller (former Chief 
Executive  of  the  Radio  Authority)  and  Tim  Suter  (former  broadcasting  partner  and  Board 
member at Ofcom) for the BBC Trust.37 Both the BBC Executive and the BBC Trust reported on 
the findings of that independent review.

2.16  Speaking to the importance to the BBC of addressing these failings in editorial conduct, Mr 
Thompson told the Inquiry about his role in informing the public of the necessary controls 
that have since been implemented, that: 38

“…it’s fundamental to my duty in this role. I think my job is to – to – not just to sit 
on top of a management machine and try and optimise it for editorial compliance – 
that’s, you know, in a senses, part of what one has to do to try and get the right result 
– but also to take responsibility for what the BBC broadcast and also to take personal 
responsibility for occasions when we have fallen short of our high standards.”

2.17  The recent revelations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile, and decisions around the Newsnight 
investigation into the matter, have raised questions in some quarters as to the effectiveness 
of  broadcasting  regulation  and  the  internal  governance  systems  within  the  BBC.  None  of 
this is a matter for this Inquiry, and there are separate inquiries into the specific issues. I 
merely  note  that,  without  in  any  way  prejudging  any  of  those  investigations,  the  original 
Newsnight investigations, the ITV documentary that ultimately revealed the allegations, and 
the subsequent Panorama programme that investigated the handling of the matter within 
the BBC, were produced within the constraints of broadcasting regulation, not by the print 
press. Any attempt, therefore, to suggest that broadcasting regulation has had any part in 
constraining reporting on the matter is simply not borne out by the facts.

Complaints system

2.18  The  BBC  is  required  to  comply  with  the  Royal  Charter  and  the  Framework  Agreement. 

Complaints to the BBC therefore have an important role to play:39

“The BBC’s complaints handling framework (including appeals to the Trust) is intended 
to  provide  appropriate,  proportionate  and  cost  effective  methods  of  securing  that 
that  BBC  complies  with  its  obligations  and  that  remedies  are  provided  which  are 
proportionate and related to any alleged non-compliance.”

PART C | The PressC2.19  The Trust has the role of final arbiter in appropriate appeals, and has responsibility for setting 
the BBC’s complaint framework.40 A Trust Protocol is established by the Trust, which oversees 
the  procedures  for  specific  areas  of  complaint,  including  editorial  complaints.41  This  is  to 
ensure a clear division of responsibilities between the Trust and the Executive. The Trust does 
not have a role in handling or adjudicating upon individual complaints in the first instance, 
unless the complaint is concerning the act or omission of the Trust itself.42 In this regard, the 
responsibility as final arbiter is delegated to the Editorial Standards Committee.

2.20  Any BBC viewer who is dissatisfied with any of the content broadcasted by the BBC may submit 
their complaint directly to the Corporation. Complaints that relate to fairness or privacy can 
also be made to Ofcom, in line with their regulatory jurisdiction over this form of content. 
Although the complainant can submit complaints relating to impartiality or accuracy issues to 
Ofcom,43 it is unlikely that Ofcom would entertain these types of complaints. Lord Patten told 
the Inquiry that, in practice, Ofcom would inform the complainant that such a complaint could 
be dealt with by the BBC.44 Equally, the Editorial Standards Committee is unlikely to consider 
a fairness and privacy or standards matter which overlaps with the regulatory responsibilities 
of Ofcom, until Ofcom has completed its own processes.45

2.21  Lord Patten explained the nature of the complaints system, whereby viewer complaints are 
dealt with at the first stage by the executive’s information department (possibly including 
the producers of the programme in question itself). Should no resolution result from this 
first stage of mediation, viewers can take complaints to a second stage process where they 
are handled by the complaints unit, governed by the Complaints Management Board (which 
reports directly to the BBC Direction Group).46 The last stage is the process of appeal to the 
Trust, should the complaint be unresolved to the satisfaction of the viewer.47

2.22  There  is  a  recognition  that  the  complaints  system  requires  improvement,  particularly  in 
order to speed up the process of reply. Lord Patten’s review of BBC Governance expressly 
acknowledged licence fee payers had expressed concerns that the current system was “too 
complicated and too slow”. He told the Inquiry that he has recommended the appointment 
of  a  “chief  of  editorial  complaints,  of  corrections”,48  whose  role  would  be  to  ensure  that 
the system was improved and operated in a transparent manner. The Governance Report 
concluded that the BBC should publish a single page guide explaining where complainants 
should go to complain about BBC broadcast content or services. Lord Patten told the Inquiry 
that the BBC will work with Ofcom to ensure there is common language in the guide to explain 
in  what  circumstances  complainants  may  complain  to  Ofcom.  Other  recommendations 
from the Governance Review include the streamlining of the appeals process and regular

on the BBC website. 

2.23 

In 2007, the BBC Editorial Standards Committee recorded that 94% of complaints had been 
dealt with within ten working days. In this regard, Mr Thompson informed the Inquiry that:49

“The BBC receives well over a million contacts from the public every year, of which 
only a relatively small proportion are complaints, but that still adds up to something 
like 240,000 complaints a year, of which the overwhelming majority are responded 
to very quickly. We have a target of responding in ten days. I think we’re currently at 
93,94 per cent of that target, and in, again, the overwhelming majority of cases, the 
complaint is satisfactorily dealt with at that stage.”

2.24 

ITN
ITN is a news provider responsible for the production of the news programme for the broadcast 
channel, ITV. ITN also produce Channel 4 News, through a contractual agreement between 
ITN and Channel 4.50 The Chair of ITN, Maggie Carver, is responsible for the organisation, but 
delegates editorial matters to the Chief Executive Officer, John Hardie, who is responsible for 
the management of editors of both ITV News and Channel 4 News.51 Ms Carver is responsible 
for ensuring that the corporate governance set out by the company is adhered to by staff. In 
part, this is done through the ITN’s Compliance Manual, the ITN Health and Safety Manual 
and the Ofcom Code.52

2.25  Compliance at ITN is the responsibility of the Head of Compliance, John Battle.53 Mr Battle is 
author of the Compliance Manual, first published in July 2004. The Compliance Manual sets 
out “the industry regulations that affect news reporting, the main areas of laws affecting 
journalism such as libel, copyright, privacy and contempt of court and internal ITN standards 
and procedures.” 54 This manual is the centrepiece guidance issued to staff at ITN and forms 
the basis of ITN staff training. 

2.26 

ITN  recently  reviewed  its  Compliance  Manual  in  light  of  allegations  of  phone  hacking,  as 
well as allegations of payments to public officials by journalists and others working at the 
NoTW. Although Jim Gray, Editor of Channel 4 News, told the Inquiry that the review of the 
Compliance Manual was regular procedure, he explained that additionally “as part of the 
process  triggered  by  this  Inquiry,  we  have  held  an  independent  external  Inquiry  into  ITN’s 
journalistic practices and some the [sic] findings of that will feature in the new Compliance 
Manual.” 55 Mr Battle also gave evidence to this effect, stating that:56

PART C | The PressC“It’s fair to say that as a grown-up and professional organisation, we’d have to have 
on board the Inquiry and what’s been discussed here and within the news. There have 
been some tightening up procedures, tilting, as you said this morning, sir, towards 
better regulation. I don’t think there’s been substantive changes as a result of this 
Inquiry but it also includes a lot of updates on other issues, such as Twittering in court 
or online posting, so it’s an update.”

Channel 4 News

2.27  Mr  Gray  is  responsible  for  the  entirety  of  editorial  content  of  Channel  4  News,  and  for 
upholding  relevant  policies  to  ensure  that  journalists  and  individual  editors  at  Channel  4 
News are required to comply with the ITN Compliance Manual.57 Mr Gray reports directly 
to Mr Hardie, ITN’s Chief Executive Officer. Mr Gray told the Inquiry that Channel 4 News 
applied similar principles to the Omand principles,58 which are “a whole series of tests about 
the proportionality of what is being proposed matches the level of gravity of what the story 
may be”.59

2.28  Mr Gray describes Channel 4 News as a public service news broadcaster with an editorial 
focus on news that is in the public interest. He has said that consideration is given as a matter 
course to issues of privacy, consent, and public interest; all of which are built into the ITN 
Compliance Manual.60 He also told the Inquiry that there is a culture at Channel 4 News of 
behaving ethically and acceptance of journalists being held to account for their reporting. Mr 
Gray said in this regard that:61

“We don’t want to cause any problems, and we certainly don’t want so [sic] have 
any incoming attack on our reputation or integrity which would then go forward to 
possibly damage Channel 4’s repute, which we are contractually obliged to uphold 
and we must uphold and we want to.”

Corporate governance at ITN and Channel 4 News

2.29  Mr Battle explained that although ITN is not a content broadcaster, the organisation is still 
obliged  to  operate  in  accordance  with  the  Ofcom  Broadcasting  Code,  as  well  as  with  the 
expectations and requirements of the individual broadcasters, ITV or Channel 4. 

2.30  There  are  three  levels  of  compliance  within  Channel  4  News:  the  ITN  system  and  core 
Compliance  Manual;  the  Channel  4  independent  producers’  handbook;  and  contractual 
obligations  between  ITN  and  Channel  4  which  require  consultation  and  notice  in  certain 
circumstances. Mr Gray told the Inquiry that the compliance manual “adds layers of practice, 
best practice and how to go around carrying out such investigations”.62 Separately, under the 
Ofcom Broadcasting Code, Channel 4 News is obliged to offer timely and appropriate rights of

Chapter 3 | Alternative News Providers Creply to the subject of a story.63 Mr Gray also described how Channel 4 News would approach 
a story that might involve potential breach of privacy:64

“…if  it  was  a  serious  allegation  of  wrongdoing  or  criminality,  we  would  normally 
expect to contact the subject of the story in writing, putting forward the claims and 
the allegations and the evidence we had for what was going to be proposed to be 
contained in the report, and then give sufficient amount of time for the subject to 
respond. That can vary, That’s not set down but it could be a matter of days or it could 
be longer. In some cases, depending on the response from the subject, it can drag on. 
…That’s part of the way it is and if you have a real good story, you will navigate your 
way through that.”

2.31  Commenting on the role of Ofcom in relation to Channel 4, and Channel 4 News, Mr Gray 
told the Inquiry that the Ofcom Broadcasting Code helps to codify the principles and cultural 
standards that Channel 4 News seeks to uphold. He explained this thus:65 

“…through the ITN guidelines, [we] turn [the Code] into practice, and that’s helpful 
as well, because for the team at ITN, that makes it our guidelines. It’s not an external 
imposition. This is our culture we’re expressing in the guidelines. It makes it more of 
a collaborative venture rather than: we’re only doing this because of – it’s a series 
of hurdles we have to overcome to get there. It can feel like that but it makes the 
journalism better at the end result.”

Complaints system

2.32 

In relation to complaints handling, Mr Battle told the Inquiry that ITN does not receive many 
complaints through Ofcom. He noted that, on average, ten complaints might be received in 
the course of a given year, and not all of these would be of a substantial nature.66 Complaints 
in relation to Channel 4 News are handled by Mr Gray’s Deputy Editor at Channel 4 News, 
who consults closely with the production team. The complaints are assessed in relation to the 
report in question with the Head of Compliance, documented as appropriate in consultation 
with Channel 4. Mr Gray explained that only in serious cases would a complaint be referred to 
him.67 However, should a complaint be submitted through Ofcom, then the complaint would 
be handled in accordance with the terms set down by the regulator. Mr Gray explained that 
Channel 4 News had received remarkably few complaints and, specifically, over the course 
of five years, “we haven’t actually had a finding against us from an Ofcom complaint except 
once… and that was a partial ruling against us on an investigation”.68

3.  the World Wide Web
3.1 

The media landscape, particularly the provision of news, both globally and in the UK has been 
transformed by the invention and phenomenal development of the Internet. At its simplest 
the  Internet  is  a  system  of  interconnected  computer  networks  which  use  a  standardised 
address system to enable the identification of each of the electronic devices that make up 
the network. Now literally billions of machines are linked. This means that huge quantities of

164

PART C | The PressCincreasingly complex information can be stored and accessed at ever greater speeds. It also 
means that the services that media providers can offer through the Internet to consumers 
can be ever more sophisticated, personalised and immediate.

In terms of access and reach, 74% of adults in the UK have access to broadband, with average 
actual speeds of 6.8Mbit/s.69 22% of all the time that adults spend engaging with media is 
spent on the internet, with this figure rising to 30% for those aged between 16 and 24.

The Internet also enables citizens to access news generated by sources across the world.70 
All  UK  media  organisations,  whether  newspapers,  broadcasters  or  others  now  have  an 
internet presence. Most of that content is available for free, although some, including some 
UK publishers, have begun to charge for online content. This free content can be accessed 
directly where the user knows what they are looking for, or can be found through search 
engines. 

In addition to the individual websites of the world’s news providers there are news aggregation 
services. Where a site is acting as an aggregator, it directs users to material created by others. 
These sites tend to rely on automatic selection through algorithms and usually involve no 
active editorial involvement by the aggregator. In some circumstances this will involve simply 
directing  the  user  to  the  website  of  the  news  provider.  In  others,  it  involves  essentially 
importing the news report from the original provider to the site of the aggregator. In the latter 
case this will mean that any associated advertising revenues will go to the aggregator rather 
than to the news provider. These sites are characterised by the fact that those operating the 
sites have little or no editorial input to the content of the material that they provide to users, 
take no responsibility for the accuracy of articles to which their users are directed, and have 
no role in the newsgathering process. 

Although some news sites are merely aggregators of news, linking to content hosted by other 
news websites, Google news is different. It is a function within Google that will search for 
material only through online news content.71 However, the content itself is not generated by 
Google, nor does Google operate any editorial control over the searched content beyond the 
algorithms that facilitate the search.72

In  addition  to  the  presence  that  traditional  providers  have  on  the  internet,  recent  years 
have also seen the growth of completely new approaches to news generation and provision. 
One example is the rise of blogs and other web-based news, current affairs and celebrity 
commentary.  Blogs  and  other  commentary  come  in  a  number  of  different  forms,  but  are 
essentially a personal commentary. They can include examples of ‘citizen journalism’ produced 
by individuals sharing their experience of, and views on, events that occur.

Regulation of the Internet
In  evidence  to  the  Inquiry,  the  Internet  has  been  described  as  an  unregulated  space,  in 
which businesses can avoid the regulation of a given jurisdiction by hosting the content they 
publish in a different legal jurisdiction. Witnesses to the Inquiry have said that this creates 
an imbalance with market consequences between what might be written by UK newspapers

Chapter 3 | Alternative News Providers Cand what might be published by websites hosted abroad.73 Witnesses have pointed to the 
publication of photos of, in particular, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, which 
though  different  in  terms  of  the  surrounding  circumstances,  highlight  issues  around  the 
existence of different jurisdictions and regulatory regimes as applied to the press and the 
Internet. The Sun has argued that the ready availability of photographs of Prince Harry on the 
Internet justified in part its decision to publish those same photographs.74

3.8 

To some extent, this is an accurate if very cursory reflection of the regulatory picture with 
regard to the Internet. However, it is a simplification that ignores what is a more complex 
picture. Certainly, the very nature of the Internet does not lend itself to regulation. It is a 
global  network  made  up  of  a  very  large  number  of  interconnected,  largely  autonomous 
networks,  operating  from  many  different  legal  jurisdictions  without  any  obvious  central 
governing body. Indeed, in many ways this loose and lightly regulated structure has been 
encouraged by governments and by users as a source of both innovation and growth. 

3.9 

This does not mean, however, that the Internet is without any governing principles. To ensure 
interoperability  of  the  constituent  networks,  as  well  as  consistent  policy  on  addressing, 
addresses and standards are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
and Numbers (ICANN), based in California, at which the UK Government is represented.

3.10  Access to Internet services is also regulated in the UK and Europe through telecommunications 
legislation  as  regulated  by  Ofcom.  Internet  services  have  predominantly  been  provided 
through the national copper wire telecoms network. The transmission of content wirelessly 
through the national radio spectrum network is regulated through the Wireless Telegraphy 
Act 2006 and has regulatory impacts for access to the Internet through wireless devices other 
than computers such as mobiles phones (especially smart phones like the iPhone), and other 
Internet enabled devices such as tablets (like the iPad and Kindles). 

3.11 

3.12 

In addition, just as the general law applies online as it does offline, some forms of online 
content are also regulated. Broadcast content, known as video on demand when it is made 
available  online,  through  for  example  the  BBC  iPlayer  service,  or  in  the  case  of  Channel 
4, through 4oD, is regulated by the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2009 and the 
Audiovisual  Media  Services  Regulations  2010,  by  the  Authority  for  Television  on  Demand 
(ATVOD). The necessary powers for the regulation of these services are delegated to ATVOD 
by Ofcom through a formal designation. These ensure that protections similar to those applied 
to broadcast content are applied to that same or similar content when made available online.

In addition to regulation of broadcast and equivalent content through ATVOD, UK Internet 
Service Providers have also taken a broadly self-regulatory approach to some of the content they 
host and have applied a limited number of standards to that content. In many circumstances, 
ISPs and others have cooperated with law enforcement and other agencies to remove illegal 
content or block access to it. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is an example of this self-
regulatory approach. The IWF works closely with ISPs to ensure that webpages, including 
those hosted outside of the UK, which provide access to potentially criminal content and, 
specifically, images of child abuse, are reported and removed or blocked at source.

3.13  The current reliance on collaborative approaches and industry self-regulation does not mean 
that enforcement of UK law online is not possible. However, successful prosecution relies 
on  considerable  cooperation  across  a  number  of  agencies,  not  least  the  ISPs  and  content

PART C | The PressCproviders,  and  is  most  effective  where  the  alleged  act  is  also  clearly  criminal  in  the  host 
country.

3.14  To this end, it is worth noting that Twitter and other social media have cooperated with UK 
law enforcement in cases of obvious criminality. During the rioting in the summer of 2011, 
both RIM Blackberry and Twitter worked closely with police and other enforcement agencies 
to  identify  those  using  social  media  and  communications  networks  to  perpetrate  or  help 
commit criminal acts. In 2011, Lancashire County Council also worked with Twitter to identify 
and bring prosecutions against individuals suspected of tax avoidance.

3.15  This relative lack of internet specific regulation is unlikely to change. The Government made 
clear  that  it  sees  the  Internet  as  a  key  driver  of  future  economic  growth  and  innovation, 
and has made public its commitment to an open but responsible Internet.75 This should be 
understood as an internet in which all legal content is available and there is no blocking of 
sites or discriminatory practice (such as prioritising one very similar product over another), 
and  where  the  industry  works  together  with  Government  to  deliver  solutions  to  issues 
particularly in relation to:
•  e-Accessibility;
•  harmful and inappropriate content; and
•  copyright.

3.16  Where legislation has been brought forward in relation to the Internet, this has been in response 
to legislative changes decided at a European level, intended to protect the privacy of users. 
Changes to the law have extended the powers available to the Information Commissioner’s 
Office to ensure that it has appropriate tools to do its job effectively in a digital age.76 These 
changes have extended the enforcement powers available to the ICO under the DPA into the 
Privacy and the Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), and include powers to:

•  levy civil monetary penalties for PECR offences; 
•  compel Communication Providers to disclose the identity of third parties; and
•  amend Assessment Notice powers which will enable the ICO to compel organisations to 

submit to an e-privacy audit. 

3.17  The  changes  have  been  made  in  response  to  concerns  at  a  number  of  high-profile  data 
breaches, some as a consequence of criminal hacking, others by the apparent unwillingness 
of  service  providers  to  pay  full  heed  of  data  protection  legislation  (as  in  the  case  of  the 
unintentional interception of data from wifi-wireless and remote internet devices by Google 
in 2009).77

Chapter 3 | Alternative News Providers Ctowards privacy online and related matters has changed considerably with time reflecting 
both the growth in the use of online services and the changing legal landscape with regard to 
the internet.78 Mr Collins said:79

“Google has always taken privacy seriously from a very strict compliance position; 
it’s taken privacy seriously because ultimately the trust that we have with our users 
is incredibly important.”

In this respect Google has worked hard to improve public awareness of privacy issues online, 
and in January 2012 launched the “good to know campaign” which actively sought to raise 
public  awareness  of  privacy  tools  in  relation  to  email,  social  network  accounts  and  other 
online functions that might help users to protect their privacy online.80

4.  Blogs and other web-based commentary
4.1 

The  Inquiry  heard  evidence  in  regard  to  the  operation  of  blogs,  online  news  aggregators, 
publishers, social network sites and online hosts.

4.2 

4.3 

4.4 

There are a number of news blogs – the Huffington Post is an early, high profile example of 
one, which has developed over the years into something much more like an online newspaper 
– which specifically aim to bring a range of news stories and views on those stories to their 
readers. Other examples include the Guido Fawkes Blog, which focuses on ‘tittle-tattle, gossip 
and rumours’ about Parliament;81 the Jack of Kent Blog,82 which describes itself as ‘liberal and 
critical’; and Popbitch, which is a celebrity newsletter and message-board. Camilla Wright, 
co-founder of Popbitch, told the Inquiry that her intention in founding Popbitch was to create 
a publication like Private Eye for the celebrity world that would:83

“...  look  at  the  hypocritical  gap  between  how  those  in  the  public  eye  seek  to  be 
portrayed and how they really act.”

There is no single format for these types of sites and individual sites can evolve, and have 
evolved, a great deal over time. Whereas Popbitch is clear in its ambition to entertain and 
understands itself to “poke fun” and comment on the “lighter” side of celebrity culture, Guido 
Fawkes, though ostensibly and in many respects similar, is different in nature. Paul Staines, 
the founder of the Guido Fawkes website, stated that Guido Fawkes actively seeks to break 
stories and prides itself on doing so ahead of the main news providers.84

The type and size of audience attracted by such blogs varies hugely and depends unsurprisingly 
on the content they carry. For example, Mr Staines told the Inquiry that the Guido Fawkes site 
generally had between 50,000 and 100,000 readers daily. However, when very big stories are 
being broken this can rise to as many as 100,000 visitors per hour.85 Mr Staines estimated that

between 25% and 30% of his readers reached the site through search engines.86 Popbitch, 
by contrast, has 350,000 subscribers, whilst Holy Moly, which also covers celebrity news and 
gossip, serves 6.5 million page impressions a month to 1.6 million people.87 

In  addition  to  the  stand-alone  blogs  and  sites  described  above,  many  established  news 
providers  also  use  blogs  –  for  example  the  Guardian  has  been  running  a  live  blog  on  the 
Leveson Inquiry since the first of the Inquiry seminars – either for specific events or issues, 
or just by way of communicating with readers in a different manner. At the other end of the 
spectrum,  many  individuals  run  blogs  on  matters  which  are  of  interest  to  them,  some  of 
which will, from time to time, cover issues of news or current affairs and some which may 
well break stories if the people writing them are well placed to do so.

These vastly different sites are all offered to the public in the same way; they all have the 
same theoretical reach to the entire internet-connected population at the touch of a button 
(particularly when facilitated by search engines). They are also, with the regulatory exceptions 
set out above, entirely unregulated, though subject to civil and criminal law in appropriate 
jurisdictions. However, it is noteworthy that although the blogs cited here are read by very 
large numbers of people, it should not detract from the fact that most blogs are read by very 
few people. Indeed, most blogs are rarely read as news or factual, but as opinion and must 
be considered as such.

Purpose and process

4.7  Ms Wright explained the nature and purpose of Popbitch as a gossip site. She said that she 
believed that the public had a right to know certain facts about certain celebrities, particularly 
given the ability of some to “shape and influence people’s lives.”88 Ms Wright argued that it 
is only right that publishers should bring material to the attention of the public if it brings to 
light what she described as the “gap between people’s private life and public life.”89 This she 
argues is not only very much in the public interest but is a reflection of everyday concerns 
that individuals may have, as well as the reality of celebrities and others putting potential 
personal or private information into the public domain through Facebook and other social 
media, that might sit uneasily or indeed at odds with their public persona.90

4.8  Ms Wright acknowledged that this may mean that the line between what is private and what 

might be made public is fluid and dependent on context:91

“We draw the line, I would say, we look at who is making themselves influential, and 
if so are they living up to it.”

4.9 

Understandably perhaps, for a relatively small operation, the standards of proof deployed by 
Ms Wright are lower, and the processes different from those that might be found on a print 
newspaper. Ms Wright said in relation to the corroboration of stories:92

Chapter 3 | Alternative News Providers C“If it is a contentious or controversial story , I would want to get someone else to back 
up what they’re saying and try and find if possible, some evidence to support what 
they’re both saying.”

4.10  Ms Wright also explained that whilst Popbitch may not have formal processes for establishing 
whether content might be in the public interest or a breach of privacy, the company does 
consult with and take advice from media lawyers, who have at times provided extracts from 
the Editors’ Code of Conduct which they perceive might be useful for Popbitch to consider.93

4.11  Much as Popbitch understand itself to provide information to the public that it determines 
to be in the public interest, Guido Fawkes also prides itself on its ability to deliver stories it 
understands to be in the public interest, that might otherwise remain unknown. Mr Staines 
said: 94

“I particularly don’t think people in public life, people who are, you know, paid for by 
the taxpayers, or subject to the voters, should expect the same degree of privacy as a 
private citizen who has no public life can expect. These people – their character speaks 
to what the voters need to know about them as politicians, so if they misbehave in 
their private life – it’s quite common that somebody who will lie to their wife will lie 
to the voters. That’s an old adage that has some truth to it.”

4.12 

Indeed, Mr Staines stated in evidence that he would publish information that he assessed 
to  be  in  public  interest  even  if  that  information  was  the  subject  of  a  legally  enforceable 
injunction. He referred in evidence to material made available by his blog which a court had 
ordered should be removed from the internet.95 This is explored in more detail below.96

4.13  Mr  Staines  also  gave  evidence  on  the  standards  and  editorial  processes  he  deploys  with 
regard to the content he publishes. He said that in many cases he is unable to corroborate 
stories through a second source:97

“Yeah,  quite  often  there’s  only  one  source  in  the  room  who  can  provide  us  with 
information,  so  we  have  no  choice.  We  don’t  rely  on  single  sourcing  from  people 
we don’t know. There has to be some authority to that person or we have to have a 
level of trust built up over time. If someone came in fresh and was a single source we 
couldn’t verify in any way whatsoever, I’d be very reluctant to run with it.”

4.14  Mr Staines also made clear that accuracy was as important to the credibility of a blog site 
like Guido Fawkes as it was for a print newspaper. It is for this reason that the majority of 
material sourced by Mr Staines was either verifiable or from a trusted source. Only some 10% 
of material might be from an unknown source.98

4.15  Additionally,  Mr  Staines  told  the  Inquiry  that  journalists  occasionally  provided  him  with 
material that an editor may have decided not to publish (that had been spiked), or that might 
not fit with the overall agenda of the publication in question.99 As such Guido Fawkes provides

PART C | The PressCa valuable vehicle for publication of such content. Guido Fawkes also receives material that 
journalists want to push further and establish whether the story in question has legs.100 

4.16  Mr Staines also stated, in a parallel that he himself has drawn with the former editor of The 
Sun, Kelvin Mackenzie, that he would run stories that are single sourced if the story was of 
little consequence, or in keeping with the overall tone of the Guido Fawkes site, namely, that 
it was gossipy or humorous in nature.101

4.17  Much as the Guido Fawkes site is used as a proxy by some newspapers and a means of running 
stories that might lead to a newspaper being challenged, Ms Wright said that Popbitch is 
also  occasionally  used  by  journalists  from  print  newspapers  in  this  manner.  However,  Ms 
Wright made clear that is a practice that she generally seeks to avoid. She noted that such 
an approach has not happened for some time.102 Ms Wright was also keen to emphasise that 
she would only publish such information if it were in the public interest. This, she said, has 
not yet happened.103

4.18  The Inquiry also heard evidence from the Carla Buzasi, Editor in Chief of the Huffington Post 
UK. In contrast to either Popbitch or Guido Fawkes, the Huffington Post UK is not a blog built 
around the knowledge and gossip of a given area, it is an online newspaper employing trained 
journalists and abiding by journalistic standards as set out in the Editors’ Code of Practice, 
as well as participating in the system of self-regulation for the press through the PCC.104 The 
Huffington Post UK also functions as a news aggregator and links to news content hosted on 
other websites, as well as hosting blogs for the discussion and dissemination of opinion.

4.19  Ms Buzasi gave evidence on the importance of trust to the Huffington Post UK, and particularly 
to its reputation as a news source. This has informed editorial and management decisions 
made around training and editorial guidelines.105 It is therefore expected that all stories are 
verifiable and are not single sourced. However, Ms Buzasi acknowledged that there may be a 
limited number of circumstances in which single sourcing was acceptable, but it was not the 
rule.106 A similar emphasis on trust is placed on those news sites that the Huffington Post UK 
will link to.

Regulation of blogs

4.20  Blogs and other such websites are entirely unregulated. The Huffington Post UK is unique in 
having opted to subscribe to the PCC. It is the only solely online news provider to have elected 
to this and did so in September 2011. Ms Buzasi suggested that membership of the PCC was 
a  natural  next  step  for  the  Huffington  Post  UK  as  it  had  long  abided  by  the  terms  of  the 
Editors’ Code of Practice. However, she expressed some frustration at that organisation’s lack 
of consideration for online publications and intimated that the process of joining revealed 
flaws inherent in the existing system.107 She noted that the Huffington Post UK was eventually

Chapter 3 | Alternative News Providers Ccategorised  by  the  PCC  as  a  regional  newspaper  although  it  is  in  reality  a  national  online 
publication with a substantive readership.108

4.21  By contrast, Ms Wright told the Inquiry that although she was aware of the PCC Code she saw 
no reason for Popbitch to be part of the system of self-regulation through the PCC. Instead, 
she said in response to questions from the Inquiry that she believed Popbitch’s own system 
of internal or personal regulation was more effective and better suited to the needs of the 
organisation.109 With regard to a future system of regulation for the press, Ms Wright was 
equivocal as to whether such a system would be something that Popbitch would consider 
voluntarily signing up to, the detail of that system depending. Ms Wright said that she would 
need to determine whether that system of regulation would be useful to Popbitch.110 

4.22  With regard to the oversight and regulation of content published by third parties, views of the 
Huffington Post UK to hosted and other user generated content on its site are broadly typical 
of other hosting sites. The Huffington Post UK does not pre-moderate or edit that content. 
Indeed, Ms Buzasi has said that:111

“We  want  to  have  their  personalities  shine  through  on  their  blogs  but  there  is  a 
framework to ensure that we’re – or our bloggers are complying with the law.” 

4.23  Mu Buzasi said that a small number of comments were routed through a filter which may pick 
up certain word combinations or profanities. These were then directed to a moderator for 
review.112 Comment that was flagged by users was also directed to a moderator for review.113

4.24  Ms Buzasi made clear that it was her firm belief that micro bloggers and small non-commercial 
bloggers should exist outside any formal system of regulation. She regards this freedom from 
regulation as a necessary condition for the nurture of creative talent and encouragement 
of  new  media  enterprises,  particularly  if  there  are  substantive  costs  associated  with  that 
system.114 

4.25  Google is by some margin the largest publisher of third party content to have given evidence 
to  the  Inquiry.  Specifically,  Google  hosts  user  generated  content  through  its  Blogger.com 
service. The service hosts blogging sites, and now hosts more than 1 trillion words. That total 
increases  at  rate  of  over  250,000  words  every  minute.115  Its  attitude  towards  the  content 
it  hosts  is  markedly  similar  to  that  of  the  Huffington  Post  UK.  All  content  hosted  through 
the service must comply with the terms of use. Beyond this, Google does not exercise any 
editorial control over the content it hosts on its blogger service.116 It does, however, provide 
a notice and take down service. Google’s legal Director, Daphne Keller, has said that while a 
blogger service is available only through the .com domain, Google will take steps to ensure

PART C | The PressCthat content originating from a given jurisdiction is compliant with local law, if it receives a 
complaint about the content in question.117

Funding models

4.26  Many blogs sites now run on a commercial basis. The largest blog sites are increasingly funded 
either in their entirety or in part by advertising, as is the case with both Popbitch and Guido 
Fawkes. Although the approach to what appears on the website or blog will vary from site 
to site, the technical costs associated with running a site of this sort are relatively low, and 
barriers to entry to the market for both new players, be they individuals or much larger firms, 
are similarly low. Effectively, anyone with access to the Internet can set up a blog and seek to 
reach readers. 

5.  Social networking sites
5.1 

A social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that focuses on the building 
and reflecting of social networks or social relations among people who, for example, share 
interests and/or activities. A social network service essentially consists of a representation of 
each user (often a profile), his/her social links, and a variety of additional services. Most social 
network  services  are  web-based,  providing  means  for  users  to  interact  over  the  Internet, 
potentially through e-mail and instant messaging. Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and 
Google+ are all social network sites. 

5.2 

Although there is limited news provision  in the terms that are relevant to this Inquiry on 
pure  social  networking  sites,  all  social  networks  provide  opportunities  for  individuals  to 
disseminate  and  discuss  news,  information  and  comment.  Indeed,  everyday  use  of  the 
Internet is increasingly characterised by the use of social networking sites and other social 
media. Their growth has been little short of phenomenal. Ten years ago there were no social 
networks; now the largest social networking site, Facebook, has over 800m users worldwide 
(although  Facebook  has  recently  suggested  that  as  many  of  100m  of  these  accounts  may 
be either dormant, fake or used for questionable  purposes).  The rise of Twitter has been 
similarly rapid. Founded in 2006, it now counts over 100 million active users each month, 
sending a billion tweets every four days.118 Perhaps most astonishingly (and for this Inquiry of 
concern to those who may be the subject either of Tweets that breach privacy or indeed the 
criminal or civil law), is the speed with which a message might be propagated. Colin Crowell, 
Head of Global public Policy for Twitter Inc, noted that during the 2012 Superbowl, Twitter 
processed 12,000 tweets per second.119

5.3 

Increasingly  newspapers  themselves  not  only  use  the  pages  of  social  networking  sites  to 
disseminate news, but also provide platform friendly applications, to enable the application 
to be accessed through the specific social media. However, it is worthy of note that despite 
their extraordinary growth, as with most blogs, in the main few tweets or social network 
pages are read by very large numbers of people. Although a very small number of tweeters 
are followed (though not necessarily read) by very large numbers of people, and such may at 
times have significant impact (the Inquiry has heard evidence from Stephen Abell of the PCC

5.6 

of the phenomenon of Fry-bombing),120 it should not detract from the fact that most tweets 
are read by very few people. The television personality and actor, Stephen Fry, one of the 
most prolific celebrity tweeters has over 5 million Twitter followers. 

Although  social  networking  sites  are  not  obviously  in  competition  with  newspapers  for 
audience, revenue or advertising, they may be used to publish information that would not be 
able to be published by a newspaper in conformity with the standards set by self-regulation. 
In a practical, though not a legal, sense they might also be used to publish information that a 
court has ruled should not be published with little likelihood of the publisher being identified 
and held to account. Indeed, there are clear and very recent examples of this practice that do 
not need to be repeated here. 

It is in this regard that Twitter has been the focus of some interest to the Inquiry because 
of the role played by users in identifying individuals who had been the subject of privacy 
injunctions. Twitter allows members to operate anonymously, or under a pseudonym,121 and 
it is also possible that the company itself may not know the real identity of any member.122 
However, Twitter has told the Inquiry that its rules forbid members from using the service for 
any unlawful purpose,123 and any material that is found by the company to contravene that 
policy can be taken down or removed.124 

In  this  respect  Twitter  is  similar  to  other  social  media.  Most  social  networking  sites  and 
publishers of user generated content operate acceptable use policies (AUPs) which set down 
guidelines for user behaviour on those sites and cover issues such as posting of offensive 
content and bullying. Where a policy is breached, material is removed and in some cases the 
user’s profile is deleted.

5.7  Most recent trends in social network technology have been towards the concept of “real-
time web” and “location based” services. The real time web service allows users to generate 
content, that is broadcast as it is being uploaded – the concept is potentially analogous to 
and may indeed come to challenge live radio and television broadcasts as well as traditional 
print media.

5.8 

5.9 

Indeed, the instant nature of social networking also differentiates it from more traditional 
media. Rebuttals and denials of allegations can take place instantly, helping if not to kill a 
story at least to provide the subject of the story with a voice and make users aware that the 
veracity of the allegation or story may be in doubt. 

Consideration of the law
The  major  websites  and  providers  of  internet  services,  be  they  social  networking  sites  or 
providers of other services or functionality, tend to operate under US law if that is where 
the company is based. However, as witnesses to the Inquiry representing Internet firms have 
sought to make clear, where services are targeted at a given jurisdiction, they will also seek 
to comply with local law. This can and does lead to conflicts of law, for example, where issues 
such as consideration of privacy and other related matters conflict with rights under the First 
Amendment of the American Constitution.

PART C | The PressCBlogs and the consideration of the law

5.10  The  Inquiry  has  heard  much  evidence  in  this  regard.  Ms  Wright  said  that  as  Popbitch  is 
published  in  the  UK  it  abides  by  general  law.  This  includes  making  efforts  to  ensure  that 
content is not defamatory.125 Ms Wright was keen to emphasise, echoing points made by 
other witnesses representing online publishers and Internet businesses, that Popbitch sought 
to obey the local law in each of the jurisdictions in which it operated.126 Asked by Counsel to 
the Inquiry whether she considered the privacy of individuals about whom she writes, Ms 
Wright said:127

“In era where injunctions have been such a much-talked about thing, that obviously 
has to be a consideration. I think if I could put it this way, Popbitch is an entertainment 
product,  therefore  we  are  trying  to  do  no  more  than  poke  fun  in  the  world  of 
celebrity….. We get a lot of stories in [sic] which we don’t print, which are things like 
somebody’s gone to rehab, somebody has cancer, or it’s about their children.”

5.11  Ms Wright also said that consideration of privacy issues was more important to Popbitch than 
it once was. In evidence she referred to the example of Victoria Beckham’s pregnancy, noting 
that at the time the pregnancy was widely discussed, and that although Popbitch were the 
first publishers to write about the story, the fact of that pregnancy was no secret. However, 
Ms Wright has said further:128

“I would be I think since then much more careful about making sure that a pregnancy 
was beyond twelve weeks before – in this case, this was that as well, but I would be 
very careful about doing that.”

5.12  Mr Staines provided different and interesting evidence in relation to legal accountability and 
enforcement, particularly in relation to legal jurisdictions, that illustrates well the problems 
in  respect  of  the  application  of  national  law  by  online  publishers.  Mr  Staines  was  candid 
about this. He said that the servers used by the Guido Fawkes site are located in the USA. The 
site was previously hosted by Google on the Google free blogger system but, as Mr Staines 
explained, was moved when Google “became more willing to give in to legal threats.”129 Mr 
Staines said by way of further explanation:130

“I thought it be a good moment to switch from them to a hosting provider who was 
robust and would stand up for my First Amendment protections.”

5.13  This switch from Google to another blog host was made in order to make it more difficult 
for  content  Mr  Staines  had  published  to  be  challenged  through  the  UK  courts;  he  cited 
the experience of Wikileaks as a sufficient justification for this course of action.131 Further, 
Mr Staines stated that although he had been threatened with legal action on a number of 
occasions, no such action had been successfully prosecuted. Mr Staines also made clear that 
he has ignored UK Court decisions without adverse consequences.132

Chapter 3 | Alternative News Providers C5.14  He  gave  the  specific  example  of  a  memorandum  prepared  by  Merrill  Lynch  setting  out 
concerns at the future prospects of Northern Rock which suggested that the eventual cost to 
the taxpayer might be as much as £50bn.133 Mr Staines said that he uploaded the memo in 
question onto a number of overseas servers to circumvent injunctions issued by the law firm 
Carter Ruck.134

5.15  The  attitude  of  Mr  Staines  revealed  in  evidence  with  regard  to  compliance  with  national 
law was unique among witnesses from online businesses who have given evidence to the 
Inquiry. More typical were those of the Huffington Post UK, which have already been partly 
addressed. Ms Buzasi was clear that the Huffington Post UK abides by UK law. Under the 
terms of use, users of the Huffington Post UK comment boards and blogs must undertake not 
to post anything that might be illegal. Users must also provide personal details, which means 
that legal orders or proceedings can be enforced should either legal action be brought or an 
injunction be imposed.135 However, she also explained that the Huffington Post UK was not 
able to review and “pre-moderate” potentially libellous or defamatory comment, a theme 
that was taken up by other witnesses to the Inquiry.136 Ms Buzasi suggested that the inability 
of the Huffington Post UK to make adjudications in such matters is, to some extents, mitigated 
by provisions made for the correction of inaccurate or potentially actionable material through 
the prominent provision of “send a correction button”; the site also operates what Ms Buzasi 
has referred to as a “robust” notice and take down process.137

6.  Other providers
6.1  Mr Crowell made clear that it would be both technologically and physically impossible for 
Twitter to pre-moderate the user-generated content hosted by Twitter, in this case tweets, 
and adjudicate on their potential illegality.138 In this respect, the position of Twitter is markedly 
similar to that of both Google and Microsoft in relation to user-generated content. Articulating 
the position of Google with regard to compliance in this area, Ms Keller explained that given 
the volume of material generated by third parties that Google either indexes, searches or 
hosts depending on the relevant Google service or function, it is impossible for Google to 
pre-moderate that content in any way or, to make adjudications as to whether content is legal 
or not.139 Ms Keller has made clear that both the volume and nature of the content make 
such decision making practically impossible. She told the Inquiry that such filtering is also 
technically impossible and would also run the risk of legal challenge if content that had been 
posted entirely legally were removed inadvertently as a consequence of such filtering.140 

6.2 

However, Mr Crowell was keen to stress that recent technological changes since the start of 
2012 have enabled Twitter to withhold tweets within a given jurisdiction. This will enable 
Twitter to comply more effectively with differences in local law in different jurisdictions.141 Mr

PART C | The PressCCollins also provided further evidence of Google’s evolving policies with regard to compliance 
with national law. He said that Google services targeted at a particular country comply with 
local law and that this applies as much to privacy and other related matters as it does to other 
areas of law.142 By way of example, Mr Collins explained that Google policy on privacy in the UK 
was shaped through an ongoing dialogue with the ICO, which had provided relevant advice.143 
Ms Keller explained that the use of the .co.uk domain name underpinned the provision of 
services to the UK as well as compliance with the local law.144

6.3  Ms Keller also explained the number of routes through which an individual might seek to 
remove material made available through Google services. It is notable, and indeed unfortunate 
– although given the technological constraints understandable – that in each example the 
burden  of  effort  lies  with  the  injured  party.  Ms  Keller  explained  that  webmasters  (those 
who author and maintain websites) are able to request that their site is not indexed and will 
therefore not appear in searches.145 Ms Keller also said that this particular approach is in the 
view of Google the most effective means of getting content removed. Google also provides a 
“remove content from Google” service, which users may use to alert staff to potentially illegal 
content which will be taken down if it is understood not to comply with UK law.146 Google has 
adopted a similar, expedited approach in relation to content that is in breach of copyright.147

7.  enforcement
7.1 

Despite  the  efforts  made  to  comply  with  national  law,  it  is  clear  that  the  enforcement  of 
law and regulation online is problematic. Although the law with regard to online content is 
clear, and UK hosted content is by and large compliant, the ability of the UK to exercise legal 
jurisdiction over content on Internet services is extremely limited and dependent on many 
things (explored below) which are rarely aligned. These include: the location of the service 
provider; the location of the servers on which material is held; and international agreements 
and treaties.

7.2 

Internet Service Providers offering services to UK customers will block content that has been 
declared illegal. They are, however, understandably unwilling to make decisions on whether 
content may or may not be illegal or to take decisions where there are grey areas in law. 
This has been particularly apparent in cases of alleged defamation, where ISPs and content 
providers have historically been unwilling to remove content without a court decision. Whilst 
the position of the ISPs and content providers may be understandable – issues clearly arise as 
to their ability to decide on the veracity of an allegation – in some cases considerable damage 
may have been done to the subject of those allegations before a judgment has been reached 
and the defamatory content consequently removed. 

7.3  Most successful attempts to induce service providers of any sort to take enforcement action 
in  relation  to  content  are  either  through  agreement,  or  dependant  on  case-specific  court 
orders. In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Crowell (as well as representatives from Microsoft 
and Google) said that Twitter would enforce orders made by UK courts, in so far as they might

Chapter 3 | Alternative News Providers Capply to UK users, on a case by case basis.148 In practice, this means that for Twitter to remove 
a defamatory tweet that was re-tweeted, a court order would be needed in relation to every 
relevant tweet by every individual unique user who repeated that defamatory content.149 

7.4  Ms Keller has also made clear that, in cases of alleged defamation, it is Google policy in most 
cases only to remove material from a given service if the complainant was able to provide a 
legal judgment in support of their claim. However, Ms Keller acknowledged that while such 
material would be removed from a UK search, it might still be found through Google.com if 
the material in question was not in breach of American law.150 This means in practice that, 
in order to have material removed from searches in multiple jurisdictions, a legal application 
would have to be made in each relevant jurisdiction. Ms Keller said in this respect that she 
hopes: “this would not be a difficult thing to do.”151 It is notable that much as Twitter requires 
a court order in respect of each individual user, Google require such an order in relation to 
individual URLs.

7.5 

Both  examples  are  also  in  counterpoint  to  the  number  of  instances  where  UK  legislation 
and decisions by UK courts are simply ignored, as they are unenforceable. Content providers 
headquartered in the United States will also strenuously defend rights to free speech under 
American law and indeed may themselves be at risk of prosecution if they remove allegedly 
defamatory or potentially illegal content ahead of a court decision. This position is not without 
legal  underpinning  under  European  Law.  Under  Article  15  of  the  European  eCommerce 
Directive which sets out the regulatory framework for trade through the Internet, ISPs are 
not legally responsible for the content they carry over their pipes.152 This defence is known as 
mere conduit. Mr Collins of Google described the apportionment of responsibilities between 
publishers and host thus:153

“Firstly, there is a very clear set of regulations which apply to technical intermediaries 
hosting platforms. It’s called the E-commerce Directive and it does place a number of 
responsibilities on us around removal of content. I know that you’re very aware of it. 
It’s important to make the distinction between – in the system that you’ve outlined, 
it’s  important  to  make  the  decision  between  someone  who  provides  a  hosting 
platform for other people to create and post content, and a publisher. Blogger.com or 
other products that are – attempt to form a community around the product, YouTube, 
et cetera, they don’t make us a publisher; we remain a hosting platform. So I think 
whatever system that you devise, it’s important to retain that distinction, because not 
only is there already a very clear set of regulations around those principles placing 
responsibilities on us, but it retains a very essential balance online, which is: where 
does that responsibility lie? We have our responsibilities, which we fulfil; the person 
that produces and uploads that content has his or her responsibilities as well.”

7.6  Mr Staines also described with some colour the difficulties that an individual or company 

might encounter in trying to have content removed from the internet:154

PART C | The PressC“I think it is impossible for them to do anything, I would basically upload it to a free 
hosting service after the close of business hours, so if the law firm was contacting 
Yahoo India, they would find that there would be no one at home and it would be up 
on that website until the next day at the very least.”

8.  press photographers
8.1 

Press  photographers  are  another  source  of  news  material.  Their  actions  and  conduct  are 
covered  elsewhere  in  this  Report  as  appropriate,  so  I  will  restrict  myself  to  a  very  few 
comments  in  this  regard.  Based  on  figures  provided  by  the  British  Press  Photographers 
Association  (BPPA),  it  is  estimated  that  there  are  around  800  press  photographers  in  the 
UK.  Of  these  around  a  quarter  are  directly  employed  by  newspapers  or  agencies,  around 
12% are employed on fixed term or rolling contracts, around 18% work through agencies as 
freelancers and the remaining 45% are entirely freelance.155 

8.2 

Those photographers who are directly employed, whether by newspapers or by agencies, 
might expect to be subject to the Editors’ Code of Practice. Indeed, the Inquiry has been 
told by witnesses both from picture agencies and newspapers that the expectation is that 
press photographers would abide by the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice.156 Those who 
operate on a freelance basis are not subject to any regulation beyond the law, as it applies to 
everyone. 

8.3  Much  of  the  work  undertaken  by  press  photographers  involves  arranged  photo  shoots 
of  one  sort  or  another.  However,  press  photographers  obviously  do  also  work  by  waiting 
for potential subjects and hoping to get pictures of them. This inevitably gives rise to the 
risk that photographs will be taken in situations where the subject might prefer not to be 
photographed  and,  as  is  made  clear157  elsewhere  in  this  report,  may  even  be  subject  to 
harassment or distress. 

8.4 

8.5 

The death of Diana, Princess of Wales,158 in an accident that occurred while the car in which 
she was travelling was being pursued at high speed by a number of press photographers in 
1997 brought  the  role  and  behaviour  of  press  photographers  very much  to  public  notice. 
Since then, UK newspaper editors have been committed by the Editors’ Code of Practice not 
to publish images that are taken in contravention of the Code. The responsibility for checking 
whether the Code of Practice has been breached in relation to any specific image sits with 
the newspaper concerned. 

The market for celebrity and news photographs is now a global one. A picture that might be 
turned down by a UK editor as not being consistent with the Code might well be accepted 
by non-UK newspapers, broadcasters or websites. Recent cases involving Prince Harry and 
the Duchess of Cambridge are instructive and are described elsewhere in this Report.159 The 
largely freelance nature of the press photography business means that there is a high level of 
competition among photographers to get the best picture.

plurality

“I think sometimes – a lot of the time it isn't necessarily the size of the newspaper 
group, it's the strength of voice of the paper. I mean, actually, the Daily Mail is an 
incredibly  sort  of  powerful  voice  in  the  nation's  politics  because  it's  a  very  strong 
product, it puts its voice very powerfully, and that's not related really to its market 
power, it's [related] to the way it pushes its agenda.” 1

1.	 What	is	plurality	and	why	does	it	matter?
1.1 

There is a generally held view that the media is of central importance for a healthy, well-
informed democracy and therefore control of the media should not be concentrated in too 
few hands. This is based on a concern that a small number of media owners could have too 
much influence in terms of content and, in particular, agenda setting. Policy and legislation 
have  been  designed  overall  to  achieve  a  range  of  different  media  “voices”,  which  enable 
consumers to have access to a range of views, which helps them to actively participate in the 
democratic process in the widest sense. 

1.2 

The Communications Act 2003 takes two different approaches to the nature of the plurality 
that  is  considered  important.  The  first  is  the  need  for  a  “sufficient  plurality  of  views  in 
newspapers in each market for newspapers”2 and the second is the need for “there to be a 
sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving [every] audience 
[in the UK].”3 The difference between a plurality of views and the plurality of persons with 
control of media enterprises is clear. The rationale as to why the first should apply in relation 
to newspapers and the second in relation to media enterprises is less clear. In any event, the 
media market has moved on considerably since the Communications Act 2003 was passed 
and the nature and number of media enterprises serving markets in the UK has changed. 
Witnesses to the Inquiry took various approaches to what they understood by the need for 
plurality in the media.

1.3 

Ofcom defines plurality with reference to the desired outcome of a plural market:4

(a) “ensuring there is a diversity of viewpoints available and consumed across 

and within media enterprises;

(b) preventing  any  one  media  owner  or  voice  having  too  much  influence  over 

public opinion and the political agenda.” (emphasis added)

1.4 

Professor Chris Megone, Professor of Inter Disciplinary Applied Ethics at the University of 
Leeds,  described  both  the  benefits  that  a  free  press  brings  and  the  risks  of  a  few  voices 
dominating the public debate:5

“freedom of individual expression may be served to some extent by a free press in that 
such a press provides a vehicle for the expression of opinion in leader and comment 
columns. Such free expression can contribute to informed citizens through its role in 
the cut and thrust of ideas. However clearly there are only a limited number whose 
ideas are expressed in this way, and even with letters pages, and invited contributions 
from politicians and the like, the number able to express themselves is very small.”
and later:

“This argument could be taken further and it could be said that the public interest 
in freedom of expression can even be adversely affected by a free press, if certain 
other conditions hold such that some voices get much more prominence than others. 
In those conditions the power of the press as a medium of expression may lead to 
certain views dominating the public sphere and other views being squeezed out.
So the public interest in freedom of self-expression, or freedom of opinion, is served 
by a free press, but only to some extent, and only if the structure of the press allows 
for sufficient diversity.” 

1.5 

1.6 

This approach to both the diversity of views available and the influence wielded seems to be 
generally accepted. Robin Foster, an independent adviser on regulatory policy and strategic 
issues in the communications sector, described two aspects of plurality that he considered 
important: to make sure that there was a reasonable wide range and diversity of news and 
opinion available to the public, and to make sure that no single one of those news providers 
became  so  powerful  that  they  had  too  much  of  an  influence  on  opinion-forming  and  the 
political  agenda.6  Professor  Steven  Barnett,  University  of  Westminster,  said  that  plurality 
must encompass both a sufficient number of competing media enterprises and (separately) 
the prevention of an unhealthy accretion of power by any single enterprise.7

The rationale for requiring plurality within the media and the different dimensions of it that 
are  important  seem  uncontroversial.  However,  it  is  also  necessary  to  say  what  the  scope 
of media plurality should be. Ofcom notes that both they and other regulatory authorities 
have concentrated to date on news and current affairs, but that this is not required by the 
legislative framework.8 There are arguments for broadening the scope, which are considered 
later in this Report.9 Historically, regulators have not really looked beyond news and current 
affairs when considering plurality.

2.  approaches to securing plurality
2.1 

Attempts  to  secure  plurality  have  tended  to  rely  on  four  complementary  approaches.  First, 
where broadcast media are concerned, it can be argued that the existing rules around accuracy 
and impartiality should counter concerns about concentration of ownership.  The Department 
of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) argues that this is true up to a point, but it is difficult to 
regulate the coverage and prominence of stories. Therefore, there is still considerable scope for 

6  p3, lines 4-10, Robin Foster http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-

influencing the agenda by the extent to which particular stories are covered or not.10 A wider 
range of media owners makes it harder for one or two large owners to distort the agenda in a 
way which suits their own purposes.

Second, there have been specific rules constraining the ability of any one person or company 
to own too large a proportion of the broadcast market, and restrictions on the extent to which 
any one person or company can own both a national newspaper and a national terrestrial 
television channel or a local newspaper and a local television channel. These rules and how 
they have changed over time are outlined below. 

Third, there is general competition law. One of the key aims of competition law is to ensure 
that no company has such a position of power within a market that it can abuse that power, for 
example to force competitors out of the market to the detriment of consumers. Competition 
law  is  designed  to  reduce  concentration  of  market  power  and,  therefore,  will  generally 
produce outcomes which support plurality. However, competition rules are also designed to 
prevent abuse of market power; it is possible that an owner could have a dominant position 
which he did not abuse in competition terms (and which will therefore be allowed under 
the competition regime) but which was deemed undesirable in relation to plurality. It is also 
likely  that  competition  rules  are  less  able  to  prevent  unacceptable  levels  of  cross-media 
ownership where each market may be seen as distinct for competition purposes. Yet this 
form of ownership is sometimes seen as being of most concern because it could allow an 
owner to promote an agenda across a number of platforms which could be more influential 
than involvement in just one. This was the position originally taken by the Government in 
relation to media mergers when the 2003 Communications Bill was published. 

The process by which that position changed and how the current provision in the 2003 Act 
relating to media mergers was introduced is fully documented later in the Report.11 The result 
was that the Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to allow the Secretary of State to 
take public interests considerations relating to plurality into account in proposed media mergers. 

The media ownership regime takes as its starting point the position that a variety of owners 
will represent a variety of different viewpoints. This cannot be taken as axiomatic as owners 
could have a very similar set of views and values. It is nevertheless likely that the greater 
the number of owners, the greater number of views. Moreover, it is difficult to regulate for 
different points of view, so ownership restrictions act as an effective “proxy” for plurality.12

2.6  Media ownership rules act as a constraint on the normal workings of the market, so successive 
Governments have thought it important to strike an appropriate balance between the needs 
of plurality and the needs of the wider economy, and to ensure that media ownership rules 
are no more burdensome than necessary. As more and more services become available on 
different platforms, concerns over ownership have diminished to some extent and greater 
liberalisation has been permitted. The DCMS “Consultation on Media Ownership Rules” in 
November 2001 said:13

“The current ownership rules are being overtaken by a changing media landscape. 
In devising new, forward-looking legislation, we have two main aims. We want to

However,  we  must  also  allow  the  media  to  continue  to  perform  its  vital  role  in 
democratic society, as a forum for public debate and opinion.” 

3.  the history of media ownership rules in the uK from 

the 1990s 

3.1 

3.2 

Legislative background
DCMS has very helpfully provided a detailed history of the Media Ownership Rules in the UK 
from the 1990s to the most recent developments; this can be viewed as part of the evidence 
submitted to this Inquiry.14 For the purposes of the Report I merely summarise the key points. 

The constitutional framework for UK commercial terrestrial television and local radio sectors 
during  the  1980s  was  provided  by  the  Broadcasting  Act  1980  and  consolidated  in  the 
Broadcasting Act 1981.15 The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) had the function of 
providing television and radio services additional to those of the BBC. It therefore acted as 
both broadcaster and regulator. It did this by entering into contractual arrangements with 
ITV  and  Independent  Local  Radio  franchisees,  whereby  the  contractors  agreed  to  supply 
programmes  for  their  regions  and  the  IBA  agreed  to  transmit  them.  The  IBA  had  wide 
powers to preview programmes and approve schedules in advance of transmission. The issue 
of ownership restrictions did not therefore arise as providers of commercial TV and radio 
services were not owners of licences but contractors to the IBA.16

3.3 

The Broadcasting Act 1990 made significant changes to this regime by abolishing the IBA and 
establishing the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority instead. The 
main effects of the Act were as follows:17 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

The previous contract-based regulatory system was replaced by a licensing system, with 
each licence subject to certain conditions and penalties for non-compliance;
Licences for certain services were to be awarded by the ITC and RA through competitive 
tender to the highest bidder after a quality threshold and sustainability test had been 
passed, except in exceptional circumstances;
Cable and satellite programme licences were to be issued on compliance with the ITC 
codes’ consumer protection requirements;

(d)  Channel  4  was  to  be  provided  by  a  new  non-profit  making  body,  the  Channel  Four 

Corporation, under licence from the ITC; and

(e)  Provision was made for the licensing of a new terrestrial television service, Channel 5 

(which came to air in 1997).

3.4 

The Broadcasting Act 1990 introduced ownership restrictions that licences could be held and 
traded.    It  also  introduced  an  upper  limit  on  any  person  owning  more  than  two  Regional 
Channel 3 licences.18 The Broadcasting Act 1996 imposed a limit of one licence where the

licence-holder’s  total  audience  share  was  over  15%,  and  provided  that  a  national  licence 
could only be held for either Channel 3 or Channel 5.19

The Communications Act 2003 repealed the two rules which prevented the joint ownership 
of National Channel 3 and Channel 5, and removed stand-alone accumulation limits for all 
television licences. ITV plc (which resulted from the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004) 
now holds all but three of the 15 Regional Channel 3 licences (those being UTV and Northern 
and Central Scotland).20

Provision of broadcast news

Specific  controls  were  introduced  to  ensure  plurality  of  the  provision  of  broadcast  news. 
The Broadcasting Act 1990 allowed for the ITC to nominate news providers who would be 
eligible to provide news programmes for holders of Regional Channel 3 licences (‘nominated 
news providers’). It was only possible to hold 20% of one nominated news provider, and each 
nominated  news  provider  was  only  permitted  to  own  up  to  50%  of  a  Regional  Channel  3 
licence (ie 50% of any company holding a Regional Channel 3 licence). The Broadcasting Act 
1996 then made further provision for all holders of Regional Channel 3 licences to, as far as 
possible, appoint the same (single) news provider (‘the appointed news provider’). 

The purpose of this provision was to ensure that high quality national and international news 
was carried across all Channel 3 regions at peak times by a single news provider. This was 
needed  because  Channel  3,  unlike  the  BBC,  was  not  a  single  network,  but  made  up  of  a 
number of Channel 3 regions under different ownership. By requiring all Regional Channel 3 
licence holders to select the same nominated news provider, from providers nominated for 
that purpose by the ITC, the rules guaranteed a nationwide competitor to the BBC’s news 
services. In the Government’s view, this competition served to underpin the impartiality of 
both services, guaranteeing plurality for viewers. Eventually the Communications Act 2003 
lifted  all  restrictions  on  the  ownership  of  nominated  news  providers,  while  retaining  the 
requirement for all Regional Channel 3 licence-holders to appoint the same nominated news 
provider.21

Digital TV services

3.8 

The Broadcasting Act 1996 introduced the licensing regime for digital TV and, at the same 
time, introduced certain ownership limits in relation to the number of digital licences that 
could be held. These rules were removed by the Communications Act 2003, consistent with 
its overall deregulatory approach, so there are now no explicit ownership rules in respect of 
digital TV services.22

PART C | The PressCSatellite and cable TV services

3.9 

The Broadcasting Act 1990 placed no restrictions on cable and satellite licences. This may 
well have been because these services were not subject to the same spectrum constraints 
as analogue services. The Act did place requirements on original programming in respect of 
direct satellite services (DBS) holding UK licenses for broadcasting on UK frequencies. No such 
requirement was placed on the holders of other satellite licenses (non-DBS).23 In practice, this 
meant that British Satellite Broadcasting was subject to this requirement, whilst Sky was not, 
giving a commercial advantage at the time to Sky in a market that proved not to be sufficient 
to support two satellite broadcasters.  

3.10  The  Broadcasting  Act  1990  also  placed  different  ownership  restrictions  on  DBS  and  non-
DBS satellite services. National newspapers could not hold more than a 20% stake in a DBS 
broadcasting  satellite  channel.  However,  no  such  restriction  was  placed  on  newspapers 
owning non-DBS licences. The Government of the day explained that this was because the 
number  of  DBS  licences  was  restricted  by  international  agreement  to  five,  whereas  the 
number of non-DBS licences was not restricted and was likely to grow significantly. This made 
ownership of one or more such channels less of a significant issue in plurality terms.24

Radio

Analogue local radio

3.11  The  Broadcasting  Act  1990  placed  an  upper  limit  on  ownership  of  20  analogue  local  radio 
licences.  In  addition  there  was  a  calculation  based  on  coverage  area  designed  to  ensure  a 
minimum of seven owners across the UK.  The Communications Act 2003 introduced a new 
system that would ensure at least three local owners in any area in addition to the BBC. This was 
subsequently changed to secure at least two, rather than three, local owners in addition to the 
BBC. Where there were only one or two local radio stations in an area all ownership restrictions 
were removed (subject to the local cross media ownership rule designed to ensure that there 
were not total local monopolies). Following a report from Ofcom in 2009, all local radio ownership 
rules were repealed by the Media Ownership (Radio and Cross Media) Order 2011.25

Analogue national radio

3.12  The  Broadcasting  Act  1990  placed  restrictions  on  one  person  holding  more  than  one 
of  the  three  national  analogue  commercial  radio  licences.    This  rule  was  removed  in  the 
Communications Act 2003.26

Digital radio

3.13  Under the Broadcasting Act 1996, a person was limited to one digital service licence or 15% of 
the total audience points (whichever was the higher) and was also disqualified from providing 
more than one non-simulcast local digital sound programme service on a single multiplex, 
unless there was another multiplex operating in the same geographical area. Following the 
Communications Act 2003, these rules were replaced by a new local points based regime; 
this mirrored the provisions of the analogue regime by placing a limit on digital radio licences 
of 55% of the points available in an area.27

Chapter 4 | Plurality CSpecific prohibitions on licence holding

3.14  There are restrictions on the holding of broadcasting licences by certain types or classes of 
owners. Historically there have been prohibitions on religious bodies holding broadcasting 
licenses. Over recent decades those restrictions have been significantly reduced, although 
religious bodies still cannot hold licences for Channel 3, Channel 5 or any national analogue 
radio  licence.28    The  Broadcasting  Act  1990  prevented  local  authorities  from  holding 
broadcasting licences. The Communications Act 2003 now allows local authorities to hold 
broadcast licences for information purposes, and puts in place safeguards to prevent this from 
being exploited for political purposes.29 The Broadcasting Act 1990 also prevented political 
parties from holding broadcasting licences (as there were concerns that they could not run a 
broadcasting company with sufficient impartiality). This restriction remains in place.30 

3.15  The  Broadcasting  Act  1990  additionally  prevented  advertising  agencies  from  holding 
broadcasting licences and this restriction has continued.31 The Broadcasting Act 1990 also 
introduced  some  foreign  ownership  restrictions  to  non-European  Economic  Area  (EEA) 
countries  (it  was  not  permitted  to  place  restrictions  on  EEA  companies  and  individuals), 
which were expanded upon by the Broadcasting Act 1996. Non-EEA companies could hold 
certain licences including for cable and satellite services. In 2002 the Government consulted 
on removing these restrictions and the matter was the subject of extensive debate. In the 
event, in circumstances fully described later in the Report,32 the Communications Act 2003 
did  remove  the  restrictions  and  there  is  now  no  restriction  on  foreign  ownership  of  any 
broadcasting licence, subject, of course, to other ownership restrictions.33

Cross media ownership

3.16  The position under the Broadcasting Act 1990 was:34 

(a)  National newspaper owners were tightly limited in their holdings in terrestrial TV and 
radio, and in domestic satellite broadcasters.35 Within each category they could hold up 
to 20% of one licence, and then up to 5% of any others. They were allowed full control of 
non-domestic satellite broadcasters “in order to encourage investment in an uncertain 
and high-risk enterprise”. (By 1996 there were no domestic satellite broadcasters and 
the largest non-domestic satellite broadcaster was BSkyB); 
Local newspaper owners were less tightly controlled, in being allowed to own regional 
TV or local radio broadcasters, provided there was no significant overlap between the 
licence area and the paper’s circulation area;

(b) 

(c)  National  TV  and  radio  (and  regional  Channel  3)  broadcasters  were  limited  to  a  20% 

(d) 

stake in national newspapers and non-domestic satellite licences; and
There were no cross-media restrictions on ownership cable services (other than that 
satellite providers could not own more than 20% of a terrestrial TV or National Radio 
licence).

PART C | The PressC3.17  The Communications Act 2003 revised these rules:

(a)  Retention of the national rule concerning cross-media ownership between newspapers 

and ITV. This was expressed as follows:
(i) 

no one controlling more than 20% of the national newspaper market may hold 
any licence for Channel 3;
no one controlling more than 20% of the national newspaper market may hold 
more than a 20% stake in any Channel 3 service; and

(ii) 

(iii)  a company may not own more than a 20% share in such a service if more than 
20% of its stock is in turn owned by a national newspaper proprietor with more 
than 20% of the market.

(b)  Retention of a parallel local rule: no one owning a regional Channel 3 licence may own 

(c) 

more than 20% of the local/regional newspaper market in the same region;
Stricter  application  of  the  local  radio  ownership  rules  where  potential  owners  had 
other media interests. The effect was to ensure that, in these cases, there would be a 
minimum of three media owners in each area across TV, newspapers and radio;

(d)  A local cross-media rule (the “local monopolies” rule) designed to ensure that there 

were no complete monopolies in areas with only one or two local radio stations;

All other cross-media ownership rules were repealed.

Review of ownership rules

3.18  The Communications Act 2003 requires Ofcom to review all media ownership rules at least 
every three years. Ofcom makes any recommendations for further reform to the Secretary 
of State, who can amend or remove rules by secondary legislation. The first review in 2006 
recommended no change.36 In its second report in November 2009,37 Ofcom concluded that 
that national “20/20” rule should be retained and that the local cross media ownership rules 
should  be  liberalised  so  that  the  only  restriction  remaining  would  be  on  ownership  of  all 
three of: local newspapers (with 50% plus local market share); a local radio station; and a 
regional Channel 3 licence.38 According to Ofcom:39

“this  liberalisation  will  increase  the  flexibility  of  local  media  to  respond  to  market 
pressures. Consumers still rely on television, radio and press for news, so going further 
to complete removal of the rules could reduce protections for plurality.”

3.19  On 8 July 2010, the Secretary of State asked Ofcom to revisit its advice on retaining the “local 
monopolies”  rule.  Ofcom replied  on  29 July  and  published  a fuller  version  of  the reply in 
August.40 It recognised that there had been some changes in circumstances since the original 
report but that a decision on whether to remove this one remaining local rule “is a matter of 
judgement and one which is rightly made by Government and Parliament”. Having considered

Chapter 4 | Plurality Cthe matter further, the Secretary of State concluded that the remaining rule should also be 
removed; this was given effect by the Media Ownership (Radio and Cross Media) Order 2011.41

3.20  The  Government’s  view  was  that  local  media  ownership  rules  (for  television,  radio  and 
newspapers) placed unnecessary limitations on ownership within commercial media; that the 
rules were no longer appropriate in a converging digital world; and that removing regulatory 
barriers would help established industries adapt to new environments. The deregulation of 
the local media ownership regulations now enables partnerships between local newspapers, 
radio and Channel 3 television stations to promote a strong and diverse local media industry.42 

Media plurality public interest test

3.21  The  process  by  which  the  media  plurality  public  interest  test  was  inserted  into  the 
Communications Bill, and the rationale behind it, is also fully outlined later in the Report.43 
These  provisions  mean  that  the  Secretary  of  State  can  ask  Ofcom  and,  if  necessary,  the 
Competition Commission to investigate any merger which could have a damaging effect on 
plurality, diversity or standards.44

3.22 

In applying the test the Secretary of State takes into account the need for:

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 

a sufficient plurality of persons with control of media enterprises serving any audience;
a wide range of high quality broadcasting that appeals to different tastes and interests; 
and
a genuine commitment to Ofcom’s standards code.

3.23  The  Government  produced  further  guidance  on  how  the  public  interest  test  would  be 
operated in practice. Partly due to Iobbying from industry, Ministers indicated that they were 
not minded to exercise these powers where media ownership rules continued to apply or 
where, before the passage of the Communications Act 2003, no media ownership restrictions 
applied.45

3.24  The request to Ofcom is triggered by an intervention notice issued by the Secretary of State 
which specifies a “media public interest consideration’’.46 A media public interest consideration 
is  any  consideration  which,  at  the  time  of  the  giving  of  the  European  intervention  notice 
concerned, is specified in s58(2A) to (2C) of the Enterprise Act 2002 or, in the opinion of the 
Secretary of State, is concerned with broadcasting or newspapers and ought to be specified 
in s58 of the Act (ie would need to be “finalised” by statutory instrument).

3.25  The currently recognised media public interest considerations are:47

(a) 

s58(2A): the need for accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion in 
newspapers;

46  depending on the type of merger, the power to issue such a notice may arise under sections 42(2), 59(2) or 67(2) of 
the Enterprise Act 2002
47  Communications Act 2003 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/Section/375 

188

PART C | The PressC(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

s58(2B): the need for, to the extent that it is reasonable and practicable, a sufficient 
plurality of views in newspapers in each market for newspapers in the UK or a part of 
the UK;
s58(2C)(a): the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in 
a particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality 
of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience;
s58(2C)(b): the need for the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range 
of broadcasting which (taken as a whole) is both of high quality and calculated to appeal 
to a wide variety of tastes and interests; and
s58(2C)(c):  the  need  for  persons  carrying  on  media  enterprises,  and  for  those  with 
control of such enterprises, to have a genuine commitment to the attainment in relation 
to broadcasting of the standards objectives set out in s319 of the Communications Act 
2003. These require, among other things, “that news included in television and radio 
services is reported with due impartiality and the impartiality requirements of s.320 are 
complied with” and that news is reported with “due accuracy”.

Paragraph 7.24 of the guidance issued by the DTI identifies the following as relevant to this 
question: previous compliance with Ofcom standards, the behaviour of the media owner’s 
other broadcasting enterprises, behaviour in other jurisdictions and compliance with other 
standards (including under self-regulatory regimes).48

3.26  An  enterprise  is  a  media  enterprise  if  it  consists  of  or  involves  broadcasting;49  but  where 
the public interest concern is that as set out in s58(2C)(a) and a merger involves only one 
broadcasting  company,  a  merger  is  still  a  media  merger  of  media  enterprises  if  the  other 
company is a newspaper enterprise.50

3.27  Where there has been an intervention notice, Ofcom is required to report to the Secretary 
of State on whether, having regard only to the public interest consideration specified in the 
intervention notice, it is or may be the case that the merger may be expected to operate 
against the public interest. It is then for the Secretary of State to determine whether or not 
the  merger  should  be  referred  to  the  Competition  Commission  for  further  review  and,  if 
necessary, consideration of remedies.51

3.28  There have only been two occasions on which the Secretary of State has issued an intervention 
notice in relation to a media merger. On both occasions, the public interest consideration 
was: “the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular 
area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with 
control of the media enterprises serving that audience”.52

3.29  The  first  of  these  occasions,  the  completed  acquisition  by  British  Sky  Broadcasting  Group 
plc (BSkyB) of a 17.9% stake in ITV, was a UK merger. Ofcom considered the plurality public 
interest  considerations  and  recommended  a  reference  to  the  Competition  Commission.53

Chapter 4 | Plurality CAt  the  same  time,  the  OFT  advised  that  the  transaction  was  a  merger  and  that  it  was  or 
may  be  the  case  that  the  merger  may  be  expected  to  result  in  a  substantial  lessening  of 
competition.54  The  Secretary  of  State  referred  the  case  to  the  Competition  Commission. 
The  Competition  Commission  considered  that  the  transaction  raised  competition  issues, 
but not plurality issues, and on its recommendation the Secretary of State required BSkyB 
to sell shares so as to reduce its holding to below 7.5%. The decision was appealed to the 
Competition Appeal Tribunal and to the Court of Appeal; the Court of Appeal upheld the 
Competition Commission’s decision.55

3.30  The second occasion, the proposed acquisition by News Corporation of the shares in BSkyB it 

did not already own, was an EC merger.56

4.  history of the newspaper ownership regime

Before the Communications Act 2003

4.1 

4.2 

DCMS has also very helpfully provided a history of the newspaper ownership regime.57 I draw 
heavily on it and gratefully acknowledge the work that was put into it. 

Since 1965 there has been a separate regime in place in respect of newspaper mergers. This 
was  first  introduced  by  then  Monopolies  and  Mergers  Act  1965,  following  the  Report  of 
the Royal Commission on the Press in 1962 (“the Shawcross report”). Shawcross concluded 
that control of the press was a matter of particular public sensitivity and that the increasing 
concentration  of  newspaper  ownership  in  too  few  hands  could  stifle  the  expression  of 
opinion and argument and distort the presentation of news. The Fair Trading Act 1973 (FTA) 
subjected most newspaper mergers to a stricter system of control than other mergers. The 
FTA required the Competition Commission (CC) to look at whether the transfer in question 
might be expected to operate against the public interest, taking into account all matters which 
appeared in the circumstances to be relevant. Any such transfer would be automatically void 
without the written consent of the Secretary of State.

4.3 

Proprietors had to obtain prior consent from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry 
(as was) before acquiring a newspaper (or newspaper assets) where the total paid-for daily 
circulation  of  the  newspapers  involved  was  500,000  or  more.  The  Secretary  of  State  was 
required  to  refer  newspaper  applications  to  the  CC  for  a  detailed  report  before  deciding 
whether or not to consent to the transfer. Exceptions to this rule meant that the Secretary of 
State:

(a) 

could consent to a transfer without a CC reference if he was satisfied that the newspaper 
was  not  economic  as  a  going  concern  and  that,  if  it  was  to  continue  as  a  separate 
newspaper, the case was urgent (s58(3)(a) of the FTA);

(b)  had to consent to a transfer without a CC reference if he was satisfied that the newspaper 
concerned  was  not  economic  as  a  going  concern  and  that  it  was  not  intended  to 
continue as a separate newspaper (s58(3)(b) of the FTA); and

PART C | The PressC(c) 

could consent to a transfer without a reference to the CC if he was satisfied that the 
newspaper being taken over had average daily sales of 50,000 or less (s58(4) of the 
FTA).

4.4 

Communications Act 2003
The Communications Act 2003 was designed to replace the FTA regime with a streamlined and 
less burdensome process that focused regulatory action on those few newspaper transfers 
that  appeared  to  raise  competition  or  plurality  concerns.  Under  the  Communications  Act 
2003 there is no longer a requirement for the Secretary of State’s prior consent to newspaper 
transfers. The new regime applies to all transfers that satisfy the jurisdictional criteria for 
mergers in the Enterprise Act (broadly speaking, the turnover of the body being acquired 
exceeds £70m or the merger would result in market-share of 25% or more), meaning that the 
smallest local newspapers were removed from regulation altogether.

4.5  Where a takeover or merger does not meet the jurisdictional criteria it is still possible for the 
Secretary of State to intervene under the special public interest regime; this applies in any 
case where the newspaper to be acquired has a 25% share of a market in a substantial part 
of the United Kingdom. 

4.6 

The Secretary of State retains the power to refer those cases that involve the public interest 
in plurality for wider investigation by the CC. The plurality public interest considerations are 
set out in s58 (2A) and (2B) of the Enterprise Act 2002 and cover:

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

accurate presentation of the news in newspapers;
free expression of opinion in newspapers; and
to the extent reasonable and practicable, a sufficient plurality of views in newspapers, 
in each market for newspapers in the UK or a part of the UK.

4.7  Where there has been a reference to the CC, it will make recommendations as to any remedies 
it deems appropriate to meet competition or plurality concerns. The final decision on any 
action  to  take  with  respect  to  plurality  issues  rests  with  the  Secretary  of  State.  However, 
the Secretary of State may seek the advice of Ofcom on the CC’s recommendations on the 
plurality  aspects  of  the  transfer.  He  can  disregard  the  competition  authorities’  proposed 
solutions to competition problems, but only where the plurality issues justify this course of 
action: the Secretary of State will decide overall on the basis of a public interest test that will 
take account of both plurality and competition.

Developments since 2003: local media assessment
The interim Digital Britain report included an invitation to the Office of Fair Trading to conduct 
a review of the local and regional media merger regime. The conclusions of this review were 
published  in  the  final  Digital  Britain  report.  The  OFT  broadly  considered  that  the  existing 
merger  framework  was  sufficiently  robust  and  flexible,  but  recommended  that  a  number 
of small changes would be advantageous. This included amending OFT guidance to ensure 
that, where a local media merger raised prima facie competition issues, the OFT would ask 
Ofcom  to  provide  a  Local  Media  Assessment  (LMA)  covering  relevant  factors  arising  from 
their understanding of media markets. The OFT subsequently revised their Jurisdictional and 
Procedural Merger Guidance accordingly.

Chapter 4 | Plurality C4.9 

Ofcom  has  to  date  conducted  one  Local  Media  Assessment,  concerning  the  proposed 
acquisition by Kent Messenger Group (KMG) of seven newspaper titles owned by Northcliffe 
Media. Ofcom provided its Local Media Assessment to the OFT on 2 September 2011. Ofcom 
considered that a merger could provide the opportunity to rationalise costs, maintain quality 
and investment, and provide a sounder commercial base from which to address long-term 
structural change, for example by expanding the availability of online and other digital local 
services. It also said that these potential benefits needed to be weighed against any potential 
customer harm resulting from reduced competition identified in the OFT’s overall assessment. 
Despite this, on 18 October 2011, the OFT referred the proposed merger to the Competition 
Commission, and the CC cancelled its inquiry after KMG announced it was abandoning the 
proposed acquisition as a result of the referral and some of the titles concerned were closed. 
According to KMG “The costs and time required for a full Competition Commission review 
would be completely unreasonable for a business of our size and for a deal of this scale.” 58

Introduction
In order to understand the present position in relation to press regulation, it is necessary to 
examine what has happened in the past. This chapter of the Report examines the content and 
context of the three Royal Commissions into the British Press undertaken since the Second 
World War, the Younger Report into Privacy of 1972, and the two reports of Sir David Calcutt 
QC into privacy and the press published in 1990 and 1993. Taken together, these form the 
formal public policy response to concerns with the press, press standards and the behaviour 
of journalists and others acting on behalf of newspapers and their employees, in the post-war 
period.

It  can  be  argued  that  the  findings  of  the  three  Royal  Commissions  as  well  as  the  reports 
of  Sir  David  Calcutt  not  only  help  to  elucidate  a  pattern  of  press  behaviour  that  remains 
pertinent to the work of this Inquiry, but also set out a series of attempts to find a solution to 
problems that remain broadly unchanged and unaddressed. Indeed, it has been contended 
by  some  witnesses  to  the  Inquiry  that  the  six  documents  that  form  the  backdrop  to  this 
chapter bear telling testament to a misplaced faith in the ability of the industry to develop 
and lead self-regulatory systems capable of offering appropriate real redress to those who 
have been wronged, and of constituting a sufficient solution to problems of unethical and 
unlawful behaviour in the newspaper industry. In this regard, the Media Standards Trust has 
said in its submission to the Inquiry:1

“The conclusion… that self-regulation on its own, without any greater independence 
or  enhanced  powers,  does  not  provide  adequate  protection  for  the  public  or  for 
journalists - is based in large part on an historical analysis of the continued failure 
of the various voluntary self-regulatory bodies that have existed since the first Royal 
Commission on the Press published its report in 1949.”

Some context
As has been emphasised in this Report on more than one occasion, the British press has a 
long held reputation for the vitality and quality of its journalism as well as the diversity of 
voices  with  which  it  speaks.  Certainly,  it  has  been  with  something  approaching  envy  that 
overseas commentators examining the British press both historically and today have been 
impressed by both its freedoms and the breadth and scope of its journalism. In this regard, it 
is worth highlighting the very large number of occasions that the Inquiry has been told with 
real pride by commentators, journalists, proprietors and politicians about the achievements 
of the British press and the valuable role it plays in the public life of the nation. 

For my part, I do not doubt that, at its best, British journalism is and has historically been 
world-beating: it has uncovered scandal, reported on significant events, and campaigned on 
issues of importance with both decency and integrity. Furthermore, it has been made very 
clear during the course of this Inquiry that journalism of the highest quality is not restricted 
only to a certain section of the press but is to be found across its many distinct and different

parts: not only in the broadsheets but also in the mid-market titles and the tabloids along 
with the regional and local press, both in print and now also in their online editions.

Before dealing with the analysis of historical responses to the culture and practices of the 
press, it is worth restating that the press does not exist in a vacuum. It is subject to other 
forces. Technological and societal changes have increased the pressures on what is and has 
historically been an intensely competitive market. The share which the newspaper industry 
holds of the wider communications market has been steadily eroded, first by radio and then 
the advent and growth of television. Television has moved from one initial offering by the BBC 
to the explosion of channels available through the introduction of satellite television services 
and,  further,  with  the  continuation  of  this  trend  through  the  rollout  of  digital  television. 
The loss of market share has been further exacerbated by the internet and the increasing 
availability of mixed media services through that medium. Overall, these forces have had an 
important role in shaping the culture, practices and ethics of the press over decades.

It should not be thought that the culture and practices that have given rise to the establishment 
of this Inquiry are in any way new, even if much of the technology which underpins  new 
developments is. Concerns as to the behaviour and practices of the press have been articulated 
by both private individuals and Governments throughout the twentieth century, and (in one 
form or another) very much earlier. Indeed, some of the practices and concerns that gave 
rise to the 1947 Royal Commission into the Press, and in particular those in relation to the 
breach of privacy of individuals, have been effectively repeated before this Inquiry. Thus, the 
historical review carried out in this chapter demonstrates a number of common themes; in 
particular, it reveals not merely consistent and similar complaints over the preceding decades, 
but also consistent and similar proposed solutions.

2.  The royal Commission into the press 1947
2.1 

Shortly  after  the  election  of  the  Labour  Government  in  May  1945,  the  National  Union  of 
Journalists (NUJ) passed a resolution which called for the new administration to establish 
an independent Commission to examine, among other things, structures of ownership and 
control  of  British  newspapers.  The  NUJ  resolution  reflected  growing  concern  about  the 
influence of a small group of newspaper publishers who had substantively increased their 
share of the national newspaper market in the inter-war period. The NUJ resolution also gave 
voice to other concerns and called for a Commission to investigate:2

“...with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and 
the  greatest  practicable  accuracy  in  the  presentation  of  news,  to  inquire  into  the 
control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the 
news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in 
control, and to make recommendations thereon.”

2.2 

The resolution led to the tabling of a motion in the House of Commons that repeated its 
central concerns. Advanced by members of Parliament who had either worked as journalists 
or were still employed as such, the motion also made an explicit connection between the 
growing  concentration  in  newspaper  ownership  by  a  small  number  of  proprietors  as  well 
as  the  substantial  increases  in  the  profitability  of  some  newspapers  since  the  conclusion

of hostilities, and a supposed decline in the quality of British journalism.3 The motion was 
passed by MPs on the 29 October 1946. It read:4

“That, having regard to the increasing public concern at the growth of monopolistic 
tendencies  in  the  control  of  the  Press  and  with  the  object  of  furthering  the  free 
expression  of  opinion  through  the  Press  and  the  greatest  practicable  accuracy  in 
the presentation of news this House considers that a Royal Commission should be 
appointed to inquire into the finance, control, management and ownership of the 
Press.”

In part, the concerns articulated in the resolution of the NUJ and the Parliamentary motion 
reflected understandable public disquiet at a return to business as usual by the newspaper 
industry after the war years (which had entailed strict Government control of all content, 
print as well as the means of distribution). The reversion to a peacetime modus operandi 
also  heralded  the  return,  after  the  quiescence  of  the  war  years,  of  a  number  of  sharper 
journalistic practices increasingly unpalatable to the public at large. These were manifest to 
differing degrees in accusations of inaccuracy and political bias on the one hand and alarm at 
the intrusion of journalists into the private lives of individuals on the other.5 

However,  public  indignation  at  such  behaviour  was  not  new;  the  culture  and  practices  of 
some parts of the press had been noted as a matter of concern by the immediate pre-war 
Government-appointed  Political  and  Economic  Planning  (PEP)  group  which,  in  1938,  had 
formulated  the  first  significant  proposal  for  formal  self-regulation  of  the  press.6  Among 
other things, the PEP group’s final report argued for the establishment of a voluntary Press 
Tribunal led by an independent Chairman and supported by a panel of experts drawn from 
the newspaper industry. This, the report suggested, should consider and mediate complaints 
made by members of the public about the press. The outbreak of war drew an end to any 
further work to achieve this end.

The Commission was granted a broad remit by the Government of Clement Atlee and was 
charged with seeking answers to a number of questions that went further than the concerns 
that have been outlined above. The Government asked that the Commission investigate:7, 8
•  “Whether the degree of concentration of ownership of newspapers, periodicals, and 

news agencies at present exists;

•  Whether there is a tendency towards further concentration;
•  Whether  such  concentration  as  exists  is  on  balance  disadvantageous  to  the  free 

expression of opinion or the accurate presentation of news;

•  Whether any other factors in the control, management or ownership of the Press or of 
the news agencies, or any external influences operating on those concerned in control, 
management or ownership, militate against this freedom and accuracy; and

free expression of opinion through the Press and the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news, to 
inquire into the control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the news agencies, 
including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, and to make recommendations thereon”,

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundD•  How this freedom and accuracy may best be promoted.”

2.6  When  the  Royal  Commission  reported  in  1949, it  made  a  number  of  damning  findings.  It 
found that there had been “a progressive decline in the calibre of editors and in the quality of 
British journalism” which, it argued, if not addressed would undermine not only the freedom 
of the press itself, but also the welfare of the country at large. The Commission recommended 
that a system of self-regulation should be established, built around a “General Council of the 
Press”. The Commission was unambiguous in its consideration of statutory controls which, it 
argued, would unacceptably restrict the freedoms of the press. It said that it was necessary:9

2.7 

2.8 

“to safeguard the freedom of the press; to encourage the growth of a sense of public 
responsibility and public service amongst all engaged in the profession of journalism 
[...]; and to further the efficiency of the profession and the well being of those who 
practiced it.”

The Royal Commission hoped that the proposed General Press Council would function both 
as a guarantor of the “freedom and prestige of the Press”, by representing the interests of the 
newspaper industry through a single, unified voice as well as a brake on poor and unethical 
journalistic practices. In so doing the Royal Commission made a fundamental statement on 
the nature of the relationship between the state of the press and the health of the nation as a 
whole, suggesting a correlation between the ownership structures of the newspaper industry 
and the incidence of inaccurate reporting and poor journalism. Significantly too, the Royal 
Commission’s  report  recognised  that,  as  a  consequence  of  technological  and  commercial 
changes,  the  ability  of  newspapers  to  disseminate  “to  the  public  a  mass  of  information 
on  subjects  as  complicated  as  they  are  important”  had  increased,  but  there  had  been  no 
commensurate increase in journalism fitting or appropriate to such purpose.10

The Report of the Royal Commission made a number of recommendations, some of which 
added important detail to the central proposal of the formation of this ‘General Council’. For 
instance, the Commission recommended that the Press Council be made up of 25 members, 
a proportion of whom (some 20%) would be appointed from outside the industry and would 
ensure  that  lay  interests  were  adequately  represented.  The  Commission’s  Report  also  set 
out what Sir William David Ross and his fellow commissioners regarded as the necessary and 
non-negotiable elements of an effective regulatory regime for the British press. These were: a 
code of conduct; powers to adjudicate and rule on complaints, including those received from 
third parties as much as from individuals directly affected, and powers to impose sanctions 
where appropriate. It was intended by the Commission that the Press Council should have 
sufficient powers to maintain press standards and where appropriate to impose sanctions for 
poor conduct:11 

“It  should  have  the  right  to  consider  any  complaints  which  it  may  receive  about 
the  conduct  of  the  Press  or  of  any  persons  towards  the  Press,  to  deal  with  these 
complaints in whatever manner may seem to it practicable and appropriate, and to 
include in an annual report a statement of any action taken.”

2.9 

It is clear from the recommendations made by the Royal Commission that it intended that the 
Press Council should have a broad remit, encompassing a number of potentially problematic 
and conflicting functions; this would include being a champion of press freedom as well as 
a defender of the rights of members of the public who might have been mistreated by the

Part D | StandardsDpress.  In  addition  the  Royal  Commission  proposed  that  the  General  Council  of  the  Press 
should  have  appropriate  powers  to  monitor  and  rule  on  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the 
employment of journalists and other newspaper workers, whilst also promoting the interests 
of consumers and conducting research into the long-term social and economic impacts of the 
print industry. The Commission was clear; its proposals were not intended “to safeguard its 
own liberty” but to “save the press from itself.” 12

2.10  Although Parliament unconditionally accepted the recommendations of the Commission, the 
industry response to them was slow and much wrangling and negotiation followed. Indeed, 
it has been convincingly argued by some commentators that such progress was only made as 
a consequence of the real threat of statutory regulation.13

2.11  That came about in this way. The initial industry response of the press to the Report of the 
Royal Commission found little favour with the then Government. That response was seen 
as concentrating too much power in the hands of already powerful newspaper proprietors, 
and paying too little heed to many of the recommendations contained in the report. The NUJ 
also declared the newspaper industry’s proposals to be unacceptable to the Union and its 
members.14 

2.12  To deal with what appeared to be a palpable lack of progress and refusal on the part of the 
newspaper industry to grapple with the fundamental criticisms and concerns at the heart of 
the Royal Commission’s report, in November 1952 the Labour backbench MP, CJ Simmons, 
with  the  backing  of  a  number  of  members  of  the  Shadow  Cabinet,  introduced  a  Private 
Member’s Bill. This Bill was intended to establish a Press Council in statute. The threat of 
statutory regulation quickly persuaded newspaper publishers to come to an agreement that 
was deemed satisfactory to the Conservative Government, which then took action to prevent 
a second reading of the Bill.15

2.13  When it was eventually established in 1953, the General Council of the Press, as had been 
fashioned by the industry and endorsed by the Conservative Government, was substantially 
different from the proposals that had been recommended by the Royal Commission. In many 
respects, the changes which had been made to the structures and functions of the nascent 
Press Council were to the benefit of the industry and not to those who complained of having 
been  the  victims  of  press  mistreatment.  Significantly,  proposals  for  lay  representation  on 
the  Press  Council,  including  the  appointment  of  Chairman  from  outside  the  industry,  had 
been dropped. Further, the recommendation that the Press Council be able to investigate 
and make findings on complaints brought by members of the public was changed so that, 
in most circumstances, only complaints by persons affected by stories would be accepted; 
third party complaints would be entertained on a discretionary basis and exceptionally. Other 
recommendations relating to the promotion of standards and the employment conditions 
of journalists and other newspaper employees were also omitted from the final proposals 
brought forward by the industry.16

2.14  The Media Standards Trust has noted in its submission to the Inquiry the ‘prescience’ of the 
final contribution made by CJ Simmons to the Parliamentary debates on the establishment 
the Press Council, in which he said:17

this Bill.”

Committee	into	privacy	
The  General  Council  of  the  Press  was  neither  the  body  nor  the  panacea  that  the  Royal 
Commission had intended. From the outset it was the subject of criticism, particularly from 
those who thought themselves the victims of press mistreatment. It was seen as self-serving 
and concerned more with defending the interests of journalists and newspaper editors than 
in addressing the many issues identified by the first Royal Commission on the press. In 1961 
a second Royal Commission was established:

“...to examine the economic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of 
newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom.” 

Lord Shawcross, a former Labour Attorney General and then President of the Board of Trade, 
later becoming a cross-bench peer, was appointed Chairman of the second Royal Commission. 
Lord Shawcross was a passionate defender of press freedoms and had spoken publicly on the 
subject on a number of occasions. He brought a formidable intellect to the task as well as a 
reputation for gravitas and forensic analysis achieved as Chief UK Counsel for the Prosecution 
in the post-war Nuremberg trials. 

The establishment of a second Royal Commission on the press was prompted in part by the 
closure of a number of national and provincial newspapers which had led to a further, and to 
some, worrying concentration in the ownership of newspaper titles. Its primary purpose was 
to look at the costs of production, printing and distribution as well as at the nascent impact of 
television on readership and advertising revenues, and to consider whether these factors had 
affected the diversity of ownership and control. The terms of reference to the Commission 
explained it thus:18

“...to examine the economic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of 
newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom.”

The  Commission  was  not  primarily  concerned  with  the  performance  of  the  press  or  with 
questions of ethical behaviour, and indeed its terms of reference made no express reference 
to either of these matters. But its very establishment reflected political and public concern 
at the steady build up of complaint, as well as public disapproval, at press behaviour. Some 
contemporary commentators sought to explain this further decline in standards through the 
prism of increased competition for circulation. Others called into question the effectiveness 
of the overall system of self-regulation through the General Council of the Press, decrying its 
inability to put an end to press intrusion into the private lives of individuals.19 It is a matter of 
some significance that Lord Shawcross commented on the failure to heed the lessons of the 
first Royal Commission:20

“[h]ad they been carried out much of our own inquiry might have been unnecessary”.

3.8 

The  Shawcross  Commission  published  its  findings  in  September  1962.  The  Commission 
levelled substantial criticism at the General Council of the Press for, in particular, its failure 
to  implement  many  of  the  recommendations  made  by  the  first  Royal  Commission  on  the 
press.  These  specifically  included  those  recommendations  relating  to  the  monitoring  and 
enforcement of standards, the involvement of lay representatives on the Council and its failure 
to heed recommendations relating to the monitoring of levels of newspaper ownership.

The Shawcross Commission clearly identified those issues that it deemed had led to a decline 
in press standards, and it called for an improvement in the performance of the General Council 
of the Press. However, the solutions it proposed were little different from those articulated 
by the first Royal Commission in 1949. It recognised the desirability of a voluntary system of 
self-regulation for the press, but made clear that any such system of regulation would need to 
be built around an effective and credible body rather than the General Council of the Press as 
it was then constituted. It recommended that the industry should be given two years to bring 
forward, develop and implement appropriate plans but, should these not be forthcoming, 
recommended that the Government should introduce the legislation necessary to establish a 
Press Council in statute, with powers equivalent to those recommended originally by the first 
Royal Commission in 1949. Lord Shawcross said at the time:21 

“If... the Press is not willing to invest the Council with the necessary authority and to 
contribute the necessary finance the case for a statutory body with definite powers 
and the right to levy the industry is a clear one”.

Anxious  at  the  potential  threat  of  statutory  legislation,  the  industry  response  to  the 
recommendations of the second Royal Commission was rather swifter than had been the 
case following the first Royal Commission. The General Council of the Press was reformed 
as  the  Press  Council.  For  the  first  time  it  included  lay  representation  on  its  board.  The 
newly formed Press Council also made amendments to its constitution to reflect the wider 
recommendations made by the Commission. Clauses that were no longer regarded as relevant 
to its role and remit were removed and, in particular, a new clause was introduced in relation 
to the consideration of complaints about the press.22 This empowered the Press Council to 
deal with them “in whatever manner might seem practical and appropriate”.23 The reformed 
Press Council also took a more proactive approach to the consideration of some of the most 
significant challenges facing the press and published guidance on contempt of court, privacy 
and defamation.

These reforms, however, were not universally well-received. Questions were asked almost 
immediately about the ability of the Press Council to regulate the actions and conduct of 
newspapers. These had altered little over time, and the press continued to push at the boundaries 
of  what  was  considered  acceptable  journalism.  Coverage  of  the  Profumo  scandal  and,  in  
particular,  the  Sun’s  exclusive  interview  with  Christine  Keeler,  as  well  as  the  vilification  of 
the  child-killer  Mary  Bell,  by  turns  titivated,  entranced  and  horrified  the  public.  Further, 
allegations of payments for stories relating to the Profumo affair, as well as to witnesses in 
the case of the Moors Murders, undermined confidence in the efficacy of the Press Council 
as the regulatory body for the press.24 Perhaps unsurprisingly, by the end of the decade there 
were calls for a further Royal Commission on the press as well as an inquiry into the workings

the press [rather] than as a watchdog for the public”.25

3.9 

The  introduction  of  a  Private  Members  Bill  on  privacy  forced  the  hand  of  the  Wilson 
Government,  and  in  1970  a  new  Committee  looking,  once  again,  at  the  behaviour  of  the 
press was constituted.

The Younger Committee

3.10  The  Committee  on  Privacy,  chaired  by  Sir  Kenneth  Younger,  was  established  to  examine 
a  number  of  issues  relating  to  the  personal  privacy,  including  the  responses  of  the  Press 
Council to alleged breaches of privacy in the press. Sir Kenneth Younger was a barrister by 
training and former Labour Party politician who had served as a junior Home Office Minister 
in  the  Government  of  Clement  Atlee.  After  leaving  Parliament  in  1957,  Sir  Kenneth  had 
campaigned for progressive political reform with regard to a number of social issues including 
the legalisation of homosexuality and reform of prison conditions.

3.11  Published in July 1972, the report of the Younger Committee on privacy was highly critical of 
the Press Council and its seeming inability to command the confidence of the British public. 
The Committee suggested a causal link between the level of lay representation on the Press 
Council and the overall credibility of that organisation in the public mind. The Commission 
duly  recommended  that  the  Press  Council  increase  the  representation  of  lay  members;  it 
also  recommended  that  steps  be  taken  to  ensure  the  independence  of  lay  appointments 
because, in its view, the process of appointment was both opaque and too readily open to 
influence  from  the industry.26  Of  the recommendations  made by the Younger Committee, 
perhaps  the  most  significant  related  to  the  publication  of  Press  Council  adjudications  by 
newspapers.  The  Younger  Committee  suggested  that  where  an  adverse  adjudication  had 
been issued by the Council, it should be given similar prominence to that given to the original 
article.27 The Younger Committee also recommended that the Council make efforts to codify 
its adjudications on privacy and build up a body of case law understood by the industry.28 

3.12 

It is perhaps indicative of the prevailing mood that the Committee did not unanimously agree 
the recommendations made in the final report. However, a minority of the commissioners 
who worked together with Sir Kenneth, did not believe the recommendations to be sufficiently 
far-reaching, and a minority report was published which recommended among other things 
a general law of privacy to provide individuals with proper protection from unjustified press 
intrusion.29 

3.13  The  reforms  of  the  Press  Council,  which  were  finally  implemented  in  July  1973,  did  not 
encompass  the  most  significant  of  the  recommendations  made  in  the  Younger  Report.  In 
particular,  recommendations  on  the  prominence  of  adjudications  and  the  codification  of 
rulings had been dropped. Lay membership on the Press Council was increased by four to ten, 
which was exactly half the number of industry representatives. Begrudgingly accepting the 
Committee’s recommendation, the Chairman of the Press Council, Lord Pearce, noted that the 
Younger Report had provided ‘no evidence’ to support the conclusions it made linking public

the Complaints Committee.30 

3.14  Following  the  publication  of  the  Younger  Report,  public  criticism  of  the  Press  Council, 
characterised by Lord Pearce as ‘assaults on the principle of self-regulation,’ became more 
commonplace.31 Certainly, the tensions between the regulator, the regulated and the public 
were made more acute by the political and social tensions between the Government, the 
trade  unions  and  the  industry  more  broadly,  and  did  little  to  address  the  failings,  both 
perceived and actual, of the Press Council. Indeed, the performance of the Press Council was 
regarded by the Government of the day as so inadequate that, within a year of publication of 
Sir Kenneth Younger’s report, not only was a third Royal Commission on the Press established, 
but it was given an express remit to examine in detail “the responsibilities, constitution and 
functioning of the Press Council.” 32

4.  The royal Commission of 1974
4.1 

The  Third  Royal  Commission  on  the  Press  was  established  on  7  March  1974  under  the 
Chairmanship  of  Professor  Oliver  (later  Lord)  MacGregor,  then  a  leading  academic  in  the 
field of socio-legal studies and medical sociology and, immediately before his appointment, a 
fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. Much later, he was appointed first Chairman of the Press 
Complaints Commission. 

4.2 

The MacGregor Commission was constituted not only in the context of ongoing discussions 
on  the  recommendations  of  the  Younger  Report  on  privacy  but  also  against  a  continuing 
backdrop of concern at the behaviour of journalists and the press more widely. Public and 
political frustration was also growing at the apparent inability of the Press Council to curb 
the worst excess of such behaviour or to provide sufficient redress to those who had been 
wronged  by  the  press.  The  MacGregor  Commission  was  granted  a  broad  remit  and  was 
invited to:33 

“...inquire into the factors affecting the maintenance of the independence, diversity 
and  editorial  standards  of  newspapers  and  periodicals  and  the  public  freedom  of 
choice of newspapers and periodicals, nationally, regionally and locally.”

4.3  When it reported in 1977, the McGregor Commission sought to explain the real difficulties it 
had faced in reaching its recommendations. The Commission expressed concern that there 
was no real public or political consensus on the role of press in British society. It recognised 
that the press should not be subject to state control but it refused to advocate a press that 
was subject only to the unregulated forces of the market and the pursuit of profit.34 Although 
undecided  on  the  most  suitable  form  of  regulation  for  the  press,  the  Commission  was 
unequivocal in its criticism of the Press Council both as a regulator of press standards and as 
able to provide appropriate means of redress. It recommended wholesale changes to both 
the structure and functions of the Press Council.

4.4 

The  Commission’s  proposals  for  reform  of  the  Press  Council  included  a  reiteration  of  the 
dormant recommendations of the first and second Royal Commissions as to the prominence

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundDand location of adjudications. Lord MacGregor’s Commission, in line with the previous Royal 
Commissions and the Younger Commission, also proposed that the question of confidence in 
the Press Council should be addressed through an increase in the number of lay representatives 
and the appointment of a lay Chairman. It also recommended that the Press Council should 
seek to curb the worst excesses of the press through the development and implementation 
of a written code of conduct. The Commission’s report noted:35 

“...it  is  unhappily  certain  that  the  Council  has  so  far  failed  to  persuade  the 
knowledgeable public that it deals satisfactorily with complaints against newspapers”.

4.5 

The MacGregor Commission also made recommendations intended to effect a fundamental 
shift in the treatment and handling by the Press Council of complaints made by members of 
the public. It proposed that the Press Council should not only act as mediator and arbitrator of 
complaints but should also actively seek, where appropriate, to secure the swift publication of 
adjudications, where necessary on the front page. The MacGregor Commission also entered 
new terrain, as its recommendations included:36

“The creation of a Conciliator, drawn from the staff of the Council, to propose remedies 
between complainants and newspapers:

•  The  extension  of  the  Council’s  doctrine  of  right  of  reply,  and  to  uphold  a 
newspaper’s  making  space  available  to  those  it  has  criticised  inaccurately 
(although the Commission rejected the introduction of a legal right of reply 
on the principle that the press should not be subject to different laws than 
ordinary citizens);

•  The  power  to  investigate  the  conduct  of  the  press  without  waiting  for  a 
formal complaint; to introduce the practice of undertaking wider reviews of 
publications and journalists involved in disputes;

•  The  amendment  of  the  Council’s  existing  position  on  accuracy  and  bias,  so 

that inaccuracy should be prima facie evidence for upholding a complaint;

•  The  Chairman’s  role  to  be  extended  to  chairmanship  of  the  Appointments 

Commission; and

•  That the Council should accept recommendations for lay appointments from 

any source.”

4.6 

In line with the approach of the Second Royal Commission, the final report of the MacGregor 
Commission suggested that if the response of the industry and Press Council was insufficient 
to address ongoing concerns as to press conduct and restore confidence in the Press Council, 
then a statutory solution might need to be sought.37 That said, Professor MacGregor remained 
hopeful that such measures would not be necessary. The conclusion to its report set out its 
aspiration and belief that:38

“...these recommendations will be accepted and acted on by the Press Council, and 
that it will fulfil the hopes that were held for it in 1949.”

Part D | StandardsD4.7 

In  a  yet  further  parallel  to  the  Younger  Review,  the  MacGregor  Commission  published  a 
minority report, its adherents taking the line that more was needed to modify the culture, 
practices and ethics of the press.39 

4.8  Much as the publication of the MacGregor Report in 1977 had mirrored the publication of 
the Shawcross  report in  1962, there were many similarities  between the reactions  of  the 
Press  Council  and  the  industry  to  the  two  sets  of  recommendations.  The  Press  Council 
rejected  the  most  significant  recommendations  of  the  MacGregor  Commission,  arguing 
that  they  amounted  to  an  unnecessary  restraint  on  the  press  and  muzzled  freedom  of 
expression, despite widespread and very public calls for meaningful reform. In all, five out 
of twelve of the MacGregor Commission’s recommendations for reform of the Press Council 
were explicitly rejected, including the recommendation for a written Code of Conduct, and 
a  number  of  others  were  de  facto  ignored.40  Furthermore,  where  the  call  for  reform  was 
heeded and changes implemented, that implementation was partial and incomplete. As the 
Media Standards Trust has fairly pointed out, this repeated the:41 

“...previous outcomes of 1953, 1963 and 1973 (when the recommendations of the 
first two Royal Commissions and the Younger Report were implemented).”

4.9 

Of the recommendations made by the MacGregor Commission in relation to the Press Council, 
only those relating to lay representation, the appointment of a Conciliator and to the seeking 
of nominations ‘from any source’ were adopted in full. 

4.10  Yet although  the reaction  of  the industry was predictably  obstructive, the reaction  of  the 
public was different. Whereas the newspaper industry had criticised the recommendations 
made  by  Professor  MacGregor  because  of  the  restrictions  they  believed  the  proposals 
would, if implemented, have placed not only on freedom of speech but also on the ability 
of journalists to hold the rich and powerful to account, public criticism of the report focused 
on the perceived weakness of its proposals, particularly in relation to the Press Council. In a 
curious twist of fate, contemporary commentators also suggested that there were unintended 
consequences  to  the  publication  of  the  MacGregor  report,  namely  that  the  extent  of  the 
criticism of the Council in the report weakened it still further and “did little to improve the 
long-term credibility of that body.” 42 

5.	 The	first	report	of	Sir	David	Calcutt	QC
5.1 

It is clear that neither the MacGregor Commission nor the limited and begrudging response 
of  the  industry  to  its  recommendations  did  much  to  stem  the  increasingly  growing  sense 
that self-regulation of the press through the offices of the Press Council was not an effective 
means of limiting harmful press behaviour. Rather, they fostered a polarisation of the debate 
on the role of the press in British society and the most effective means of regulating what 
many  believed  to  be  the  most  harmful  aspects  of  press  behaviour.  Indeed,  the  period 
between the publication of the report of the third Royal Commission and the formation of 
the Press Complaints Committee in 1990 (following the publication of the first of the reviews 
of the press by Sir David Calcutt) witnessed some of the most egregious examples of press

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundDmisconduct. These included allegations of cheque book journalism in relation to the Yorkshire 
Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, defamatory allegations made in The Sun about the singer, Elton John 
(which led to the award of record damages for libel in 1987), the coverage of the television 
presenter  Russell  Harty’s  illness  and  subsequent  death  in  1988,  and  the  coverage  of  the 
alleged behaviour of Liverpool football fans during the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Some 
of these examples of breaches of privacy and defamatory reporting became stories in their 
own right. The growing list of high-profile incidents involving harmful press behaviour tested 
public and Parliamentary support for the Press Council and led to a ‘crescendo’ of criticism.43

The corollary to this was the continued erosion of public support for voluntary self-regulation. 
It should not be doubted that contemporaneous arguments about journalistic freedoms and 
the most effective means of regulating the British press were amplified through the wider 
travails and industrial disputes that afflicted the industry during this period. These paralleled 
a growing ideological divide in British politics. Back in 1974, the Labour Party had published 
a report entitled The People and the Media which set out its thinking on the British media 
and communications markets. It proposed that a joint regulatory code should be developed 
for  both  broadcasting  and  the  press,  and  that  public  confidence  in  the  regulator  should 
be fostered through greater transparency, regular public review of that body and a legally 
enforceable right of reply.44 The report also considered the state of the press market and, 
perhaps unsurprisingly for a document produced by a political party which was not always 
favourably characterised in press reporting, bemoaned a lack of accountability and bias in the 
press. More significantly, The People and the Media was also strongly critical of the existing 
system of self-regulation through the Press Council;  whilst the Governments of Harold Wilson 
and James Callaghan did little to change the system of self-regulation for the press, the report 
marked an fundamental shift in political support for the Press Council, which had previously 
benefited from the tacit support of both the Labour and the Conservative Parties. 

The Labour Party was certainly not alone in its criticism of the Press Council. The Campaign 
for  Press  Freedom  (which  would  later  be  re-constituted  as  the  Campaign  for  Press  and 
Broadcasting Freedom (CPF)) also advocated a complete overhaul of regulation of the press. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly for an organisation that had its roots in the wider Labour movement, 
the CPF pointed to what it regarded as unnecessary and destructive hostility directed at the 
trade unions by newspaper proprietors. The CPF also sought to lay the blame for the lack of real 
and meaningful reform at the door of the Press Council and the system of self-regulation itself. 

So concerned was the CPF at the perceived injustices of the existing system that it established 
its own Inquiry into the Press Council and matters relating to it. When it was finally published in 
1983, the CPF report (known as the Robertson Report on the Press Council after its Chairman 
Geoffrey Robertson). The Robertson Report was unsurprisingly critical of the performance of 
the Press Council, but recommended nevertheless that the organisation be granted one final 
opportunity to reform itself and demonstrate its efficacy as a regulator.

The conclusions of the report were unambiguous about what such reforms should entail. 
It recommended substantive changes to the Press Council and indeed to the existing law. 
Recommendations  for  reform  of  the  Press  Council  included  the  further  and  oft  repeated 
call  for  the  development  of  a  published  code  of  conduct,  auditing  powers  to  ensure  the 
maintenance of high standards, as well as powers, backed by contract, to direct prominent 
publication of corrections.45 The Robertson Report also recommended that the Press Council 
be given responsibility for the training and professional development of journalists. However,

this report also went much further in its recommendations than just proposals for the reform 
of  the  Press  Council.  It  also  recommended  substantive  legislative  change.  Proposals  put 
forward by the CPF included legislation to establish a statutory press ombudsman, to provide 
a defence in law for investigative journalism, a Freedom of Information Act and changes to 
the laws on libel and contempt.46

Reference has already been made to examples of press misconduct in the 1980s, but it would 
be  incorrect  to  suggest  that  the  Press  Council  was  always  silent  in  these  circumstances. 
Indeed,  under  the  leadership  of  its  final  Chairman  Sir  Louis  Blom-Cooper  QC,  the  Press 
Council made significant efforts better to represent ordinary people and the victims of press 
mistreatment.47 However, there is little evidence to suggest that such rulings were respected 
or  observed  by  the  industry.  Indeed,  in  material  submitted  by  Sir  Louis  to  the  Inquiry,  he 
has made clear his belief that the Press Council ultimately failed because its rulings were 
routinely, though not always, traduced and undermined in the pages of newspapers, thereby 
only serving to undermine public confidence in that body.48 

The  perceived  inability  of  the  Press  Council  to  take  credible  and  effective  action  in  these 
cases of press mistreatment further damaged its reputation. Increasingly, it was regarded as 
ineffective both as a regulator of press conduct and as a means of redress for those who had 
suffered harm. Consequent opprobrium at the Press Council was not restricted to those who 
were the victims of press misconduct, but also extended to policy makers and to some of 
those involved in the industry. Already in 1980, the NUJ had withdrawn its membership from 
the Press Council on the grounds that it was not only incapable of internal reform but also 
was not able effectively to improve the behaviour of the press.

Parliamentary concern at the behaviour of some parts of the press was such that in 1989 
two  Private  Members’  Bills  were  put  before  Parliament.  These  were  intended  to  address 
the  intrusive  practices  conducted  by  some  journalists  and  the  lack  of  redress  available 
to those who had been the victims of them. The first of the two Bills was laid before the 
House of Commons by a Conservative MP, John Browne. His Bill proposed the introduction 
of a privacy tort, envisaged as a means of helping to protect individuals from unwarranted 
intrusion by the press. The second such Bill was introduced by Tony Worthington, a Labour 
MP. This proposed the creation of a statutory Press Commission Appeal Tribunal with legally 
enforceable  sanctions.  Introducing  his  Bill  to  Parliament,  Mr  Worthington  expressed  the 
hope that it would improve access to redress for those who had been the victims of press 
mistreatment and speed up the process of dealing with complaints.

These  Private  Members’  Bills  were  not  the  only  attempts  by  Parliamentarians  to  tackle 
perceived press wrong-doing and the seeming inability of the Press Council to police press 
excesses effectively, although they were the last before the eventual appointment of Sir David 
Calcutt in 1989. For example:49
•  In June 1981 the Labour MP, Frank Allaun, presented a Bill ‘to give members of the 
public the right to reply to allegations made against them in the press, or on radio or 
television’. In December 1982, Allaun introduced a second right of reply Bill to the 
House of Commons.

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundD•  In January 1982, the Conservative MP, Teddy Taylor, asked the Attorney General to 
review the remedies available ‘to individuals, groups and organisations in the event of 
newspapers or the broadcasting media publicising inaccurate or misleading reports, 
and legal remedies available to newspapers and broadcasters in the event of industrial 
action looking to influence their content.’ 

•  In  June  1984,  Alfred  Dubs  MP  (Labour)  pressed  unsuccessfully  for  a  Bill  to  make 
newspapers  declare  payments  to  non-regular  contributors.  The  Labour  MP  Austin 
Mitchell also introduced a Bill requiring a right of reply. 

•  In 1987 a number of yet further attempts were made to introduce legislation to curb the 
worst excesses of press misbehaviour. These included the movement of a debate in the 
House of Lords by the Labour Peer, Lord Longford, on ‘Tabloid press: moral standards’, 
the  introduction  of  an  Unfair  Reporting  and  Right  of  Reply  Bill  by  the  Labour  MP,   
Ann Clywd, and the introduction of a Right of Privacy Bill by the Conservative MP, Bill Cash.

5.10  The Government responded to this continual build-up of pressure for both the reform of the 
Press Council and the introduction of effective curbs on the worst excesses of press practice 
by appointing a Departmental Committee, chaired by Sir David Calcutt QC, to investigate the 
matter. Sir David was asked:50

“...to consider what measures (whether legislative or otherwise) are needed to give 
further protection to individual privacy from the activities of the press and improve 
recourse against the press for the individual citizen.”

5.11  Sir David published his report on Privacy and Related Matters in June 1990. It is clear from the 
content of the report that the members of the Committee considered its remit to go beyond 
a limited discussion of privacy and encompass the existing system of press regulation.51 The 
final report was highly critical of the Press Council and set out in clear terms the failings of 
that organisation. These included: its ineffectiveness as an adjudicator; the lack of confidence 
in its independence from the newspaper industry; its tendency to reject large numbers of 
complaints; the lack of clarity in its selection and categorisation of complaints; the time taken 
to resolve contested cases; and the lack of effective sanctions in instances of proven breach.52

5.12  However, contrary to the expectations of a number of contemporary commentators, Sir David 
Calcutt’s first report did not advocate the introduction of statutory controls for the press. 
Rather, it recommended that the Press Council should be abolished and replaced with a new 
self-regulatory organisation; the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The report argued that 
the press be given:53

“...one  final  chance  to  prove  that  voluntary  self-regulation  can  be  made  to  work. 
However, we do not consider that the Press Council, even if reformed as proposed 
in its internal review, should be kept as part of the system. We therefore recommend 
that the Press Council should be disbanded and replaced by a new body, specifically 
charged  with  adjudicating  on  complaints  of  press  malpractice.  This  body  must  be 
seen to be authoritative, independent and impartial. It must also have jurisdiction 
over the press as a whole, must be adequately funded and must provide a means 
of  seeking  to  prevent  publication  of  intrusive  material.  We  consider  it  particularly

called the Press Complaints Commission.”

5.13  The report recommended that this new body should deal with the numerous and substantial 
concerns that had been raised around the behaviour of some parts of the press. In contrast 
to  the  three  Royal  Commissions,  the  Calcutt  Committee  did  not  make  a  large  number  of 
recommendations for specific reforms. Rather, it set out a framework of measures that the 
Committee regarded as the necessary elements of an effective self-regulatory regime. The 
new PCC would have 18 months to demonstrate “that non-statutory self-regulation can be 
made to work effectively” by implementing appropriate reforms.54 In this report, Sir David 
recognised that such change would pose a significant challenge for the press but was adamant 
that if the challenge should not be met, namely ‘a less than overwhelming rate of compliance 
with the Commission’s adjudications...[or]...large-scale and deliberate flouting of the code of 
practice by the press or a total collapse in standards,55 then “a statutory system for handling 
complaints should be introduced.” 56 

5.14  Sir David’s report made clear that the primary function of the PCC should be to provide effective 
redress for complaints made by members of the public against the press, including the ability 
to  consider  allegations  of  unfair  treatment  and  unwarranted  infringements  of  privacy.  In 
addition, the Commission was to “publish, monitor and implement” a comprehensive code 
of practice for the guidance of both the press and the public, as well as to operate a 24 hour 
hotline for complainants. 

5.15  Sir David also made clear that the adjudication of complaints should be a clear and fast process 
and that, where a newspaper was demonstrated to be in breach of the code, an apology 
should be given to the complainant. Sir David also recommended that the PCC should be able 
to advise on the form and placing of replies or corrections. It is noteworthy that Sir David’s 
report made no mention of sanctions and instead placed emphasis on the preparedness of 
the press to adhere to the adjudications of the PCC.

5.16 

In addition, Sir David’s report made a small number of specific recommendations about the 
structure  and  function  of  the  PCC,  intended  to  address  concerns  expressed  by  the  three 
Royal Commissions as to the independence of the organisation. The report recommended 
that the PCC should have an independent Chairman supported by a Commission made up of 
no more the twelve Commissioners. These would be appointed by a separate independent 
appointments commission which would select and appoint on the basis of merit alone.

5.17  As had been the case after the second Royal Commission (but not other reviews less favourable 
to the press), the response of the industry was swift. The Press Council was duly disbanded, 
and in the spring of 1990 the five publishing associations in the UK (the Newspaper Publishers 
Association, the Newspaper Society, the Periodical Publishers Association, Scottish Newspapers 
Publishers  Association  and  the  Scottish  Daily  Newspaper  Society)  worked  together  to 
establish the Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF) for the specific purpose of funding 
the PCC. The PCC was itself incorporated on 1 January 1991 and, in a nod to the history of 
the self-regulation of the press as well as in recognition of his very real qualifications for the 
post, Lord McGregor was appointed as its first Chairman.57 However, the full Commission was

recommendation that there should be a fully independent appointments process.58

6.	 The	second	report	of	Sir	David	Calcutt	QC
6.1 

Although the PCC had been established speedily, standards of press behaviour remained a 
concern to politicians and members of the public alike because no immediate improvement 
in press behaviour was discerned. Indeed it has been suggested that despite the speed and 
promise of its establishment, the PCC quickly followed the modus operandi demonstrated 
by the Press Council in its responses to the Royal Commissions and Sir Kenneth Younger’s 
report on privacy in 1972.59 Many of the recommendations made by Sir David Calcutt were 
either  quietly  shelved  or  ignored  by  the  PCC.  Others  were  modified  or  implemented  in  a 
manner that benefitted the industry. For instance, the Code of Conduct was promulgated by 
the industry rather than the PCC itself and, as indicated above, the appointments process was 
not independent.

6.2 

6.3 

6.4 

The Commission also struggled to impose its authority on the industry; it has been argued 
that, in failing to commit to dealing with complaints from third parties, or indeed establish any 
investigatory arm, the regulatory function and capacity of the newly formed Commission was 
‘gravely weakened’ from the outset.60 In 1992 the Labour MP, Clive Soley, introduced a Private 
Member’s Bill on Freedom and Responsibility of the Press. The Bill proposed the creation 
of a statutory Independent Press Authority, with powers to enforce its rulings through the 
courts. Clive (now Lord) Soley has suggested that his Private Member’s Bill was intended to 
complement thinking around Sir David’s forthcoming follow-up review.61

Following  the  publication  in  The  Sun  of  the  detail  of  intimate  conversations  between  the 
Princess of Wales and James Gilbey, and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall 
(as she now is), the Secretary of State for National Heritage, David Mellor QC MP, gave a 
speech in July 1992 in which he reflected widespread public anger at the actions of The Sun. 
He described the press as drinking in the “last chance saloon”. Mr Mellor later complained 
that his stance on the need for reform of the press led to him being driven from office by a 
series of salacious stories about his private life although he acknowledges that the timing 
was coincidental.62 Perhaps with greater ambiguity, he has also suggested that some of that 
coverage was legitimate and a matter of public interest. 

In July 1992, Sir David Calcutt was asked by the Secretary of State for National Heritage to 
conduct a second review, the report from which was published in January 1993. This was 
just before Mr Mellor had left office in the circumstances explained above. David Mellor’s 
explanation to the Inquiry was that 18 months had elapsed since the press had been described 
by him as drinking in the “last chance saloon” in December 1989, and the matter needed to 
be re-assessed.63 There, Sir David analysed the record of self-regulation by the press since the 
formation of the PCC in January 1991. Sir David’s assessment was forthright. He contended

Part D | StandardsDthat self-regulation by the PCC had failed and called for the introduction of a statutory Press 
Complaints Tribunal. He summarised his conclusions as follows:64

“The Press Complaints Commission is not, in my view, an effective regulator of the 
press. It has not been set up in a way, and is not operating a code of practice, which 
enables it to command not only press but also public confidence. It does not, in my 
view, hold the balance fairly between the press and the individual. It is not the truly 
independent body which it should be. As constituted it is, in essence, a body set up 
by the industry, financed by the industry, dominated by the industry, and operating a 
code of practice devised by the industry and which is over-favourable to the industry.”

6.5 

Sir David’s second report made clear his view that the press was neither capable nor willing 
to  initiate  reforms  that  might  constitute  a  credible  alternative  to  statutory  regulation.  He 
therefore recommended that the proposals set out in his first report for a statutory “Press 
Complaints Tribunal” be enacted forthwith:65

“It has been argued that two years is too short a time in which to judge the Press 
Complaints  Commission.  But  the  way  forward  was  clearly  spelt  out  in  the  Privacy 
Committee’s Report. In particular, the Committee stressed the need for the Commission 
to be seen as an independent body which would command the confidence of the public. 
Both the Committee, and subsequently the Government, gave a clear indication that 
this was the last chance for the industry to put its own house in order. It has to be 
assumed that the industry, in setting up the present Press Complaints Commission, 
has gone as far as it was prepared to go. But it has not gone far enough.” 

6.6 

6.7 

If the conclusions reached in Sir David Calcutt’s second report were damning of the PCC, the 
recommendations for change were equally alarming for the supporters of self-regulation. The 
final report contained a detailed set of proposals for the wide-ranging powers that should be 
granted to that body. These included powers to establish and maintain a code of practice, 
prevent  the  publication  of  material  in  breach  of  the  code,  handle  complaints  in  relation 
to  alleged  breaches  of  the  code  (including  from  third  parties),  investigate  and  adjudicate 
on  breaches  without  a  complaint,  require  the  publication  of  adjudications,  apologies  and 
corrections, and, where appropriate, to hold full hearings.66 

The PCC and the industry rejected the analysis of Sir David. They argued that he had failed to 
pay sufficient attention to the relevant facts. The PCC said that the criticism of it was excessive.67 
Indeed, Sir David’s proposals were seen as a step too far by even the most adamantine critics 
of the press.68 However, the PCC did accept that some reform was required and under the 
leadership of its second Chairman, Lord Wakeham, changes were made to aspects of policy 
and procedure, largely to improve and expedite the complaints handling procedures.69

6.8 

Specifically,  amendments  were  made  to  the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice.  These  included 
requirements to restrict the use of eavesdropping and phone bugging techniques.70 Other 
changes included new guidance on how journalists should identify themselves when seeking

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundDstories.  In  addition,  the  board  of  the  PCC  was  reconstituted  to  include  a  majority  of  lay 
members (nine, including the Chair, alongside seven serving editors). Similar changes were 
also made to the independent Appointments Committee.

6.9 

In further changes, the industry agreed that the PCC should be granted powers to ratify, if 
so advised, the changes to the Editors’ Code of Practice recommended by the Editors’ Code 
of  Practice  Committee.  Funding  to  the  Commission  was  also  increased  substantially.  This 
enabled the development and introduction of a hotline for members of the public specifically 
to deal with incidents of harassment by members of the press, as had been recommended in 
Sir David’s first report.

6.10  The  weakness  of  the  press  response  to  the  second  Calcutt  report,  as  part  of  an  overall 
narrative, was demonstrated by an example provided by Lord Brooke, the Secretary of State 
for National Heritage between July 1992 and September 1994. He recalled that in 1993 the 
Sunday Mirror published photographs of the Princess of Wales exercising in a private gym.71 
Lord McGregor, then Chairman of the PCC, issued a public rebuke of the Sunday Mirror; but 
instead of showing contrition the paper’s response was to leave the system of self-regulation 
through the PCC.72 Lord Brooke suggested that this incident was instructive at many levels, 
demonstrating not only the weaknesses existing within the system of regulation, but also the 
refusal of the press to begin to countenance change until compelled to do so as a consequence 
of public indignation at its behaviour.73 Lord Brooke described the matter thus:74

“In the same way, another instance which I would quote from my own time, the episode 
of the Mirror in the first week of November 1993, when the photographs were taken 
of Princess Diana working out in a gymnasium, had a very powerful effect on the 
behaviour of the press immediately, because they had been resisting anything that 
in any way related to – either to Calcutt or to ourselves and indeed others, and then 
suddenly changed their minds when they realised that an episode as absurd as the 
Mirror episode, where the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission rebuked the 
Mirror – the Sunday Mirror, in fact – rebuked the Sunday Mirror for their behaviour, 
first led the Sunday Mirror to walk out of the Press Complaints Commission, and then 
to come back, and it was clear that some of the things that were being said to them 
about the degree of control that they had were actually being proved by reality.”

6.11  The Government did not immediately respond to Sir David’s second report. Rather, it waited 
until 1995, when the Secretary of State for National Heritage, Virginia Bottomley MP, rejected 
his recommendation for statutory regulation and instead supported the package of reforms 
that had been proposed by Lord Wakeham. The Inquiry has heard from witnesses who have 
sought  to  explain  the  nature  of  the  Government’s  response.  Sir  John  Major  has  told  the 
Inquiry that, although a matter of concern to his Government, the conduct of the press could 
not be regarded as a priority, nor, he noted, was there any agreement within the Government 
on the most desirable way forward.75 He recounted that his Government had to contend with 
other  more  pressing  and  immediate  demands,  including  the  UK’s  exit  from  the  European 
Exchange Rate Mechanism on Wednesday 16 September 1992.76 Sir John also suggested that 
the strength of Parliamentary opinion in relation to freedom of the press, particularly in the

Part D | StandardsDcontext of the Government’s diminishing Parliamentary majority, ruled out any more decisive 
action in this area.77

6.12  Sir John’s recollection of events has found a complementary echo in the evidence of Lord 
Brooke. He told the Inquiry that there was little appetite in Cabinet for the statutory solution 
proposed by Sir David in his second report.78 Lord Brooke also explained that a number of 
legislative  proposals,  through  which  press  intrusion  might  be  addressed,79  had  been  put 
forward  by  different  Government  departments.  These  included  both  a  privacy  tort  and 
proposals  to  make  some  forms  of  intrusion  a  criminal  offence.  Lord  Brooke  noted  that 
although there was some agreement in Cabinet on bringing forward legislation to introduce 
criminal offences, there was less accord in relation to the introduction of a tort of privacy.80 

6.13  Stephen Dorrell, the Secretary of State for National Heritage from July 1994 to July 1995, was 
responsible for the formulation but not the publication of the response to the second Calcutt 
report. He has helped complete this picture. He said that such were the disagreements in 
Cabinet around both the likelihood of the Government enacting legislation and the desirability 
of regulating the press, that the Government had “argued itself to a standstill”.81 He also noted 
that the reforms to the PCC proposed and then implemented by Lord Wakeham increasingly 
appeared to meet the needs set out by Sir David Calcutt without the requirement for time-
consuming and controversial legislation.82

6.14  Nonetheless,  many  have  suggested  that  Lord  Wakeham’s  appointment  and  tenure  was 
very much in the interest of the press. Lord Smith summarised industry thinking behind his 
appointment in this way:83

“I think the newspaper industry did not want statutory control and that they accepted 
they needed someone to be the chairman with a bit of clout, who could stop statutory 
control by getting the standards up to an acceptable level, and this was my view of 
what I thought they probably wanted.”

Sir John Major explained why Lord Wakeham’s appointment might well have been valued by 
the industry itself:84

“I mean, those who were at all queasy about it would then say, “Look, here is one 
of our own, a very respected former Cabinet Minister who is actually chairing the 
PCC. Therefore, why don’t we wait and see how well he gets on? Why rush ahead 
with legislation?” So his appointment did have a material effect upon views in the 
Parliamentary party.”

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundD6.15  However, Lord Wakeham was not appointed simply for his political skills. In perhaps the most 
important respect, he shared the values which were most cherished to the industry which 
the PCC was regulating. Lord Wakeham explained that he was a strong supporter of both 
press freedom and self-regulation:85

“I don’t think you could be a chairman of a body that was running a system of self-
regulation unless you believed in self-regulation. I think that would be a bit difficult. 
And I can’t imagine you being a very good chairman of a Press Council if you didn’t 
believe in press freedom. I would have thought they were pretty self-evidently things 
that were required for the job.”

6.16  Whilst it is clear that the PCC did introduce reform during the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, 
including the appointment of a Privacy Commissioner tasked with the oversight of each and 
every complaint  to  do  with  privacy, these changes did  not  amount  to  the creation  of  the 
organisation envisaged by Sir David Calcutt in his first report, but rather a PCC that met the 
minimum requirements of a Government increasingly disinclined to effect major reforms of 
the system of press regulation and fearful of the political ramifications of any such change. 

6.17  The  PCC  won  support  in  some  quarters,  including  in  Government,  for  the  breadth  of  its 
proposed  reforms  and  their  speed  of  implementation.  But  the  frank  evidence  of  Sir  John 
Major is pertinent on this issue:86

“In retrospect, yes. I mean, there were some things done. It has to be said on behalf 
of  the  PCC  that  it  did  make  some  changes.  They  were  relatively  trivial  changes, 
but they were changes. And they also, if I remember correctly, appointed a privacy 
commissioner from among their numbers, a Professor Pinker, at the time. So there 
were things that they had done, and the hope that Stephen Dorrell is expressing there 
is that John Wakeham would be able to persuade the media, the press, to go a good 
deal further than they already had done. It was, as you say, aspirational.”

7.  The death of Diana, princess of Wales
7.1 

The death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 was a wake-up call for the press. Although 
it did not generate a specific inquiry into press ethics, it did reignite a public demand for 
improvements in press behaviour. 

7.2 

7.3 

Considered as a whole, the reforms introduced in response to the public outcry were the 
most comprehensive ever introduced by the PCC. It should not be doubted that the reforms, 
which concerned amendments to clauses 4 and 6 of the Editors’ Code of Practice, did have 
an impact on the behaviour and actions of journalists, press photographers and paparazzi.

Nonetheless, it is apparent from the evidence that these changes were, as so many before, 
hard won from the industry and not freely given. Lord Smith provided a detailed description 
of the protracted negotiations between his Department and the industry through the offices 
of the PCC, in which despite the tragic background, the quite extraordinary levels of public

214

Part D | StandardsDconcern,  and  the  willingness  of  the  PCC  to  act  in  the  first  instance  as  regulator  and  then 
mediator, the final outcome was “relatively modest”.87

7.4 

7.5 

Lord Smith told the Inquiry that it was Government policy to seek to strengthen the system 
of  self  regulation  and,  in  particular,  to  bring  about  changes  in  relation  to  sanctions,  the 
definition of the public interest, and the issue of PCC pro-activity.88 Lord Smith made clear 
that he thought that tackling these three issues would effect far-reaching and lasting change 
in the attitudes of the industry such that the press “should not slip back into old ways when 
the events of the past week have receded from recent memory”.89

However, it is quite clear from the evidence both of Lord Smith and Lord Wakeham that the 
industry was unwilling to make concession in these respects. Rather the changes that were 
finally adopted were confined to those very few areas outlined above most closely associated 
with the direct circumstances surrounding the death of Princess Diana. Lord Smith testified 
that the industry demonstrated a disinclination to agree to any changes and did so only under 
duress after considerable public and political pressure was brought to bear. In his evidence 
Lord Smith recalled a meeting with Lord Wakeham in which the latter said:90

“If the government can keep up some external pressure on me, pushing me all the 
time to go a bit further, then that will be very helpful, he said, in enabling me to make 
better progress with the editors and proprietors.”

7.6 

Even in the evidence of Lord Wakeham it is clear that his ability to broker a solution was 
severely circumscribed by the unwillingness of editors and proprietors to concede ground:91

“bear in mind the changes in the code were not a matter for me; they were a matter 
for  the  editors  under  the  arrangements,  and  I  therefore  had  to  move  carefully  to 
make sure the editors went along with what I wanted.”

7.7 

Lord Smith recognised that one of the lessons from history was that the window of opportunity 
for reform was short. He said that over a period of months the attitude of the PCC shifted from 
operating as a regulator to championing the interests of the press. This was a metamorphosis 
which it may be argued was as inevitable and it was entirely understandable, as other ‘real 
world’ concerns impacted, in particular in relation to the possible ramifications for the press 
of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK domestic law.92

7.8 

Further, the reforms to the Editors’ Code of Practice that were introduced with effect from  
1 January 1998 were neither welcomed by the press nor much observed in the longer term. 
Lord Smith described these as:93

“... carried through, sometimes, I suspect, with gritted teeth amongst the editors and 
proprietors, because there was a public wind at the back of change. But that moment 
did not last for terribly long, and the equilibrium returned more or less to normal, which 
makes it very difficult for government to take strident steps to restrain press activity.”

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundD7.9 

Lord Smith said that, following the death of Princess Diana, Lord Wakeham, and by extension 
the PCC, “were stepping up to the plate and being a regulator”.94 But he, along with other 
witnesses to the Inquiry, stressed that the changes in press behaviour were of short duration:95

“I think it’s probably fair to say that for the two or three years following the Wakeham 
changes immediately after the death of Diana, the conduct of the press did improve. 
Certainly  in  terms  of  the  specifics  of  the  changes,  their  approach  to  the  coverage 
of  the  princes,  handling  of  children  and  minors,  some  of  the  intrusive  taking  of 
photographs, there was a palpable change of behaviour. But after that two to three-
year period, I think it began to slip, and as we know from all the evidence that you’ve 
been receiving, it slipped grievously in quite a number of ways.”

7.10  Evidently,  the  same  dynamics  that  played  in  the  aftermath  of  the  reporting  of  the  Royal 
Commissions and the reports of Sir David Calcutt were also apparent in the industry’s response 
at this point. The industry moved quickly to make a number of high profile but nevertheless 
limited changes which were in any event only begrudgingly accepted. In this case, they were 
ably guided by the dextrous political hand of Lord Wakeham who moved swiftly and adroitly 
to secure political backing for an industry-led response to these events.96 

7.11 

In 2003 Sir Christopher Meyer was appointed Chairman of the PCC, and the evolution of that 
organisation under his leadership is addressed elsewhere in this Report, in particular in Part J. 
The organisation which he inherited was hidebound by the structural and cultural constraints 
which this chapter has served to highlight. It would require a herculean task to break free 
from them.

8.  Conclusions
8.1 

At this juncture, it is opportune that I seek to draw out some brief lessons from the history 
of press self-regulation in the UK since the foundation of the General Council for the Press 
in 1953, as well as the public policy response to concerns at the conduct of some sections of 
the press.

8.2 

It must be made clear that the story is not all bad, in the sense that there have been a number 
of reforms in press regulation since the Second World War. That said, whilst recognising some 
of the good work that has been done in response to criticism, to changing attitudes and the 
clear recommendations of the reports, it is evident that many of the lessons of the post-war 
period  have  been  ignored.  This  chapter  of  the  Report  attempts  to  provide  only  a  cursory 
glance at the recent history of the British press, but it is patent that many of the concerns and 
practices that led to the establishment of three Royal Commissions, a Committee on privacy 
and the two reviews led by Sir David Calcutt, are the same as those which have led to the 
establishment of this Inquiry. This has been a history of strongly recurring themes. 

8.3 

An  equally  strong  recurrence  has  been  concern  about  the  inability  of  ‘self-regulation’  to 
address the underlying problem sufficiently, an inability which has been consistently pointed 
out by all of those who have examined the problem in depth. The history demonstrates a 
distinct and enduring resistance to change from within the press. This replication of pattern,

216

Part D | StandardsDof the wheels of history moving in concentric circles, has been demonstrated through the 
press response to the recommendations made and repeated over the years, the regulators’97 
response  to  those  recommendations  and,  it  must  be  said,  the  response  of  successive 
Governments to the clear advice they have been receiving. 

8.4  My conclusion on the cyclical nature of press self-regulation is not a novel one. Indeed, it 
was shared by many of the witnesses to the Inquiry. Lord Brooke suggested that the history 
of press self-regulation has been one of a distinct reluctance on the part of the industry to 
implement meaningful change. He noted that such change that has been effected has only 
been implemented in the face of the very real threat of statutory intervention:98

“But in the period since 1945, I observe that quite extraneous events, like a Private 
Members’ Bill, actually have had the effect of moving the story on quite a lot. In the 
case of the 1949 Royal Commission under Sir William Ross, there was a proposal that 
the press should have a general body of their own, and they showed no sign at all 
of doing anything about that until a backbench MP called Mr Simmons in 1952/53 
brought in a Private Members’ Bill, whereupon effectively almost instantly the press 
came around to the original recommendation in the Royal Commission.”

He continued:99

“In the same way, in 1989 – I noticed the text of Mr Dorrell’s account of how the 
Calcutt 1 was set up, but its actual genesis was the report stage of Mr Worthington’s 
bill entitled “Right of Reply” in 1989, and the government minister responding at the 
dispatch box on that bill basically foreshadowed Calcutt 1 in his response. So these 
things happen as a result of different, frequently unrelated episodes.”

8.5 

Lord  Brooke  perceived  a  causal  link  between  the  credible  threat  by  policy  makers  of  the 
introduction of statutory regulation for the press, and the introduction by the industry of 
limited measures to improve the existing system of self-regulation for the press, a system that 
has worked overall to the distinct advantage of the industry:100

“The  other  Royal  Commissions  and  Lord  Younger’s  Commission  weren’t  quite  so 
fruitful, but then there wasn’t a Private Member around to help.”

8.6 

The same reasoning  has been pursued more forthrightly in submissions  to the Inquiry by 
Professor Brian Cathcart of Kingston University. He told the Inquiry that in his view the history 
of press reform is one of failure to introduce measures recommended in terms to improve 
public trust in both the press and the system of self–regulation.101 He said that the attitude of 
the press to change in this area has been one of foot-dragging and obfuscation, with progress 
only occurring under duress:102

“I think you go back to the first Royal Commission, 1946 to 1949, I think, which reports, 
recommends  the  setting-up  of  a  Press  Council  and  it  takes  three  and  a  half  years 

97  the PCC advances the argument that it is not and never has been a regulator in the proper sense of the term, nor a 
fortiori were its predecessors; what it has done and how it has portrayed itself is analysed in Part J Chapter 2, but the 
term is used for present purposes

Chapter 1 | The Historical BackgroundDbefore the press – and an awful lot of leaning on and threats of legislation before the 
press will set something up. That, if you look through the history, and this is another 
thing that Hacked Off is doing, that sort of conduct is repeated and repeated.”

8.7 

8.8 

Similar  observations  were  made  by  the  Media  Standards  Trust,  which  submitted  to  the 
Inquiry a detailed analysis of the cycle of industry-led reform.103 Dr Martin Moore argued 
that  in  the  face  of  considerable  public  concerns  prompting  the  Royal  Commission  and 
other investigations into the behaviour of the press, the industry has been unmoved until 
“threatened  with  the  Damoclean  sword  of  some  form  of  statutory  regulation.” 104  Further, 
Dr Moore has said the paucity of reforms implemented by the industry has led to a cycle of 
“subsequent commissions, often within a decade” examining to all intents and purposes the 
same conduct that had originally generated those public concerns.105

The MediaWise Trust agreed, recalling with some concern that recommendations made by the 
Ross Commission in 1949, repeated in the report of the Shawcross Commission of 1962 and 
again by Lord McGregor in 1974, have yet to be implemented, particularly with regard to the 
prominence of apologies and corrections. However, in a somewhat different vein from other 
commentators, the Mediawise Trust suggested that it is incorrect to describe the history as 
cyclical, as this tends to obscure the fact that the calls for reform became increasingly strident 
and more forthright with time, and the refusal of the press to implement the changes at the 
heart of those reports more obdurate. 

8.9 

The historical lessons are clear enough, but the challenge for today is whether any of them 
will be taken on board. Those who complain about the conduct of the press106 are entitled 
to ask “How many chances must the press be given before something is done about it?” The 
problem is to decide whether that complaint is justified and, if it is, what that “something” is.

106  although this question relates to “the press” generally, throughout this Report reference is usually made to “a 
section of the press”.  As has been and will be emphasised, this is to underline the good work of most journalists and 
the enormous value that the press can bring to our democratic society. The fact that most of the press do not behave 
in a way that requires regulation does not, however, negate the need for such regulation to deal with those whose 
behaviour does not meet the high standards of the majority

introduction
This  Chapter  of  the  Report  will  look  at  the  Press  Complaints  Commission  (PCC)  as  the 
system  of  self-regulation  that  has  existed  for  the  press  since  1990.  Having  examined  the 
establishment of the PCC in the context of the publication of the first report into the press by 
Sir David Calcutt QC in June of that year, it will then look, in turn, at the powers, operation and 
standards of the PCC before considering both the role of Press Standards Board of Finance, 
which was established with the express purpose of providing sufficient funding for the PCC, 
and  the  Code  Committee  which  is  responsible  for  the  promulgation,  implementation  and 
amendment of the Editors’ Code of Practice, the cornerstone of self-regulation through the 
PCC.

This Chapter will also look at the operation of the Editors’ Code of Practice, together with the 
services that it offers to the public; this includes the anti-harassment hotline and its role as a 
complaints handling body. 

The purpose of this Part of the Report is to review the position of the PCC very much from the 
perspective of its own witnesses, rather than from that of those who are more critical of what 
it has done since January 1991. Some criticisms are reflected but are mentioned only. A more 
critical perspective requires a detailed analysis of the response of the PCC to allegations of 
systemic press misconduct (such as that which arose in relation to data protection following 
Operation Motorman and then to phone hacking following Operation Caryatid). That exercise 
has therefore been deferred until these incidents (covering a number of years) have been 
fully ventilated: the Report therefore returns to the PCC below.1

2.  the establishment of the pCC
2.1 

As  has  already  been  explained  above,2  the  PCC  was  set  up  following  the  first  report  into 
privacy and the press by Sir David Calcutt QC, published in 1990. 

2.2 

2.3 

The broad scope of Sir David’s Departmental Committee had reflected a growing concern in 
Parliament, as well as among the public more widely, about the behaviour of some parts of 
the press and the perceived failure of the Press Council, then the self-regulatory body for the 
press, to take effective action to deal with such behaviour. 

Sir David’s first report was published in June 1990. At that stage, he did not advocate the 
introduction of statutory controls. Rather, he recommended that the existing, and by this 
point largely discredited, Press Council should be abolished and replaced with a new self-
regulatory organisation, the Press Complaints Commission, which should deal with the many 
and substantive concerns that had been raised around the behaviour of some parts of the 
press. The new PCC would have 18 months to demonstrate “that non-statutory self-regulation 
can be made to work effectively.”

2.8 

As a result, in the spring of 1990, the five publishing associations in the UK (the Newspaper 
Publishers  Association,  the  Newspaper  Society,  the  Periodical  Publishers’  Association, 
Scottish Newspaper Publishers Association and the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society) worked 
together to establish the Press Standards Board of Finance (PressBoF) for the specific purpose 
of funding the PCC. The PCC was itself incorporated on 1 January 1991. 

The primary function of the newly incorporated PCC was to provide an effective means of 
redress for complaints made by members of the public against the press, including the ability 
to  consider  accusations  of  unfair  treatment  and  unwarranted  infringements  of  privacy.  In 
addition, the Commission was to “publish, monitor and implement a comprehensive code of 
practice for the guidance of both the press and the public”, as well as to operate a 24-hour 
hotline for complainants. Sir David made clear that the adjudication of complaints should be 
a clear and fast process and that, where a newspaper was demonstrated to be in breach of 
the code, an apology should be given to the complainant. Sir David also recommended that 
the PCC should be able to advise on the form and placing of replies or corrections. 

I now turn to the Editors’ Code of Practice. This set out standards of behaviour that journalists 
and editors should seek to uphold and also set down the rules by which the newspaper industry 
should adhere. The Editors’ Code of Practice was formulated by a Code Committee, formally 
a sub-committee of PressBoF which was made up of serving editors of both newspapers and 
magazines. The Code is explored in more detail below. Further, in a determined break with 
the past, the newly formed PCC also took a more proactive approach to dealing with some of 
the more challenging issues facing the press, producing a range of guidance which is valued 
by editors, particularly in the regional press.

However,  although  the  industry  had  moved  quickly  to  set  up  the  PCC,  standards  of  press 
behaviour remained a concern to both politicians and members of the public who did not 
discern any immediate improvement in that behaviour. Reflecting that widespread concern, 
the  then  Home  Office  Minister,  David  Mellor  QC  MP,  made  clear  his  view  in  a  television 
interview in 1989, describing the press as drinking in the “last chance saloon”. In July 1992, 
Sir David Calcutt was asked by Mr Mellor to prepare a second report analysing the record of 
self-regulation by the press since the formation of the PCC in January 1991. In that report, 
which was published in January 1993, Sir David argued that self-regulation by the PCC had 
failed and called for the introduction of a statutory Press Complaints Tribunal. 

Reiterating the history set out above, the PCC and the industry more widely both rejected 
the analysis of Sir David. However, the PCC did accept that some reform was required and 
changes were made to some of its policies and procedures in the light of the first 18 months 
of operational experience. Further changes were made in 1995, after the Government had 
published its eventual response to Sir David’s second report and the PCC has continued to 
keep its practices under review since then. 

Purpose of the PCC
The primary purpose of the PCC is set out in its Articles of Association.3 Article 53.1 of the 
Articles states that:4

2.9 

“The  primary  function  of  the  Commission  shall  be  to  consider,  and  adjudicate, 
conciliate and resolve or settle by reference to the Press Code of Practice promulgated 

3 http://www.pcc.org.uk/assets/111/PCC_Articles_of_Association.pdf
4 p12, ibid

220

Part D | StandardsDby PressBoF for the time being in force complaints from the public of unjust or unfair 
treatment by newspapers, periodicals or magazines and unwarranted infringements 
of privacy through material published in newspapers, periodicals or magazines (in 
each case excluding advertising by third parties) or in connection with the obtaining 
of such material but shall not consider complaints of any other nature.”

2.10  This is again set out in plain English on the PCC website in the form of a mission statement.5 

In that statement, it is said that the PCC is:6

“an independent body which administers the system of self-regulation for the press. It 
does so primarily by dealing with complaints, framed within the terms of the Editors’ 
Code of Practice, about the editorial content of newspapers and magazines … and the 
conduct of journalists.” 

2.11 

It is clear from this that the PCC understood itself to be a de-facto regulator and presented 
itself publicly as such. This difference between this perception and the reality is explored 
below.7

3.  Current powers, operations and standards
3.1 

Since its foundation in January 1990, there has been five Chairs of the PCC. These were Lord 
MacGregor (1991–1994); Lord Wakeham (1995–2002); Sir Christopher Meyer (2003-2009); 
Baroness Buscombe (2009-2011); and Lord Hunt (since 17 October 2011). Professor Robert 
Pinker served as Acting Chair from July to October 2011.

Membership of the PCC

3.2  Membership of the PCC is voluntary and as such there is no system of sanctions or incentives 
in place to induce those newspapers and magazines who do not subscribe to the PCC to do 
so.  Currently,  the  majority  of  national  newspapers  do  subscribe  to  the  PCC  but  there  are 
important and significant omissions to that membership. In particular, the Northern and Shell 
group withdrew its membership in January 2011 and, as a consequence, the Star and Express 
titles  have  not  been  subject  to  any  system  of  self-regulation  since  then  (although  Dawn 
Neesom, the editor of The Star, explained in her evidence that staff at both titles continued 
to abide by the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice during this period).

3.3 

3.4 

In addition to the majority of national newspapers, all regional titles and most magazine titles 
are currently members of the PCC.8 Subscription to the PCC is organised through the five 
print trade associations: the Newspaper Publishers Association, the Newspaper Society, the 
Periodical Publishers’ Association and the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society. 

The structure of the PCC
The framework for the membership of the PCC and appointments to the PCC are set out in 
Articles 5-9 of the Articles of Association. There are a number of classes of member of the

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the PressPCC, as set out at Article 6 which also established the appointments process for each class. 
The three classes of members of the Commission are as follows (see Article 6.1):

the Chairman;9

(a) 
(b)  public members; and
(c) 

press (or editorial) members.

Article 5 provides that there shall at any time be between nine and 17 members of the PCC. It 
also makes clear that at all times a majority of the members shall be Public Members rather 
than Press Members. Commissioners also serve as Directors of the PCC. There are at present 
17 members of the PCC.10

Appointment of members

The  Chair  of  the  PCC  is  appointed  by  PressBoF.  It  is  of  critical  importance  to  note  that, 
under the Articles of Association, PressBoF has absolute discretion to appoint the Chair on 
whatever terms it sees fit, and to vary or revoke that appointment. The most significant of 
the Articles of Association in this regard is Article 6.2, which provides that “the Chairman shall 
not be engaged in or connected with or interested in the business of publishing newspapers, 
periodicals or magazines (other than through his appointment as Chairman)”. 

It  is  clear  that  candidates  for  the  post  of  PCC  Chair  are  expected  to  have  knowledge  and 
expertise of the working of the press and also of regulation. For example, Sir Christopher 
Meyer was Press Secretary to Sir John Major from 1994 to 1997; during his tenure as Prime 
Minister  and,  before  his  appointment,  Lord  Hunt  had  prepared  a  report  on  the  future 
regulation of solicitors for the Law Society of England; prior to that, he had led the first review 
of the Financial Ombusdman Service.

In addition, the Inquiry has been told that a belief in the superiority of self-regulation above 
other  forms  of  regulation  is  a  requirement  for  all  candidates  applying  for  the  post.  The 
evidence submitted by Lord Hunt included a copy of the advertisement for the post of PCC 
Chair as it was advertised in 2011. The advertisement stated that candidates for the post of 
PCC Chair:11

“must be committed to the principles of self-regulation and freedom for the press.”

The Inquiry was told candidates are also tested on this particular issue during the application 
process.  For  example,  Lord  Grade  was  asked  at  interview  whether  or  not  he  supported 
statutory regulation, and Sir Christopher Meyer suggested that he regarded his tenure as PCC 
Chair as a success as he warded off the threat of statutory regulation.

The  Public  Members  and  Press  Members  of  the  PCC  are  appointed  differently.  According 
to  the  Articles  of  Association,  Public  Members  and  Press  Members  are  appointed  by  the 
Appointments  Commission  (Article  6.3).  This  Commission  also  has  absolute  discretion  to 
appoint Public and Press Members upon whatever terms and for whatever period it sees fit. 
Similarly, it has the power to revoke or to vary any appointment of a Public or Press member. 
Article 6.3 makes clear that no Public Member shall be engaged in, or otherwise connected

than through his appointment as a Commissioner). 

3.10 

In practice, however, the Appointments Commission has been abolished and responsibility 
for the appointment of Public Members has been taken on by the Nominations Committee. 
This reform was introduced following the Governance Review in 2009 but, at this point, has 
not yet been formalised as an amendment to the Articles of Association. 

3.11  The Nominations Committee is chaired by the PCC Chair and has two other members drawn 
from Public Members of the Commission. At present, Ian Nichol and Professor Ian Walden 
sit on the Nominations Committee along with the Chair. Vacancies for Public Members are 
advertised  publicly.  The  Nominations  Committee  considers  applications  and  then  makes 
nominations  for  the  whole  of  the  Commission  to  vote  upon.  As  part  of  the  process  of 
considering applications, the Nominations Committee consults with the Chair of PressBoF. 
The Nominations Committee is also responsible for appointing the Independent Reviewer 
and the Review Committee. 

3.12  Press (or Editorial) Member appointments are made by the trade bodies through PressBoF.12 

Functions of the PCC

3.13  The then Director of the PCC, Stephen Abell, provided detailed evidence to the Inquiry about 
the function and operation of the PCC. He briefly summarised the purpose of the Commission 
as: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

to investigate complaints, primarily from concerned individuals, that relate to the terms 
of the Editors’ Code of Practice;
to  deal  with  pre-publication  concerns  of  individuals  and  advocate  on  their  behalf 
with news organisations, with a view to preventing the publication of non-compliant 
material; and
to prevent harassment by journalists.

3.14 

In addition to this, the PCC also seeks pro-actively to contact individuals who might need 
the assistance of the Commission in their dealings with the press; provides guidance to the 
industry on a range of ethical issues (such as reporting on mental health issues); and works 
with titles to help raise standards across the industry.

Investigating complaints that relate to the terms of the Editors’ Code of Practice
The complaints process – assessment

3.15  One of the core functions of the PCC is the investigation of complaints relating to the terms 
of the Editors’ Code of Practice. Investigations are handled by the complaints officers in the 
PCC  secretariat.13  Each  new  complaint  is  assessed  by  a  complaints  officer  or  the  Head  of 
Complaints; at this stage, any complaint which falls outside the remit of the PCC or the Code 
of Practice is sifted out.14 It may be the case that the PCC has to ask for further details before 
a decision can be taken about whether or not the complaint falls within its competence.15

Stephen-Abell.pdf

15 p85, para 191, ibid. Commonly when asked for further information complainants choose not to pursue their complaints

223

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the PressWhen the PCC does not investigate 

3.16  The PCC does not investigate cases where no breach of the Code is raised in the complaint. 
Examples of this might include where the complaint was about a broadcaster, or where the 
complaint raised questions of taste and decency.16 The PCC might also decide that, if sufficient 
remedial action had been taken by a newspaper, no further action was necessary. 

3.17  When  a  complaint  does  not  fall  within  the  remit  of  the  PCC,  it  will  try  to  redirect  the 
complainant to the relevant alternative regulator.17 Where the complaint does fall within the 
competence of the PCC, but there is no prima facie case to answer, the matter may be put 
before the Commission directly without investigation.18 

3.18 

Investigation
If a complaint does raise a prima facie breach of the PCC Code, it is assigned for investigation 
to a Complaints Officer. Complaints Officers at the PCC play a dual role of both investigator 
and conciliator.19 Where a complaint is accepted for investigation, the PCC first writes to the 
editor of the relevant publication. That editor is sent a copy of the complaint and is asked 
to respond within seven days. There then follows three way correspondence, with the PCC 
Complaints Officer acting as the conduit between the complainant (or his/her representative) 
and the publication complained about.

3.19  The PCC has a protocol for disclosure.20 This document does not place either party under 
any obligation to provide key documents to the other party or to the PCC itself. The protocol 
provides that any material submitted by a publication to the PCC in the course of a complaint 
will be seen by the complainant. It also provides that the PCC will ‘consider on request providing 
to the complainant copies of our correspondence – conducted during an investigation – with 
editors’. The PCC has no power to subpoena documents, having argued in the past that a 
power of subpoena would contribute to delay in the system.21 There is no obligation on a 
complainant or a publication to disclose to the other party or to the PCC documents which 
might undermine a party’s own case or strengthen that of the other party. 

3.20  While  the  PCC  does  have  the  power  to  hold  oral  hearings,  that  power  has  never  been 
exercised. According to the PCC’s response to the 2010 Independent Governance Review, 
oral hearings would be undesirable because they might undermine two key virtues of the PCC 
system, namely that the system is free and fair.22 

3.21  On  some  occasions,  the  PCC  has  found  that,  after  the  conclusion  of  investigations,  it  has 
insufficient  information  to  reconcile  the  positions  of  the  parties  and,  as  a  consequence, 
has declined to come to any conclusion as to the merits of the complaint. There are other 
instances of PCC decisions in which the PCC has not upheld a complaint on the basis that 
there was not enough evidence for it to be sustained; on its face, however, it seems that if 
key documents were disclosed, the matter might have been resolved.

224

Part D | StandardsDAction to prevent publication of material that does not comply with the PCC Code

3.22  On occasion, the PCC coordinates with publications and complainants who are at the centre 
of a specific news story.23 Where the police are involved, the PCC might seek to approach the 
subject or probable subject of stories through the police (such as contact with Cumbria police 
following the shootings by Derrick Bird);24 or through other representatives such as solicitors 
(as in the case of Christopher Jefferies).25 The PCC can send a private advisory note to editors, 
making it clear that an individual does not want to speak to the media.

Preventing harassment by journalists

3.23  Harassment by journalists is covered by Clause 4 of the PCC Code. Where an individual asks 
a publication to desist from questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing him, the 
Code makes clear that publications should not persist in their pursuit of the individual.26 The 
PCC has developed a system whereby it can communicate the request of a complainant to an 
individual newspaper or to the whole print and broadcast industry. Since 2003, the PCC has 
operated a 24-hour helpline,27 the number for which is advertised on the PCC website. The 
system, referred to by some as a desist order, has been widely praised by both members of 
the public and those who have benefited from the system. However, it is notable that this has 
been used only rarely, and only in circumstances in which individuals have been placed under 
sustained, intense and intrusive media speculation.

Limitations on the PCC’s role

3.24  The Articles of Association also make express a number of explicit limitations on the PCC’s 

competence to consider complaints. These are:

(a) 

(b) 

the  PCC  can  only  consider  complaints  made  by  the  person  affected  or  by  a  person 
authorised by him to make a complaint (Article 53.3(a)); 
the PCC cannot consider a complaint where the matter complained of is the subject of 
proceedings in a court of law or tribunal in the United Kingdom (Article 53.3(b)); and

(c)  where the person affected has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law in the 
United Kingdom, the PCC may consider the complaint if in the particular circumstances 
of the case it appears to the Commission that it is appropriate for the Commission to 
consider a complaint about it.

The PCC only deals with complaints relating to an article in a newspaper, magazine or periodi-
cal, or on the website of a newspaper, magazine or periodical.

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the PressPowers and sanctions

3.25  The PCC has only limited powers available to it. For instance, as already observed, the PCC 
has  no  power  to  subpoena  documents.  The  PCC  also  has  a  range  of  sanctions  available28 
which, in brief, are:

negotiation of an agreed remedy;

(a) 
(b)  publication of a critical adjudication;
(c) 
(d) 

a letter of admonishment from the PCC Chairman to an editor;
follow-up by the PCC to establish what steps have been taken to avoid a repeat of a 
breach and what steps have been taken against those responsible for breaches; and
referral of an editor to his publisher. 

(e) 

3.26  Although  criticised  by  a  number  of  witnesses  (including  Dr  Martin  Moore  and  Professor 
Greenslade) as inadequate, Baroness Buscombe told the Inquiry that the current sanctions 
regime  available  to  the  PCC  had  been  broadly  effective.29  Indeed,  in  its  response  to  the 
Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee report, the PCC said “at present, the Commission 
believes that its powers are effective and can point to a culture in which its sanctions have 
real  impact”.30  The  PCC  has  also  pointed  to  the  growing  number  of  settled  complaints  as 
testament to the efficacy of the current sanctions regime. 

3.27  Both  Baroness  Buscombe  and  Sir  Christopher  Meyer  told  the  Inquiry  that  the  possibility 
of an adverse adjudication on an editor of a newspaper was a real and effective sanction. 
Sir  Christopher  said  that  editors  would  go  to  considerable  lengths  to  avoid  an  adverse 
adjudication and that this was to the benefit of the complainant.31 Baroness Buscombe went 
further, observing that editors reacted with fury to the announcement of an adverse PCC 
adjudication and that the effect of such an adjudication on an editor was considerable.32 In 
so doing, Baroness Buscombe has implied that the deterrent and punitive effect of a PCC 
adjudication was real. However, elsewhere in her evidence, she appeared to concede that 
the deterrent impact of an adverse adjudication from the PCC was not as effective as might 
have been suggested. She accepted that the anger she had experienced from editors when 
providing notice of a forthcoming adjudication was at the fact of personal criticism rather 
than its content and impact.33

3.28  Baroness Buscombe also explained that both the Daily Mirror and the Financial Times had 
threatened  to  leave  the  PCC  as  a  consequence  of  an  adverse  adjudication.  She  accepted 
the suggestion of the Inquiry that this reflected that the balance of power within the self-
regulatory system for the press may be wrong.34 However, she was emphatic that, although

Part D | StandardsDan issue for the system of self-regulation through the PCC, adverse and indeed disdainful 
reactions from editors to PCC adjudications were rare and limited to a small minority.35

3.29 

In a further reflection on this point, Baroness Buscombe acknowledged that the current state 
of affairs impacted directly on levels of trust in the PCC and that, as a consequence, there 
was very real difficulty in persuading both policy makers and members of the public that an 
adverse adjudication was, in fact, an effective sanction.36 It is important to note in this context 
that the PCC has no power to enforce its adjudications or rulings if they are ignored by an 
editor or publisher. The lack of power in this respect has been the subject of some criticism 
and had already been identified as an issue to be reviewed by the PCC Reform Committee by 
February 2012.37

3.30  A  further  analysis  of  the  punitive  and  deterrent  impact  of  adjudications  as  a  sanction  is 

undertaken later in the Report.38

Options for appeal or review

3.31  There is no avenue within the self-regulation system through which complainants can appeal 
against the substance of a PCC decision. The Inquiry has been told that this was the source of 
some frustration to complainants, and indeed, had dissuaded some from taking complaints to 
the PCC in the first instance. On occasion, parties who have been informed of the substance 
of the outcome of adjudications in their cases have asked the PCC to reconsider its decision.39 
However, when this happens, the PCC has only reviewed the process of the handling of the 
complaint and not the substance of the material decisions made. 

Charter commissioner and independent reviewer

3.32  The  position  of  Charter  Commissioner  was  introduced  in  2003,  together  with  a  Charter 
Compliance Panel, as part of the policy of ‘permanent evolution’ initiated by Sir Christopher 
Meyer.  The  function  of  the  Charter  Commissioner  is  defined  under  Articles  55  and  56  of 
Articles of Association as to:40

“consider  complaints  (other  than  complaints  relating  to  the  substance  of  an 
adjudication) from persons who have received a decision from the Commission and 
who are dissatisfied with the way in which the Commission has handled their matter.”

3.33  The first Charter Commissioner was Sir Brian Cubbon, who served until 2009. He was replaced 
by  Sir  Michael  Wilcocks  (who  became  the  first  Independent  Reviewer).  The  Independent 
Reviewer  is  now  Professor  Robert  Pinker  CBE:  he  served  as  a  Public  Member  of  the  PCC 
between 1991 and 2004 and was Acting Chair in 2002-2003 and in 2011. The role of the 
Charter Commissioner was characterised in the 2003 PCC Annual Report as being to ‘operate 
a sort of internal system of judicial review’. The Charter Commissioner is assisted in his work 
by the Charter Compliance Panel. Article 55.1 sets out the role of the Charter Compliance 
Panel as:41

3.34 

In practice, the Charter Commissioner and the Charter Compliance Panel provide an avenue 
through which a complainant might refer his or her complaint if he or she believes that there 
had been some procedural defect in the way that the complaint had initially been handled. 
However, the Charter Commissioner had no remit to look at the substance of a complaint. 
This  role  has,  since  the  independent  governance  review,  been  included  unaltered  in  the 
position of Independent Reviewer. 

Pro-active work by the PCC

3.35  The PCC produces Guidance Notes to assist the industry with particular issues where there 
is an apparent need.42 Such guidance has been produced on a range of subjects including: 
the reporting of suicide (developed together with the Samaritans); the reporting of people 
accused of crimes; payments to parents for material about their children and the reporting of 
court cases involving sex offences.

3.36  The PCC also publishes Annual Reviews. Among other information, these contain statistics 
about the number and types of complaints received. In addition, the PCC has in the past 
organised public events such as talks and Question & Answer sessions. 

4.  pressBof
4.1 

PressBoF, is responsible for the organisation and collection of the levy which funds the PCC 
from the newspapers and periodicals participating in it. PressBoF is a company limited by 
guarantee and was incorporated shortly before the inauguration of the PCC. The membership 
of the Board of PressBoF is set out under Article 5 of the Articles of Association.43 Currently, 
three  members  of  the  PressBoF  Board  are  drawn  from  the  Newspaper  Association;  three 
members from the Newspaper Society; two from the Periodical Publishers’ Association and 
two from the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society.44 The Board members are appointed by their 
trade  association  and  in  turn  appoint  the  Chair,  currently  Lord  Black  of  Brentwood  (who, 
between 1996 and 2003 was the Director of the PCC).

4.2 

The structure of PressBoF is based loosely on the funding body for the Advertising Standards 
Authority.45 However, whilst the funding structure underpinning that organisation has been 
made public, that is not the case with the PCC or PressBoF. As a consequence, there is little 
public understanding of how the PCC budget is financed. This has been the subject of both 
criticism and speculation. In addition to the oganisation of funding for the PCC, PressBoF also 
exercised full control over the appointment of the PCC Chair, as well as playing a prominent 
role in the appointment of new members to the Commission until changes were introduced 
as part of the 2010 Internal Governance Review.46

4.3 

The Inquiry has heard detailed evidence from Lord Black, who has been Chair since September 
2009, which has helped to explain the role of PressBoF as to the function of the PCC. He told 
the Inquiry that PressBoF not only funded the PCC through the collection and disbursement

Part D | StandardsDof the levy, it also had a fundamental role in relation to the exercise of its functions, as all 
decisions relating to the role and remit of the PCC must first be ratified by PressBoF. Lord 
Black explained that this was to ensure that no substantive changes were made to the role 
of the PCC without consultation with the industry.47 In part, this was enforced through an 
undertaking  made  by  Commissioners,  on  their  appointment  to  the  PCC,  not  to  agree  any 
changes to the articles of association without the express permission of PressBoF. This was 
one  of  two  such  undertakings  made  by  Commissioners  to  the  PCC,  the  second  being  to 
contribute £1 to the winding up costs of the PCC should this ever prove necessary.48

Lord  Black  also  explained  the  generality  of  the  PCC  funding  arrangements.  Payments  by 
national newspapers accounted for 54% of the levy, regional newspapers paid 39% of the 
levy and magazines paid the remaining 7%.49 Lord Black explained that, each year, PressBoF 
asked  the  national  press  through  the  National  Newspaper  Association  to  pay  a  specified 
amount towards the levy.50 The contribution from each member of the NPA was decided by a 
formula derived from the amount of news print consumed by each member and the number 
of publications owned by each member.51

This calculation was made through the NPA as some of the information needed to deduce 
the level of contributions to the levy was commercially sensitive.52 Although the membership 
of the NPA was in the public domain, the details of who paid for what were not public53 or, 
indeed, shared with PressBoF, as members of the Board or PressBoF staff may have links with 
the individual publishing houses.54 The monies collected through the levy were collected and 
passed on to PressBoF twice each year.55

Role of PressBoF in PCC appointments
PressBoF also plays an important role in the appointment of personnel to the PCC, 56 including 
to the position of Chair. Lord Black made the point that the appointment process had not been 
static but had changed, becoming increasingly transparent,57 over time: he noted that the 
appointment of the first Chairman of the PCC, Lord Wakeham in 1991, was done effectively 
by a tap on the shoulder, with no outside scrutiny or independent influence.58

By comparison, Lord Black explained that the appointment of Sir Christopher Meyer in 2003 
involved  the  use  of  specialist  recruitment  consultants.  The  process  for  the  more  recent 
appointment of Baroness Buscombe was more transparent, and was built around the public 
advertisement of the post in the national press.59 Further changes had since been made as 
a  consequence  of  the  independent  review  of  the  PCC  governance  processes;  these  were

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the Pressintended to make the appointment process more open and independent of the industry.60 
However, it is important to note that, although lay members of the PCC were involved in the 
appointment of Lord Hunt in 2011, they owned no formal role in the process.

4.8 

4.9 

The appointment of Lord Hunt incorporated these changes for the first time. Following the 
resignation of Baroness Buscombe, the position of PCC Chair was advertised in the national 
press in August 2011. A firm of recruitment consultants, Korn, Ferry, Whitehead, Mann, were 
appointed to manage the process for the first time and an independent assessor was also 
appointed to oversee the process. The independent assessor provided an audit note of the 
complete application process.

Applications  were  made  not  to  PressBoF  but  direct  to  the  recruitment  consultants.  They 
drew up an initial long-list which was discussed with both the independent assessor and the 
PressBoF Board. Those discussions resulted in the production of a shorter list and prospective 
candidates were interviewed by the consultants in the first instance. At that point, a final 
shortlist of some 12 candidates was drawn up by PressBoF and formal interviews took place 
during  September  2011.  A  subcommittee  of  five  members  was  involved  in  the  interview 
process. That committee made a final recommendation to the PressBoF Board.

4.10  The involvement of lay members was indirect. In the first instance, they were provided with 
an opportunity to put names forward for the post.61 Later, members were offered a meeting 
with Lord Hunt at which they were provided with an opportunity to give their views on the 
type of Chair they thought appropriate to the position.62 In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord 
Black  said  that  he  spoke  with  all  lay  members  of  the  Commission,  with  one  exception.63 
Further, the Deputy Chair of the Commission, Ian Nichol, was appointed to liaise between 
the independent assessor and the recruitment consultants to monitor the process.64

4.11  Lord Black rejected the notion, put to him by Robert Jay QC, that, in practice, the position of 
PCC Chair was a de facto political one, on the basis that the post did not deal with political 
matters. Lord Black also noted that Lord MacGregor of Durris, the first Chairman of the PCC, 
was a Liberal Democrat Peer.65 He also emphasised that the most recent recruitment process 
had been open to applicants from all political parties.66 Lord Black told the Inquiry that the 
politics of Lord Hunt, the fourth Conservative Party peer to have held the post of PCC Chair, 
had played no role in his appointment.67

The Editors’ Code Committee

4.12  The  Code  Committee  is  responsible  for  the  wording  of  the  Editors’  Code  of  Practice.  The 
Code  Committee  has  also  been  responsible  for  producing  the  Editors’  Codebook,  which 
brings together the Code and the PCC case law. The Code Committee is made up of editors 
appointed by the relevant trade bodies of the newspaper and magazine industry.

4.13  The  current  Chair  of  the  Code  Committee  is  Paul  Dacre,  the  editor-in-chief  of  Associated 
Newspapers. The PCC is represented through its Chair or Director at every meeting of the

Part D | StandardsDCode Committee and the PCC Commissioners must ratify any changes to the Code before 
they become valid.68

4.14  Lord Black has said that representation of serving editors on the Committee of the Editors’ 
Code of Practice is a basic requirement for the success of the system of self-regulation. In his 
view, serving editors brought necessary expertise and industry knowledge to the system and, 
in particular, an awareness of the dilemmas faced by staff in newsrooms.69 He suggested that 
majority industry representation was normal for systems of self-regulation, and was certainly 
the case with regard to systems of press self-regulation globally.70 However, Lord Black did 
concede that public or independent representation on the Code Committee or a successor 
body would need to be considered going forward, particularly as this would be central to any 
effort in rebuilding public trust and confidence.71

4.15  Having said that, Lord Black categorically rejected the notion that that the Code Committee 
was not suitably independent of either PressBoF or the industry more widely. He told the 
Inquiry that, whilst PressBoF provided funding to the PCC, and although PressBoF, through 
the Code Committee, determined the Code, the independence of the complaints process by 
the PCC was sacrosanct.72 He noted that his formal engagement with the Commission was 
rare, limited to one meeting each a year, the purpose of which was to update the Commission 
on the state of the industry. In his view, there was no capacity to exercise control over the 
function of the PCC.73

4.16 

Importantly, Lord Black clarified that the Editors’ Code of Practice Committee was a part of 
PressBoF and not the PCC. It was not, therefore, subject to the same level of lay scrutiny and 
influence as the PCC. Indeed, the only lay representation on the Editors’ Code of Practice 
Committee was through the Chair and Director of the PCC, who were entitled to attend in an 
ex-officio capacity.74 As neither were entitled to participate in discussions or in any decision-
making capacity, it is clear that the influence of lay members on the Committee was limited.75 

4.17  Witnesses from the PCC pointed to the merit in allowing serving editors to sit on decision-
making boards like the Code Committee, particularly in the light of the current knowledge 
and experience they brought of a fast moving industry. Similarly, a number of editors told the 
Inquiry that such input to the Code was crucial if the Code was to have sufficient credibility with 
the industry. The same point was also made by Lord Hunt, who stated that it was important 
that any rules for the press, particularly around standards, were written by professionals with 
an appropriate level of knowledge and experience.76 

4.18  However, there was some recognition that this knowledge could be brought to bear by former 
editors or, indeed, other industry experts. Lord Grade accepted that the codes developed by 
the Communications regulator Ofcom did not suffer because input came from former rather

also be achieved through other means, such as consultation on the content of a code with 
serving industry editors, rather than their direct input through representation on the Code 
Committee.78

4.19  On one occasion at least, the Code Committee had been required to play a role as arbiter 
of the meaning of a given provision of the PCC Code where the PCC found that there was 
ambiguity.79  On  22  September  2010,  Baroness  Buscombe  wrote  to  Ian  Beales  (Secretary 
to  the  Code  Committee)  asking  for  clarification  of  Clause  15  of  the  PCC  Code  (payments 
to  witnesses).80  This  was  in  the  context  of  the  Mail  on  Sunday  having  made  payments  to 
Baroness Scotland’s housekeeper. On that occasion, the Editors’ Code Committee took legal 
advice from Mr Jonathan Caplan QC, and that advice was relayed to the PCC by Ian Beales.81

The Editors’ Code of Practice

4.20  The Editors’ Code of Practice is the cornerstone of the system of self-regulation for the press,82 
and it is the responsibility of the PCC to ensure that the Code is properly enforced. The PCC’s 
website states that all members of the press have a duty to maintain the highest professional 
standards.83 It makes clear that these standards are set out in the Code of Practice, and that 
the Code acts as a benchmark for those ethical standards. According to the PCC, the Code 
protects both the rights of the individual and the public’s right to know. 

4.21  Although  there  was  later  comment  about  ways  in  which  the  Code  could  be  improved, 
witnesses to the Inquiry have, in the main, spoken favourably about its content. It has been 
praised by witnesses for being both readily understandable and usable. Even those witnesses 
who  have  been  otherwise  critical  of  the  PCC,  have  spoken  in  favourable  terms  about  the 
Code: for example, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, has described the Code as 
“good”.

4.22  The PCC makes clear just how the Code should be interpreted by editors: the PCC website 
states that the Code should be “honoured not only to the letter but in the full spirit”.84 Issues 
around  interpretation  are  elaborated  further  on  the  website,  including  the  unambiguous 
statement  that  the  Code  should  not  be  interpreted  “so  narrowly  as  to  compromise  its 
commitment  to  respect  the  rights  of  the  individual,  nor  so  broadly  that  it  constitutes  an 
unnecessary  interference  with  freedom  of  expression  or  prevents  publication  in  the  public 
interest.”85

4.23  Lastly, the PCC makes clear that “it is the responsibility of editors and publishers to apply the 
Code to editorial material in both printed and online versions of publications”. They should 
take care to ensure it is observed rigorously by all editorial staff and external contributors, 
including non-journalists, in printed and online versions of publications.

Part D | StandardsDAmendments to the Code

4.24  The Editors’ Code of Practice has developed through a process of iteration over the last two 
decades, responding to challenges and concern at the behaviour and actions of the press.86 
The Code has now been amended on at least 30 occasions, most notably following the death 
of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. 

4.25  The  most  substantial  of  the  amendments  made  to  the  Code  of  Practice  have  related  to 
privacy and, in particular, the privacy of minors. Specifically, new wording was introduced 
to clause 3 in relation to privacy. This was largely drawn from the European Convention on 
Human Rights which, at the time the amendments to the Code of Practice were made, was 
about  to  be  incorporated  into  UK  law.87  Significantly,  these  amendments  also  altered  the 
definition  of  a  ‘private  place’,  to  include  both  public  and  private  places  ‘where  there  is  a 
reasonable expectation of privacy’. Changes were also made to Clause 1 on accuracy to cover 
photographic manipulation.88

4.26  Further amendments to the Code sought to address concerns around the alleged role and 
actions  of  the  paparazzi  in  the  death  of  Princess  Diana  and  the  manner  in  which  some 
photographs  were  sought.  To  address  these  concerns,  provisions  on  harassment  were 
expanded and revised to include a ban in the use of information or pictures obtained through 
‘persistent pursuit’. This new Clause 489 also made explicit the responsibility of the editor not 
to publish material that had been obtained in breach of this clause, regardless of whether the 
material had been obtained by the newspaper’s staff or by journalists or other staff employed 
on a freelance basis.90

4.27  A new clause 6 was also introduced, making explicit provision for the protection of the rights 
of children to privacy while they were at school (previously, this clause had referred only 
to children under the age of 16). The revised clause 6 also forbade payments to minors or 
the parents or guardians of children for information involving the welfare of a child (unless 
demonstrably in the child’s interest), and introduced a requirement for a justification for the 
publication of information about the private life of a child other than the fame, notoriety or 
position of his or her parents or guardian.91 

4.28  The final changes saw the phrase ‘should not’ replaced by ‘must not’ throughout the Code, 
and the amendment of the section on the public interest to ensure that, in cases involving 
children, an editor must demonstrate an exceptional public interest to over-ride the normally 
paramount interests of the child.92

4.29  Despite  these  attempts  to  keep  the  Code  updated,  the  Inquiry  has  heard  some  criticism 
about the opaqueness of the drafting process, as well as the limited opportunity afforded to 
members of the public to influence the process of amendment. The Media Standards Trust, 
for example, said:93

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the Press“It [the Code of Practice] has grown up outside of public scrutiny, framed by those 
responsible for putting it into practice.”

4.30  This criticism has, however, been rejected by representatives of the PCC. Lord Black indicated 
that  there  were  a  number  of  means  through  which  the  public  could  contribute  to  the 
amendment of the code.94 He specifically pointed to the annual review of the Code, which is 
undertaken by the Code Committee, during which suggestions for amendments were invited 
from Committee members, interested parties and the public.95

4.31 

In  practice,  the  Inquiry  heard  that  the  opinions  and  views  offered  by  members  of  the 
public or from individuals outside of the newspaper industry were rarely heard. Lord Black 
acknowledged, in response to questions about the influence of lay voices and views on the 
Committee, that, as the Committee was “an Editors’ Code Committee”, the voice of the press 
was “bound to be predominant”.96 However, he also suggested that this potential bias was 
mitigated by the breadth of freely voiced opinion across the Code Committee.97

4.32  Lord  Black  was  asked  about  criticisms  that  the  Committee  was  slow  to  respond  or  adapt 
to criticism, that it had put the system of self-regulation ahead of the needs of individuals, 
particularly those who had been subject to abuse and mistreatment by the press, and had 
not looked critically or objectively at the efficacy of the system.98 He denied that any of these 
were sustainable criticisms, and suggested instead that the sustained level of funding by the 
industry for an independent system of self-regulation had brought about a number or real 
successes, including significant improvements to the behaviour of journalists and the press.99

4.33 

In particular, Lord Black noted improvements in behaviour related to harassment and the 
treatment  of  children  and  hospital  patients.100  He  also  suggested  that  a  key,  but  hidden, 
success of the changes that stemmed from the Code of Practice was the increased tendency 
of  editors  to  receive  and  deal  with  complaints  themselves,  particularly  around  accuracy, 
without referral to the PCC.101

4.34  Lord  Black  was  particularly  keen  to  make  clear  to  the  Inquiry  that  one  of  the  primary 
functions of PressBoF, as a body that represented the industry, was forcefully to promote 
press freedom.102 However, he rejected the notion that this had the potential to affect the 
overall balance of the Editors’ Code of Practice by the Code Committee, by giving greater 
weight to the issue of press freedom, noting that there was only one member of PressBoF 
who sat on the Code Committee. He did, however, concede that the 13 members of the Code 
Committee (editors in their own right) would have clear and deeply held views of their own 
on press freedom.103

Part D | StandardsD5.  Benefits of self-regulation
5.1  Witnesses from the PCC were clear about the benefits of a system of self-regulation for the 
press. They suggested that any form of statutory regulation for the press in the UK would 
also undermine the efficacy of the ex-ante interventions currently undertaken by the PCC, 
particularly work intended to stop the publication of particularly damaging or defamatory 
articles.104  If  this  function  were  passed  to  a  statutory  body  open  to  political  capture  then 
the potential for abuse of that function would have worrying and significant implications for 
freedom of expression.105

5.2 

5.3 

5.4 

5.5 

5.6 

To  illustrate  his  point,  Lord  Grade  provided  the  example  of  complaints  to  the  BBC  about 
Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand in October 2008. The BBC Trust was able to issue an apology 
and a correction within ten days, whereas Ofcom took almost three months to investigate the 
same complaint and reach broadly similar conclusions. Lord Grade also suggested that, given 
the nature of complaints directed to the PCC, speed of resolution is of primary importance to 
the complainant.

Lord Hunt said that he firmly believed in the value of self-regulation above formal statutory 
regulation, which he suggested was open to political interference.106 By contrast, he suggested 
that  independent,  voluntary,  self  regulation  of  the  press,  for  the  press  and  in  the  public 
interest was preferable and the optimal of the available approaches. Ideally, such a system 
of self regulation should be universal but he did not expand on his thinking as to how bodies 
outside that system might be induced to join.

Like  other  witnesses  to  the  Inquiry,  Lord  Hunt  has  argued  that  it  is  the  press  who  are  in 
best position to correct the perceived failings with the current system of self-regulation and 
develop  a  solution  that  is  more  appropriate  for  dealing  with  the  issues  described  to  the 
Inquiry. Lord Hunt also suggested it is only by the press working together that a system of 
regulation such as that outlined by Sir David Calcutt in his second report can be achieved.107

A similar line of argument was advanced by Baroness Buscombe, who told the Inquiry that the 
speed and flexibility of the current system are advantageous when compared with attempts 
to find resolution through the courts.108 She noted the harm that could be done to individuals 
as a consequence of drawn out court processes.109

In her evidence to the Inquiry, Baroness Buscombe suggested that the collaborative structure 
of the PCC was a strength.110 She suggested that had the system of self-regulation been closer 
to a formal regulatory process, with potentially a system of fines for breaches, the efficacy of 
the PCC in dealing with complaints and pre-publication issues would have been compromised. 
She has argued that such a change would have made the system more adversarial and would 
have  necessitated  the  involvement  of  lawyers  in  decision  making,  leading  to  drawn  out 
processes which would have resulted in a lesser service to the public.111

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the Press5.7 

Lord Hunt also suggested to the Inquiry that a regulatory regime backed in statute would 
not be sufficiently flexible as an independent self-regulatory system. In particular he worried 
that  a  regime  backed  in  statute  would  not  be  able  to  respond  to  new  challenges  as  they 
emerged, as such a system would require changes to the law and would be beholden to the 
Parliamentary timetable.112 By contrast, Lord Hunt argued, an independent regulator could 
make changes in a more timely fashion. Although Lord Hunt conceded that it was perfectly 
possible to base the new system on legislation that was not proscriptive, he suggested that 
his experiences as a Parliamentarian led him to believe that legislation could rarely account 
adequately for future circumstances.113

6.  anti-harassment policy
6.1 

The  PCC  operates  an  anti-harassment  hotline  for  the  general  public  through  which  an 
individual might communicate a desire for press attention to cease to newspapers. Such a 
request may result in the Commission issuing a desist order to newspapers after which press 
attention in the person in question should cease.

6.2 

In his evidence to the Inquiry, Stephen Abell said that the PCC anti-harassment service was 
one of the cornerstones of the “fast moving” part of the system of self-regulation for the 
press; something, that by implication may not be possible or practicable under a different 
system.114 The service was regarded by the PCC as an important complement to Clause  4 
(harassment) of the Editors’ Code of Practice. This states that journalists:

“must not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing individuals 
once asked to desist; nor remain on their property when asked to leave and must not 
follow them. If requested, they must identify themselves and whom they represent.”

6.3 

6.4 

6.5 

The anti-harassment service is intended, therefore, to provide members of the public and 
other  individuals  affected  by  the  actions  and  behaviour  of  journalists  with  the  means  of 
making express the terms of the Clause 4 of the Editors’ Code of Practice. 

Although  the  PCC  has  no  formal  responsibility  for  broadcast  journalists,  as  these  are  not 
covered by the terms of the Editors’ Code, the PCC has, as a rule, forwarded desist notices to 
broadcasters, who have then taken appropriate action to ensure that their journalists abide 
by the will of the desist notice. Mr Abell’s written evidence to the Inquiry noted that:115

“This helps to reduce the problem of “media scrums” that involve journalists from all 
forms of media.”

The anti-harassment service is accessed through the 24-hour helpline operated by the PCC. 
The PCC website provides comprehensive details of the service and the circumstances under 
which it might be used. The PCC has made clear that the initial telephone conversation with 
the  affected  party  or,  in  some  cases,  their  representatives  is  usually  handled  by  a  senior 
member of Commission staff. The PCC will also request an email setting out the concern or 
allegation from the individual in question. This email then becomes in effect the desist notice,

Part D | StandardsDwhich the PCC will then forward to a list of senior editorial and legal representatives. I note 
that Mr Abell has written that:

“Almost invariably, it is followed and the attention ceases.”116

6.6 

In his written evidence, Mr Abell suggested that the service could be used “prophylactically”. 
He provided the example of a grieving family who might contact the PCC ahead of an inquest 
or funeral, to make their wishes known. He noted that in such circumstance “the PCC will act 
to disseminate their position immediately.” I note that in this regard, the PCC has produced 
specific guidance both for bereaved individuals and also for journalists in relation to grief 
and intrusion into grief. This guidance encourages the bereaved to use the anti-harassment 
service. This guidance has been disseminated to all UK police forces and coroners’ courts.117

6.7 

The PCC has said in evidence that the anti-harassment service also had an application for 
individuals in the public eye. It was explained that a desist order acted as a check on the 
publication of paparazzi photographs obtained through harassment. Mr Abell stated:118

“The starting premise is that as soon as an editor publishes a photograph, he or she 
is taking responsibility for the conduct of the person providing it.”

6.8 

He noted further that:119

“This places the onus on the editor to take care over the publication of photographs 
of the affected individual. This in turn means that non-compliant photographs are not 
bought by newspapers or magazines, and the market for them dwindles. This in turn 
affects the behaviour of the paparazzi in regard to the individual.”

6.9 

The PCC suggested that the use of the anti-harassment service was the most effective means 
currently available of influencing paparazzi. Mr Abell’s written evidence explained that, as a 
class, the paparazzi were not regulated through any formal mechanism. Therefore, restricting 
the market for paparazzi photographs that may have been taken in breach of the code, or in 
contravention of a desist notice, helped to enforce standards of behaviour.120

* The PCC makes no distinction between a “desist notice” and a “private advisory notice”. A desist notice is an 
internal PCC term for a notice in relation to Clause 4 of the Editors’ Code of Practice (harassment).

6.10  At the time of writing, the PCC had issued 255 desist notices since January 2010 (as set out in 
Table D2.1). I note that, whilst there is no significant variance in the recorded monthly figures, 
the trend is towards the more frequent issue of these notices. 

6.11 

I have heard little evidence that has been critical of the anti-harassment service operated by 
the PCC and it would be appropriate, therefore, to restrict myself to some general comments 
only. I note, first, that the service appears to be well regarded. The PCC has provided me with 
evidence of the efficacy of this service in helping those in often extraordinary circumstances 

238

Part D | StandardsDto benefit either from a desist notice or in helping affected parties manage press and other 
media interest. 

6.12  This additional evidence was submitted in response to comments made in evidence by Gillian 
Shearer, the Communications Director for the Cumbrian Police Force, in relation to shootings 
in  Whitehaven  in  Cumbria  in  July  2010.  Ms  Shearer  described  what  she  regarded  as  the 
aggressiveness  of  the  press,  the  impact  on  the  families  concerned  and  the  failure  by  the 
press to adhere to the police notice requesting that the media respect the families’ wishes 
for  privacy.  She  also  criticised  what  she  suggested  was  the  failure  of  the  PCC  to  respond 
meaningfully both to events but also the wishes of those individuals affected.121

6.13 

In the evidence he has provided to the Inquiry, Michael McManus, the Transitional Director of 
the PCC, has sought to correct this perception of the actions of the PCC; he provided the Inquiry 
with a detailed description of the PCC’s activities in response to events in Whitehaven. It is to 
be borne in mind that although the events Mr McManus has described were extraordinary, 
they illustrate well the services the PCC is able to offer those individuals who become the 
subject of intense press attention. Mr McManus has written that:122

“On the day of the shootings, a member of PCC staff spoke briefly to Cumbria Police and 
followed up immediately with an email providing our contact details and explaining 
how we could help deal with concerns about media scrums and prepublication issues. 
A similar email was also sent to local hospitals.”

6.14  Mr McManus noted that during this difficult period members of PCC staff were in regular 
contact  with  police  communicators.  In  addition,  the  PCC  issued  a  private  advisory  notice 
on behalf of one individual who had become the subject of unwanted media attention and 
handled a number of formal complaints about published material. I note that the then Director 
of the PCC, Mr Abell, travelled on 9 July 2010 to Cumbria to meet with police communicators, 
local clergy and the editor of the Whitehaven News. The Whitehaven News subsequently 
published a letter from Mr Abell setting out the PCC’s services, and encouraging people to 
make contact with the PCC if they wished to do so.

6.15 

It is also clear that the PCC undertook a great deal of work in relation to events in Whitehaven. 
Mr McManus notes that:123

“The PCC stayed in touch with the police after the shootings, and also initiated contact 
with the local Coroner”. 

It is right to record that the PCC provided some assistance to Professor John Ashton, chair 
of the West Cumbria Shootings Recovery Group, in drafting a letter to the media requesting 
restraint ahead of the formal start of Inquest hearings in 2011. The PCC also worked with the 
police and Coroner to identify those individuals who had decided not to speak to the media; 
the Commission circulated a desist request on their behalf, requesting that they not be con-
tacted.

6.16 

It is clear that the work of the PCC was wide-ranging. In May 2011, the PCC organised a public 
meeting in Carlisle to enable local communities to speak to its representatives. The panel also 
included the then editor of the News and Star (Carlisle), Neil Hodgkinson. Mr McManus has 

121 pp65-67, lines 2-2, Gillian Shearer, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Transcript-of-

122 Michael McManus’ evidence is available on the Inquiry’s website
123 Michael McManus’ evidence is available on the Inquiry’s website

239

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the Pressalso told the Inquiry that following these events, the PCC has amended the guidance it offers 
to families in dealing with the media following a death.

6.17  This is not to say that there are still not concerns with the anti-harassment service that should 
not be elaborated. Although the PCC website provides clear advice on the services available 
to members of the public with regard to harassment by journalist and photographers, it also 
sets a number of steps that the affected parties should follow before contacting the PCC. In 
certain circumstances, these steps might prove to be unduly difficult or, indeed, impossible 
to  fulfil.  They  depend  both  on  the  goodwill  and  cooperation  of  the  journalists  and  press 
photographers  involved,  as  well  as  on  the  substantive  efforts  of  the  affected  party  who, 
feasibly, might not be in a position to comply with the suggested steps.124 The PCC website 
states:125

“There  are  a  number  of  practical  steps  that  you  can  take  to  avoid  unwanted  or 
repeated approaches:
1.  Get the name of the journalist and the newspaper or news agency for which they 
work. Tell them politely that you do not wish to speak to them and that they should 
not  contact  you  again.  Say  that  you  understand  that  under  the  Code  of  Practice 
journalists must not persist in contacting you having been asked to desist. It will help 
if you tell them that you are saying the same to every journalist. This applies however 
a journalist is approaching you – whether it is at home, in a public place or over the 
telephone. You should then be left alone. If you are not, see point 5, below.
2.  If you are at home and too distressed to answer your door, pin a short note to it 
to say that you do not wish to speak to journalists and do not want to be disturbed.
3.  Similarly,  if  you  are  being  telephoned  repeatedly  and  do  not  wish  to  speak  to 
journalists, alter your answerphone message to say that only personal callers should 
leave a message as you are not speaking to the media.
4.  Some  people  –  particularly  at  times  of  grief  or  shock  –  find  it  helpful  to  ask  a 
friend or neighbour who is not as closely associated with the story to deal with press 
enquiries. They can then answer your phone and door and either pass on a prepared 
statement (reflecting what is said in point 1) or turn down requests for interviews.
5.  If these measures fail and you feel that you are still being harassed, contact the 
PCC immediately.”

6.18  However,  whilst  the  PCC  guidance  with  regard  to  harassment  is  in  most  respects  clear, 
there are significant caveats and exemptions to desist notices. In those cases where it has 
been  impossible  for  the  individuals  concerned  to  establish  the  names  of  the  journalists 
or newspapers in question, the PCC makes no claim to be able to take action. Even then, 
however, the website still encourages members of the public in such circumstances; it states 
thereafter that the PCC:126

“may then be able to communicate your concerns across the industry as a whole via 
a general “desist” message, which should alleviate the problem.”

In so doing, the website makes no claim to the certainty of success of any action on the part 
of the PCC in this regard.

240

Part D | StandardsD6.19  Lastly, it is also important to underline that the website states that, in those cases in which 
there is a perceived public interest, there is no obligation on the part of the press to heed 
a  desist  notice.  The  website  does  not,  however,  elucidate  what  any  public  interest  might 
be, and does not provide the public and more specifically the users of the service with any 
degree of certainty or clarity on this important issue. Perhaps of more importance, it leaves 
those individuals and their families who may already be in some distress open to continued 
and unwarranted press attention.127 

7.  Complaints
7.1 

I will now look how complaints are dealt with by the PCC, considering in turn the different 
aspects of that system: who might make a complaint; the circumstances in which an individual 
might  complain;  the  limitations  on  the  ability  of  a  complainant  to  make  a  complaint;  the 
informal resolution of complaints; and complaints deemed inadmissible. 

7.2 

7.3 

7.4 

Before  doing  so,  there  is  value  is  in  setting  into  context  the  complaints  handling  process 
operated by the Commission. First, it is worth noting that the level of complaints received 
by  the  PCC  is  neither  disproportionate  nor  excessive;  the  number  received  by  the  Irish 
Press  Ombudsman  is  broadly  similar,  when  adjusted  for  population,  as  is  the  number 
received by Ofcom, in relation to content. The number of complaints rejected by the PCC 
is also comparable to the numbers rejected by Ofcom. The majority of complaints to other 
regulators, however, are rejected because the complainant has not followed due process and 
has used the regulator in question, rather than the regulated company, as the starting point 
for the complaint. In such cases, the complaint is referred back to the company in question. 
However,  this  option  is  not  available  to  the  PCC  as  very  few  UK  newspapers  have  formal 
complaints processes beyond the discretion of the editor.

It is also important that the Inquiry provides a context to any discussion of the complaint-
handling process with the detail of the volume of complaints considered by the PCC. The 
figures for 2010, reported by the PCC in 2011, are the most recent full figures available, and 
are broadly similar to those received up to 2010. In that year, the PCC received a little over 
7,000 complaints. Of these 1,687 resulted in a ruling128 and 44 in adjudications. Only two 
publications had more than one upheld adjudication against them.129 

It is without doubt that the handling of complaints was the main and dominant part of the 
PCC’s business, taking up most of the day to day function of the Secretariat. After salaries, 
administration and property costs, complaints handling accounted for the greatest part of 
the remaining budget. Exact figures have not been provided to the Inquiry, but it has been 
suggested  by  witnesses  that  the  PCC  budget  was  only  just  sufficient  for  its  purposes  and 
only just stretched to cover these costs, with no remainder for any other actual or proposed 
function. This raises serious questions about the ability of the model proposed by Lord Black 
to provide for an investigatory arm within the funding envelope suggested.

7.5 

Evidence  presented  to  the  Inquiry  by  the  PCC,  and  taken  from  the  routine  surveying  of 
complainants, suggests that the level of satisfaction among complainants with the conduct 

127 http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=Mzg2Mw
128 This number of complaints (7,000) ‘includes multiple complaints (where more than one person complained about 
the same article), as well as those that did not fall within the Commission’s remit or were not pursued after an initial 
contact’ PCC Annual Review 2010

241

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the Press7.6 

7.7 

7.8 

of complaints handling by the PCC is genuinely high.130 Lord Hunt said in evidence that that 
the satisfaction rate among complainants to the PCC was very high. He suggested that 80% of 
complainants were satisfied at the outcome of their complaint. However, this figure has been 
called into question by other evidence submitted to the Inquiry. It has been suggested that 
such a figure can only be reached if all complaints are understood to have been resolved in a 
manner satisfactory to the complainant.

Certainly, witnesses to the Inquiry have recognised that the secretariat and, in particular, the 
complaints handling staff at the PCC make considerable effort to be courteous and helpful. 
The MediaWise Trust, an independent press watchdog that monitors the behaviour of the 
press, has noted that in the surveys of complainants that they have undertaken, respondents 
score the staff highly against these criteria.131 Complainants also appreciate the speed with 
which PCC staff deal with issues raised by complainants in the course of the complaints.132

PCC witnesses to the Inquiry have certainly drawn attention to the apparent satisfaction at 
the speed of the complaint-handling process and the value placed on this by complainants. 
Sir Christopher Meyer gave evidence that, in most cases, resolutions were reached within 
a month of the complaint first being lodged.133 Given that most editors dislike the personal 
criticism inherent in any upheld adjudication, it is unsurprising that they will work hard to 
reach a resolution to the satisfaction of the complainant.

The PCC website makes clear that the Commission will deal with complaints as expeditiously 
as it is able. The website points to an average turnaround for the resolution of complaints of 
34.8 days.134 However, in evidence presented to the Inquiry, the Media Standards Trust has 
suggested that this figure is misleading as it takes account of complaints which do not fall 
into the jurisdiction of the PCC and are therefore rejected. The Media Standards Trust notes 
that, although such complaints are passed on to the relevant body or organisation, they are 
regarded by the PCC as ‘resolved’. The Media Standards Trust suggests that the inclusion of 
such cases therefore serves to distort both rates of satisfaction, as well as the record of the 
time taken to resolve a complaint. The Media Standards Trust deduced from available PCC 
data that the actual figure of turnaround was an average of 106 working days, three times 
greater than the PCC figure.135 That said, there are limits to the analysis of any of the PCC 
data, as the Commission publishes information which omits the date on which a complaint 
is received. 

7.9 

Who can complain
The website states that the PCC is an independent body, which has been set up to examine 
complaints  about  the  editorial  content  of  UK  newspapers  and  magazines  (and  their 
websites).136 It makes clear that the PCC exists to help complainants and that its services are

Part D | StandardsDfree. The PCC website explains that the Commission will deal with all editorially-controlled 
material in UK newspapers and magazines (and their websites). Examples are provided:137
•  Articles and pictures;
•  Words and pictures (including video) on newspaper and magazine websites; 
•  Audio material on newspaper and magazine websites;
•  Readers’ letters; and,
•  Edited or moderated reader comments on newspaper and magazine websites. 

7.10  The website also explains that the PCC will also consider complaints brought in relation to the 

behaviour of journalists. Again, examples are provided. These are:138
•  Persistent pursuit of individuals 
•  Refusing requests to stop taking photos or asking questions 
•  Using hidden cameras to obtain material 
•  Failing to be sensitive when dealing with cases involving grief and shock 
•  Failing to obtain the proper consent before speaking to children or people in hospital. 

The website further explains that Complaints have to be judged against the terms of Editors’ 
Code of Practice.

7.11  Most importantly, the website makes clear that the PCC will only “normally accept complaints 
only from those who are directly affected by the matters about which they are complaining.”139 
It  explains  that  individuals  who  meet  that  criterion  are  able  to  make  complaints  to  the 
PCC and  may raise  complaints  through  the Commission  against any newspaper, magazine 
or  publication  which  subscribed  to  PressBoF.140  The  website  also  explains  the  limited 
circumstances in which third parties are able to make complaints. Such complaints will be 
considered by the Commission only in those circumstances where the third party has signed 
authorisation to act on behalf of the individual concerned.141 

7.12  Lord Hunt has said that there is “misunderstanding” around the PCC’s policy on complaints 
from third parties: they have always been able to bring complaints in relation to accuracy. 
However, it is clear from Chapter 1 above that, as a matter of history, it has proved difficult 
to bring third party complaints. Further, the evidence received from the PCC in this regard 
might be said to contradict this account. Thus, Mr Abell explained that it was not the policy 
of the PCC to take account of complaints from third parties.142 This evidence chimes with 
that  received  from  a  number  of  groups  who  drew  attention  to  the  difficulties  they  have 
encountered in the face of this policy.

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the Press7.13  However,  the  policy  of  the  PCC  has  not  been  entirely  inflexible,  in  particular  in  the  fairly 
limited  number  of  cases  where  a  single  article  has  given  rise  to  a  very  large  number  of 
complaints. In some instances, complaints received from third parties may cause the PCC 
to contact the subject named in the article in question, or someone directly affected by that 
article, to consider whether they would take forward a complaint.143 

7.14 

In this regard the case of Stephen Gately is instructive. An article published by the Mail on 
Sunday about the singer’s death, written by columnist Jan Moir in 2009, prompted a record 
number  of  complaints  from  members  of  the  public  to  the  PCC.144  In  response,  the  PCC 
contacted Mr Gately’s partner and asked if he would consider submitting a complaint.145 In 
the event, the PCC did not uphold the complaint, although it considered that the article had 
come close to breaching the Editors’ Code of Practice. 

Time limits and delay

7.15  The  PCC  website  clearly  sets  out  a  timetable  for  members  of  the  public  seeking  to  bring 
a  complaint  against  a  newspaper.146  Thus,  in  most  circumstances,  the  PCC  will  not  accept 
complaints made more than two months after the date of publication (or over two months 
after the end of direct correspondence between a given complainant and an editor, provided 
that  correspondence  was  entered  into  straight  away).147  The  same  section  of  the  website 
also explains that complainants can formally submit a complaint to the PCC if the newspaper 
in question has failed to respond to the complaint within one week of the receipt of that 
complaint, but goes on to say that if the article in question remains available on the publication’s 
website, this time limitation does not usually apply. Beyond the strict timeframe set down by 
the PCC for the initial submission of the complaint, however, the times for each subsequent 
element of the complaints-handling process are not specified and no guidance is provided 
as to the likely duration of that process. Rather it suggests only that the steps involved in 
reaching the stage of an adjudication are less formal and are likely to be determined on a 
case by case basis.148

7.16  There  are  a  range  of  resolutions  that  may  be  offered  by  titles.  However,  the  PCC  has 
no  powers  to  stipulate the  form of  resolution  that  might  be  offered  by the  newspaper  in 
question. Resolution can take the form of published apologies, the correction of the content 
in question in a future edition, the removal of the offending article from the title’s archives or 
online editions, or private letters of apology. In a limited number of circumstances, resolution 
might also include ex-gratia payments or donations to charities or other organisations. 

7.17  Some witnesses to the Inquiry have complained about what they regarded as an unnecessary 
slow  process  that  was  prone  to  delay.  Some  have  said  that  lengthy  periods  between 
correspondence and delay were not uncommon. According to an analysis undertaken by the 
Inquiry  of  complaints  to  the  PCC  between  January  2009  and  May  2012, declared  to  have 
been  resolved  during  that  period,  the  time  taken  to  resolve  a  case  can  vary  significantly. 
In the fastest example, the resolution of a complaint took one month; in the slowest case

Part D | StandardsDthe  process  appeared  to  have  lasted  for  three  years.149  The  value  of  an  apology  or  other 
resolution after such a period of delay is questionable. 

7.18  Will Moy of Full Fact stated that whilst some complaints resulted in a prompt response from 
the newspaper in question, sometimes within a day of two, in other cases the process of 
reply was much slower, taking as many as 21 days.150 In a limited number of circumstances 
no reply had been received from the newspaper.151 In its evidence, Full Fact provided details 
of a number of complaints, including one about an article published in the Evening Standard, 
where that newspaper did not respond until two months after the initial submission to the 
PCC.152 Similar experiences have been documented in the evidence provided by ENGAGE.153

7.19  The majority of complaints submitted to the PCC and ruled admissible are settled through a 
process of informal mediation between the complainant and the title in question. Only a very 
small number of complaints are not resolved in this manner, and those which fall into this 
category go forward for adjudication by the PCC. Complainants have a period of one month to 
appeal in writing to the Independent Reviewer should they wish to contest the PCC’s decision 
(although, as already identified, the Independent Reviewer will only look at the way that the 
PCC handled the complaint and not its merits).154 The PCC website provides details of a total 
of 5,241 complaints that have been the subject of PCC rulings since 1996.155 It lists 257 such 
complaints in 2012, (as set out in Table D2.2) of which 96.1% were informally resolved, 1.6% 
were upheld at adjudication and similar a proportion were not upheld.156 In 0.8% of cases the 
PCC found that the newspaper question had taken sufficient remedial action to declare the 
complaint resolved.

Chapter 2 | Self-regulation of the Pressshow a trend towards the informal resolution of an ever larger number of cases, although this 
is from an already high base. Unfortunately, these figures do not relate to figures published in 
relation to complaints in the PCC Annual Reviews for 2009, 2010, and 2011.157 Those Reviews 
refer  to  complaints  received  in  a  given  year,  and  break  down  the  details  into  somewhat 
different categories.

7.21 

It has been suggested by the PCC that the very large number of cases resolved informally, 
and  through  no  process  of  adjudication  by  the  PCC  or  the  sustained  intervention  of  the 
PCC through mediation, represented a ‘substantial and hidden success of self-regulation’.158 
Others have claimed that the odds are heavily stacked against the complainant, and that the 
PCC does not always appear to be neutral. But Mr Abell suggested that the position of the 
complaints handler was one of neutrality:159

“So I don’t think it’s a neutral act by complaints people. I think their job is to grip 
the issues and to try and bring them to a conclusion, and that will invariably be by 
assisting the complainant.”

7.22 

In particular, Mr Abell suggested that there was no validity in the assertion that the PCC’s 
preferred outcome of a mediated resolution was in the better interest of editors and newspapers 
rather than the complainant.160 Sir Christopher Meyer also rejected the characterisation of 
the complaints-handling process as attritional, in which intense pressures were placed on 
the complainant to resolve issues through mediation rather than pursuing a decision through 
the PCC and that the effort in reaching that resolution wass made disproportionately by the 
complainant.161

An Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press might not be thought to engage 
or require detailed consideration of the law but, as many witnesses have correctly identified, 
the starting point from which any assessment of the way in which the press goes about its 
business must be the general framework of the law. In that regard, there have been criticisms 
that the press is already far too over-regulated with particular reference to the complications 
of  the  ever-changing  criminal  and  regulatory  law,  itself  requiring  training  for  journalists, 
as  well  as  the  equally  ever-developing  civil  law.  In  this  second  category  falls  not  only  the 
jurisprudence in this country (in respect of which particular criticism has been made of the 
law of defamation) but also the effect of the Human Rights Act 1998, which gave further effect 
in domestic law to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 (Cmd. 8969) (ECHR). That has led to litigation 
involving the press that has not infrequently been taken through the UK courts and has then 
been the subject of further argument before the European Court of Human Rights.

The purpose of this Inquiry is not to analyse the law in any depth but, in order to provide a 
wider picture to anyone interested in the issues affecting the press, it is necessary to provide 
some background in relation to the criminal law, the civil law and the regulatory framework 
provided by the Data Protection Act 1998. Where the law touches upon specific issues which 
fall within the Terms of Reference, a degree of analysis will follow in the text. Otherwise, a 
general outline has been provided in Appendices to the Report. Nobody should rely on the 
Appendices as a complete review of the nuances of the law: there are text books for that 
purpose. It is intended only to identify the broad landscape.

The criminal law can touch upon the work of journalists in many ways and inevitably prescribes 
the ways in which it is acceptable for stories to be obtained. A brief summary of aspects of 
the criminal law most likely to be engaged in the pursuit of journalism is at Appendix 4 but 
it is neither complete in detail nor is it comprehensive. By way of example, aspects of the 
behaviour of Neville Thurlbeck as he pursued a follow up to his scoop relating to Max Mosley 
were described by Mr Justice Eady in the ensuing civil litigation as containing “a clear threat 
to the women involved that unless they cooperated … (albeit in exchange for some money)” 
making the point that it was “elementary that blackmail can be committed by the threat to do 
something which would not, in itself, be unlawful.”1 Blackmail is not, however, a crime that is 
covered in this Appendix. There is no doubt room for other potential offences to be engaged 
in the unprincipled pursuit of a story.

In addition to the substantive criminal law, it is also necessary to consider aspects of criminal 
procedure  which  recognise  the  important  place  that  journalism  plays  in  our  society  and 
accords to journalists special protection in relation to journalistic material. The restrictions and 
limitations on the powers of the police to search for or seize such material add to the privileges 
that society gives to those involved in this work: they are summarised in Appendix 4.

The  same  is  so  for  the  civil  law.  Developments  have  undeniably  broadened  the  focus  in 
defamation  beyond  meaning,  justification  and  fair  comment.  In  addition,  new  concerns 
surround the concept of privacy. This has developed with the increasing recognition of the 
significance of Article 8 of the ECHR which, subject to exceptions, provides for everyone the 
right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. Running

PART E  |  Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil Law

parallel to Article 8, however, is Article 10 which, similarly subject to exceptions, provides 
that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions 
and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and 
regardless of frontiers. A brief summary of the most important aspects of the civil law insofar 
as it affects journalism or journalists is set out at Appendix 4. Again, it is not intended to be 
exhaustive.

1.6 

1.7 

A separate analysis has been completed in relation to the law of data protection (see Appendix 
4). That is because it has criminal, civil and regulatory aspects and stands outside the areas of 
law so far outlined with the Information Commissioner being accorded, by statute, powers and 
responsibilities which go beyond the power to prosecute, or to commence civil proceedings. 
Given that the Terms of Reference specifically cover “the extent to which the current policy 
and regulatory framework has failed including in relation to data protection” the remit of 
the Information Commissioner will require detailed analysis beyond the brief synopsis of the 
legislative framework.2

Against the background of this framework, this Part of the Report will focus chronologically 
on the criminal investigations that have been undertaken both in relation to data protection 
and interception of mobile telephones, the outcome of those investigations and the reaction 
not  only at the time but  as further material entered  the public  domain.  In  particular, the 
milestones that led to this Inquiry include:

E

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 
(e) 

(f) 

(g) 

the publicity accorded to the investigations by the Information Commissioner through 
reports to Parliament and discussions with the PCC;
the  outcome  of  each  of  the  criminal  prosecutions  and,  in  particular  in  relation  to 
Operation Caryatid, the police strategy adopted thereafter;
the reaction of the press (and, in particular, the News of the World) to the prosecutions 
along with the response of the PCC;
the impact of civil litigation;
the investigations undertaken by the Guardian and, subsequently, the New York Times 
along with the reactions of the police and Parliament to each of the articles;
the  further  civil  litigation  and  the  proceedings  for  judicial  review  of  the  strategy 
adopted  by  the  police  following  the  successful  prosecutions  of  Clive  Goodman  and 
Glenn Mulcaire;
the  re-opening  of  the  criminal  investigation  and  the  reactions  thereafter  of  News 
International, the PCC and Parliament.

1.8 

The purpose of this Part of the Report is to provide what is a vital narrative to the background 
against which the criticisms of the culture, practices and ethics of the press (or part of the 
press) can be considered. It starts with the police operations that led to Operation Motorman, 
which  was  an  investigation  that  fell  to  the  Information  Commissioner.  The  narrative  then 
passes to Operation Caryatid, the police investigation of interception of voicemail messages 
(phone hacking) and its consequences, which continue to be felt today.

1.	 Operation	Reproof
1.1 

In  2001,  the  Devon  and  Cornwall  Police  were  investigating  an  allegation  of  blackmail  in 
Plymouth which sprang from the fact that a member of the public had obtained details of the 
criminal convictions of someone else. Not surprisingly, the police were concerned to discover 
how those details had been obtained and, in the course of the investigation, evidence was 
uncovered  that  an  officer  serving  with  the  same  force  had  accessed  the  Police  National 
Computer (PNC) record of the victim. It was suspected that he had passed the information to 
individuals working as private investigators, and that the information had ultimately reached 
the hands of the suspect.

1.2 

1.3 

1.4 

In  December  2001,  therefore,  a  series  of  searches  of  various  premises,  which  supported 
that concern, were carried out. Material was seized which indicated that police officers and 
support staff from the force had been obtaining details of criminal convictions and information 
about the keepers of identified vehicles which were stored on police computer systems and 
then passing that information to private investigators, who would in turn pass it onto their 
customers. The private investigators were, in the main, retired police officers.

E

Thus, in January 2002, Operation Reproof was initiated. The Senior Investigating Officer for 
that investigation has now retired: his deputy, now Detective Chief Superintendent Middleton 
(then holding the rank of Detective Inspector) gave evidence to the Inquiry.1 The purpose of 
the operation, initially, was to scope the material that had been seized during the blackmail 
investigation, with the following terms of reference:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

to investigate the alleged offences and conduct interviews of the individuals identified 
as being in “jeopardy”;
to establish links with other agencies to identify individuals who had unlawfully revealed 
confidential information, and to preserve evidence in support of suspected offences 
and to interview those individuals; and
to report to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Police Complaints Authority.

Through  an  analysis  of  a  “huge  amount  of  evidence”   the  police  discovered  a  network  of 
companies  and  individuals  throughout  the  UK, acting  as  investigators, who  were sourcing 
information on demand, either directly from a person serving with the police or through a 
third party.2 In particular, the police found that a small number of police officers who had 
retired from the Devon and Cornwall Police had set themselves up as private investigators for 
the commercial market and were obtaining information from former colleagues who were 
still working within the police service or other agencies, such as the Department for Work 
and Pensions. The information was then passed through a network of individuals before it 
reached the ultimate customer. In most cases that ultimate customer was three or four links 
up the chain.

1.9 

The police sought to identify all the links in the chain and ascertain who in the chain knew 
that  the  information  had  been  obtained  unlawfully.  The  customers  were  found  to  be 
requesting either specific pieces of information or packages, which could include a person’s 
criminal background, their financial situation, medical history, telephone records and current 
whereabouts.  The  customers  ranged  from  individuals  involved  in  matrimonial  disputes  to 
large  financial  institutions  including  insurance  companies  and  debt  recovery  agents.  The 
police found no evidence that the companies were aware that the information was being 
obtained illegally.

The investigation also showed that serving and retired officers from other police forces were 
involved in similar illegal activities, and had links with the suspects in Devon and Cornwall. 
The relevant forces were contacted, including the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the 
police forces of Dorset, Northumbria, Surrey and Essex.

The investigation led the police to a ‘data gathering’ company based in Surrey called Data 
Research Ltd. Data Research featured heavily as the third link in the chain. As it happened, 
at the same time, the Information Commissioner was conducting an investigation into the 
same company. On 8 March 2003, the police executed a search warrant at the company’s 
offices  during  the  course  of  which  a  significant  amount  of  information  was  found  which 
indicated that data had been obtained unlawfully from the DVLA. This information formed 
the basis of Operation Motorman, an investigation then also conducted by the Information 
Commissioner (ICO) which has formed an important part of the narrative to the Inquiry. From 
this investigation, the ICO passed material to the MPS, which gave rise to Operation Glade. 
For convenience, having dealt with Operation Reproof, the narrative will pass on to Operation 
Glade and then to Operation Motorman.

DCS  Middleton  explained  that  the  CPS  and  the  Police  Complaints  Authority  advised  the 
police to focus the investigation on (i) individuals who were either systematically providing or 
receiving information unlawfully from databases, and (ii) the customers who knew or ought 
to have known that the information had been obtained unlawfully. The upshot was that two 
serving police officers, two retired police officers and two individuals associated with Data 
Research Ltd were charged with misconduct in public office offences and Data Protection Act 
offences.

On 17 October 2005 a pre-trial hearing took place at Exeter Crown Court before the trial 
judge, His Honour Judge Darlow. The defence argued that the proceedings should be stayed 
for an abuse of process. Although not directly relevant to this abuse of process submission, 
the  defence  also  contended  that  accessing  the  databases  and  the  subsequent  passing  of 
information  obtained  to  insurance  companies  was  “not  that  serious”  and  that  unlawfully 
accessing the PNC could not amount to the criminal offence of misconduct in public office.3 The 
prosecution argued that the unlawful disclosure of the information was serious, irrespective 
of the use to which the data was intended to be put.

1.10  On 19 October 2005 the judge gave judgment on the issues raised. He roundly rejected the 
defence submission that the proceedings should be stayed for an abuse of process. However, 
he also expressed the provisional view, not central to his principal conclusion in relation to 
the application of which he was formally seized, that the act of a police officer accessing the 
PNC and providing the information to a former colleague might not in the circumstances of 
this particular case amount to misconduct in public office, and in any event the matter was 
not terribly serious.

Chapter 2  |  Police Investigations Start

1.11 

In any event, following the judge’s comments, a number of case conferences took place with 
the CPS and prosecution counsel. With the judge’s comments in mind it was decided not to 
proceed on the basis that it would not be in the public interest given the potential costs that 
would be incurred. In short, DCS Middleton confirmed in evidence that a fair summary of the 
position was that the judge caused the CPS to ask itself, “do we want to spend all this time on 
a trial if the judge is of the view either (a) that the facts may not make out an offence, or (b) 
that if they did, it is not a terribly serious matter.”4 I do not comment on the judge’s expression 
of opinion (also reflected in the sentences which had been passed in relation to Operation 
Glade  discussed  below).  I  do,  however,  add  that  whatever  might  have  been  the  position 
considered by the judge and, in consequence, by the CPS in 2005 should not be assumed to 
represent a current assessment of whether conduct of that type constitutes misconduct in 
public office or the gravity of such conduct.

1.12 

In evidence, DCS Middleton was asked why journalists were not within the scope of Operation 
Reproof. He answered:5

“I think I need to make clear that they weren’t out of scope. The whole inquiry right 
from the outset was extremely open, an open-minded approach as to what we would 
discover.  The  initial  information,  as  we  said,  linked  pretty  much  specifically  to  a 
local investigation, detective private investigation agency in Devon and the flow of 
information was from the police officer and the other staff I’ve mentioned through to 
that private investigator, up one or two more chains, and we were tracking customers 
each and every occasion, open-minded as to who those customers would be, and we 
never found any direct evidence or indirect evidence linking that information being 
requested by or for any part of the media or journalists.”

E

1.13 

In his witness statement, DCS Middleton said that:6

“There was no direct evidence found during the course of the investigation that any 
media  organisation  was  in  any  way  involved  in  the  obtaining  of  illicit  information 
being investigated…”

1.14 

In evidence he was asked whether there was any indirect or inferential evidence that a media 
organisation was involved. DCS Middleton responded:7

“As I’ve said right from the outset, the mindset of myself as the senior investigating 
officer and my team, who were thoroughly professional throughout, was we were 
open-minded  as  to  what  we  would  find  and  we  would  have  dealt  with  that  and 
pursued that based on information or evidence that we had. We deal with information, 
intelligence  and  evidence.  The  CPS  were  working  alongside  us,  as  were  the  Police 
Complaints Authority. We did not have anything that directly or indirectly linked to 
journalists. Had we done so, we’d have thoroughly investigated that.”

2.	 Operation	Glade

Operation Glade is an example of a police investigation which, on the face of it, may be thought 
to  demonstrate  partiality  or  favour  to  journalists  which,  it  is  argued,  has  been  rendered

more credible in the light of the evidence that has emerged about the relationship between 
the press and the MPS generally or with certain senior officers in particular. Although self 
contained, therefore, it is important to deal with the possible perception.

Operation Motorman8 was commenced because an audit by Devon and Cornwall Police had 
identified that Paul Marshall, a civilian member of the police staff at Tooting police station, 
had  been  accessing  the  PNC  and  obtaining  information  for  Steve  Whittamore,  a  private 
investigator. A search warrant (executed with the Information Commissioner’s investigators 
present) at the latter’s premises demonstrated that he was involved in obtaining details of 
an individual’s criminal history by way of a check through the Criminal Records Office (CRO) 
or details of his or her address by way of a check on the registered keeper of a vehicle. A 
large number of such checks were on behalf of the national press, where the information 
subsequently appeared. As we have seen above, Devon and Cornwall Police had also searched 
the premises of the data gathering company, Data Research Ltd; this was the corporate alter 
ego of Mr John Boyall. Evidence was obtained that indicated he was involved in the same 
types of activity as Mr Whittamore.

The evidence relating to Data Research Ltd was referred to the MPS, which first carried out a 
scoping exercise in order to decide whether the matter should formally be investigated. The 
investigation (Operation Glade), began in August 2003 with Detective Chief Inspector Mick 
Allen appointed as the Senior Investigating Officer and DCI Brendan Gilmour (then Detective 
Inspector Gilmour) as the Investigating Officer.

During the course of his evidence DCI Gilmour recognised that, when scoping the investigation, 
he and his colleagues were alive to the sensitivity of investigating journalists but said that 
he  could  not  recall  specific  discussions  about  the  issue.  He  expressly  disavowed  that  the 
investigators were in fear of the press: 9

“Well,  considering  the  work  that  we  were  doing,  investigating  corrupt  police 
employees,  police  officers  and  members  of  civilian  staff,  investigating  journalists 
didn’t present any fear. There wasn’t any fear involved at all. But we did recognise 
the significance of what we were doing and the attention that that would attract and 
that would obviously shape how we approached that, but it certainly wouldn’t have 
stopped us doing it and there was no trepidation around it.”

He also denied fearing a backlash from the press.10

DCI  Gilmour  was  asked  whether  the  resource  implications  of  taking  on  journalists  and 
powerful newspapers, who would have access to sophisticated legal advice, were a factor in 
their decision-making. His response was that such considerations would not have stopped 
the investigating team from doing what it needed to do.11

The terms of reference of Operation Glade were ultimately set down as follows: 12

“To  investigate  (covertly)  at  this  time  the  allegations  against  Marshall  in  order  to 
prove  or  disprove  his  involvement  in  the  offences  alleged.  The  parameter  of  the 
investigation  at  this  time  will  include  Marshall  himself,  John  Boyall  and  possibly

Stephen Whittamore. There appears to be clear evidence that Marshall is conducting 
illegal  PNC or CRO checks on behalf of John Boyall  at the request of a number of 
reporters. The aim of the investigation will be to gather evidence of Marshall, Boyall 
and Whittamore’s involvement in the misuse of the PNC or CRO systems with a view 
to prosecuting them for any offences disclosed or to prevent further misuse. Early 
consultation  will  take  place  with  the  CPS  regarding  appropriate  charges  should 
sufficient evidence be obtained.”

2.8 

2.9 

It is noteworthy that the terms of reference did not expressly encompass investigating the 
journalists who had received the information. In the event, however, it became clear that DCI 
Gilmour did not consider that this limited the extent of the investigation or prevented the 
investigators from turning their attention to those journalists at the appropriate time.

Through analysis of telephone data relating to Mr Marshall, the Operation Glade investigators 
established that a retired police sergeant, Alan King, had been acting as the conduit between 
Mr Marshall on the one hand and Mr Boyall and Mr Whittamore on the other. There was no 
evidence that any other police personnel were involved. On 10 November 2003, Mr King was 
arrested.

2.10  Meanwhile, from the very detailed ledgers of Mr Whittamore’s business, the investigators 
found invoices to journalists setting out what information was sought and his fee for obtaining 
that information. Contrary to the approach adopted in relation to Mr King, on or around 16 
January 2004 DCI Gilmour decided to interview the journalists identified in the ledgers under 
caution (and therefore as suspects) but also decided, as an operational matter, not to arrest 
them, but to invite them to attend voluntarily for interview.

2.11  The difference in approach was explained on the basis that DCI Gilmour was confident that 
the attendance of the journalists could be secured voluntarily, whereas the same was not so 
in relation to Mr King. He said:13

E

“The default isn’t always to arrest in the first instance. My consideration then were 
what is it that I was hoping to achieve and what I wanted to achieve was to interview 
the  journalists  under  caution.  I,  through  the  legal  departments  of  the  various 
newspapers, was able to access and secure the attendance of the journalists, and 
that was relatively straightforward, I think, without any complication. Whereas King, 
I didn’t have that access to King and it was necessary…to secure his attendance at 
the police station for investigation interview by arresting him…for every suspect, it’s a 
consideration as to whether or not they need to be arrested in order to achieve what 
it is you want to achieve.”

2.12  He also explained it was not necessary to arrest the journalists because, given the evidence 
in the ledgers that the journalists had requested the information, there was no need to carry 
out searches of the journalists’ premises (arrest carries with it certain powers of search under 
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984).14 It is not without interest that this approach 
was not adopted in relation to Clive Goodman during the course of Operation Caryatid and 
neither is it necessarily accurate: in any case which is dependent on circumstantial evidence, 
whatever documentary evidence can be found is always likely to add weight (or detract) from 
the strength of the case. Having said that, however, the legitimacy of different approaches 
by different officers must be accepted and there is no evidence or basis for suggesting an 
ulterior motive.

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil Law

2.13  Between  19  January  2004  and  31  January  2004,  the  police  interviewed  seven  journalists 
under  caution.  As  anticipated  each  attended  voluntarily  and  was  legally  represented.  All 
the journalists admitted that they had used Mr Whittamore to obtain information but each 
denied knowing that the information was being obtained unlawfully. DCI Gilmour said that 
a number of the journalists gave the account that they believed that the information was 
coming from the courts and that “CRO” stood for “Court Record Office”. DCI Gilmour made 
it clear that it was put to them in interview that they must have known that Mr Whittamore 
was not obtaining the information from a court office because of the speed of turnaround of 
the requests, sometimes a matter of hours. However, each adhered to the line and claimed 
that  he  would  not  have  used  Mr  Whittamore  or  any  agency  had  it  been  known  that  the 
information was being obtained unlawfully. DCI Gilmour said that it was specifically put to 
them that, by their very nature, details of convictions must have been obtained unlawfully. 
The journalists simply pleaded ignorance.

2.14  The police sought the advice of the CPS as to the likelihood of successfully prosecuting all the 

suspects, including the journalists, and as to the appropriate charges.

2.15  The CPS advised that Messrs Marshall, King, Boyall and Whittamore should be charged with 
conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. As regards the journalists, the CPS advised 
that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone because it was unlikely to be proved 
that there was the requisite degree of knowledge that the information was being unlawfully 
obtained. DCI Gilmour explained his disappointment at the view of the CPS that they could 
not prove the necessary guilty knowledge.15 The Inquiry has not investigated the reasons for 
this conclusion (which some may argue appears overcautious): the relationship between the 
CPS and the press has not been the subject of investigation. What can be said with certainty, 
however, is that this material does not provide any evidence that the failure to prosecute 
any of the journalists was influenced or motivated by any fear of the press on the part of the 
police, or by any improperly close relationship.16

2.16  Messrs  Marshall  and  King  pleaded  guilty  to  the  conspiracy  charges.  A  count  of  obtaining 
personal information contrary to s55(1)(a) of the Data Protection Act 1998 was later added 
to the indictment against Messrs Boyall and Whittamore. They pleaded guilty to that offence 
and the conspiracy charge was left to lie on the file.

2.17 

In  April  2005  all  four  defendants  were  given  conditional  discharges  and  further  details, 
including the judge’s sentencing remarks, are in Chapter 3 below. DCI Gilmour made it clear 
that these sentences were a disappointment for the police. In May 2005, the CPS sought 
counsel’s advice as to the merits of a reference under s36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1998 
to  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  challenge  the  sentences  on  the  ground  that  they  were  unduly 
lenient. DCI Gilmour explained that for a number of legal reasons, on which he was not able 
to elaborate, counsel advised against this course of action. The comment made in paragraph 
1.11 above about current perceptions of the gravity of this type of conduct is repeated.

15 p69, lines 1-2, DCI Gilmour, ibid
16 For my part, it seems remarkable that notwithstanding all that has been written about criminal records over the 
years, the journalists all misunderstood the meaning of the acronym “CRO” or believed that a search of court records 
could have been accomplished within the time of the response. That said, I am not suggesting that the advice of the 
CPS, on which the police were bound to act, was based on anything other than an objective and independent minded 
assessment of the strength of the evidence. The Inquiry has gone no further than this summary identifies; its value is 
simply as part of the history of attempts to use the criminal law in this area.

Introduction
The  information  arising  from  Operation  Reproof  caused  the  Office  of  the  Information 
Commissioner (ICO) to focus attention on Steve Whittamore. As a result, on 8 March 2003, 
a team of investigators led by Alexander Owens from the ICO, and alongside police officers 
from Operation Reproof, searched the premises of the private detective agency run by Mr 
Whittamore. They seized a significant volume of documentation detailing an extensive trade 
in personal information. Mr Owens and his team then undertook a comprehensive analysis 
of  the  seized  material  and  observed  a  clear  audit  trail  between  the  requests,  supply  and 
payment for personal information relating to a range of subjects. The customers requesting 
and being supplied with personal information included a significant number of journalists, 
employed by a range of newspaper and magazine titles.

Ultimately, the implications of this material were of sufficient significance that the ICO was 
prompted  to  lay  before  Parliament  two  reports  setting  out  a  summary  of  the  evidence 
obtained as part of the investigation: What Price Privacy? and What Price Privacy Now? The 
reports also called for stricter penalties for those engaged in unlawful activities, in particular 
for breach of s55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). This provision makes it an offence to 
obtain, disclose or procure the disclosure of confidential personal information, knowingly or 
recklessly, without the consent of the organisation holding the data.1 This chapter explores 
the  essential  narrative  surrounding  this  investigation  and  the  evidence  obtained  during 
Operation Motorman.

E

2.	 The	genesis	of	Operation	Motorman
2.1 

On 11 November 2002, during the course of the search of the premises of Data Research 
Ltd, as part of Operation Reproof, Mr Owens observed documents containing lists of Vehicle 
Registration Marks (VRMs) that appeared to have been checked for vehicle owners’ personal 
details.2 The documents recorded the owners’ details alongside the VRMs and also contained 
times and dates when the searches had been carried out. Mr Owens contacted the Driver and 
Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) with a number of the listed VRMs and the DVLA confirmed 
that all the numbers has been searched through the DVLA records by the same employee. 
Mr  Owens  also  confirmed  that  the  times  and  dates  recorded  on  the  seized  documents 
corresponded with the times and dates when the DVLA records had been checked.3 In the 
light of these facts, Mr Owens formed the view that a source within DVLA had been supplying 
information  on  request  to  the  detective  agency.4  Further  examination  of  the  documents 
seized revealed that several hundreds of VRMs had been checked by the detective agency, 
and the results sold on to a number of companies and individuals.5

2.3 

These  discoveries  led  to  two  investigations.  The  ICO  commenced  Operation  Motorman 
to investigate data protection offences and, in particular, to identify the customers of the 
agency  who  had  commissioned  the  supply  of  information  and  the  reasons  why  personal 
information  of  this  nature  had  been  sought.6  Thereafter,  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service 
(MPS)  commenced  Operation  Glade  to  identify  potential  corruption  by  police  officers  or 
civilian police employees.7

On closer examination of the documents seized from the premises of Data Research, Mr Owens 
observed that one of the VRM checks had been made against a “protected number”. Having 
previously served as a Special Branch police officer, Mr Owens appreciated that a protected 
number  was  likely  to  signify  a  vehicle  owned  by  a  sensitive  individual  or  an  undercover 
police vehicle. This was confirmed by the MPS and Mr Owens identified Mr Whittamore and 
his company, JJ Services, as having sought the information in relation to this vehicle. As a 
result  of  this,  Mr  Owens  explained,  “Stephen  Whittamore  immediately  went  to  number  1 
on [his] investigation list to be visited and interviewed.”8 The ICO identified Mr Whittamore 
as a private detective running a business from his home address and, as has been explained 
above, on Saturday 8 March 2003, five ICO investigators searched Mr Whittamore’s premises 
pursuant to a search warrant issued under Schedule 9 of the DPA.9

3.	 The	search
3.1 

A  significant  volume  of  documentation  was  seized  during  the  search  of  Mr  Whittamore’s 
premises. This included reports, workbooks, ledgers, invoices and in particular four hardback 
coloured notebooks which have become known as the “Blue book”, “Red book, “Green book” 
and “Yellow book”. These notebooks represented all the work that Mr Whittamore had done, 
and set out precise dealings between Mr Whittamore and his customers, including a number 
of journalists. The workbooks documented who had requested the personal information (both 
in terms of the newspaper concerned and the commissioning journalist), what information 
had been requested and supplied, how much had been charged for obtaining the information 
and how much was paid to associates who assisted in the supply of the information.10 Invoices 
and remittance advices demonstrated the payments made by newspaper groups and how 
much money had been paid for each transaction.11 As Mr Owens explained in his evidence, 
he  was  able  to  demonstrate  a  paper  trail  from  identified  journalists  working  for  named 
newspaper groups, requesting information be obtained, through to the subsequent activities 
of the private investigators using sources or blaggers to obtain the information.12

3.2  Mr  Owens,  assisted  by  ICO  Investigator  Roy  Pollitt,  created  a  photo  image  of  each  of  the 
documents  and  pages  of  the  notebooks,  and  sent  the  documents  to  a  forensic  computer 
specialist to input the information into an electronic database, thus converting the contents 
of Mr Whittamore’s notebooks, invoices, remittance advices into an electronic format. On 30

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil LawE3.3 

November 2011 Mr Owens made a copy of the electronic database available to the Inquiry. Its 
broad accuracy was confirmed when the ICO produced Mr Whittamore’s hardback coloured 
notebooks.

The highly confidential nature of the information contained within the database, and the need 
to protect the privacy of the subjects of the information requested, requires the confidentiality 
of the details of the database to be preserved and the subjects of the requests to remain 
anonymous. Similarly, the journalists who are identified by name in the database, but have 
not  been interviewed or prosecuted by the ICO, have not  been named during  the course 
of the Inquiry. I heard submissions in private as to how to use this material and decided to 
make the database available to the Core Participants of the Inquiry, subject to confidentiality 
undertakings and on strict conditions. The purpose of making the material available was to 
permit Core Participants to evaluate their position in relation to this evidence. In due course 
it was conceded by all Core Participants that I could proceed on the basis that no positive case 
was to be mounted by them that the Motorman material did not reveal prima facie evidence 
of breaches by journalists of the DPA, and I have done so.13 It has not been suggested by any 
Core Participant that, if necessary, I cannot go further and reach my own conclusions based 
on the Motorman evidence as to the culture, practices and ethics of the press.

3.4 

During Mr Owens’ evidence, I observed that the records kept by Mr Whittamore, as illustrated 
in the database, contained, by reference to each request, the name of the newspaper group, 
the newspaper within that group, the journalist’s first and last names, the service requested, 
the name of the person retrieving the information (for example the blagger), the subject about 
whom the information was requested, the result of the search and various accompanying 
comments.14 These aspects of the evidence are now considered in some detail.

Volume of requests made to Mr Whittamore

3.5  Mr Owens expressed the view that the notebooks contained in the region of 17,000 entries, 
or requests for information from the press.15 These requests principally related to activities 
in the period between the end of 2000 and 8 March 2003 when the material was seized by 
the  ICO;  however  the  earliest  entry  was  around  1997.16  Richard  Thomas,  the  Information 
Commissioner at the time, gave evidence that the total number of requests was 13,343.17 
This discrepancy is explained by their different approaches to multiple requests, and need 
not be resolved for present purposes. On any view, the figure involved is substantial, and 
demonstrates that Mr Whittamore was not simply engaged in obtaining the occasional ex-
directory number, or in locating addresses on an infrequent basis, or in supplying personal 
information relating to simply a handful of individuals. Rather, he was engaged in a trade of 

13 Care was taken over this issue which became the subject of some controversy during the hearing and was the 
subject of a ruling: see http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Operation-Motorman-and-
ANL-10-July-2012.pdf. Associated Newspapers Ltd later confirmed that it did not advance a positive case contradicting 
the position that there exists prima facie evidence that journalists did act in breach of s55 by obtaining information 
which, prima facie, could not be justified in the public interest. That group thus fell into line with all other press core 
participants.

Chapter 3 | Operation MotormanEpersonal information relating to hundreds of individual subjects, on an almost daily basis. The 
demand for this information from the press was constant.

3.6 

3.7 

3.8 

Buyers/customers of information
It is important to acknowledge that the buyers or customers of the information were not, by 
any means, exclusively journalists. They included the media, insurance companies, lenders 
and creditors, parties involved in family disputes, criminals with what are likely to have been 
criminal  or  malicious  intentions,  including  witness  and  juror  intimidation,  and  estranged 
couples seeking details of their partner’s whereabouts.18 However, the number of journalists 
requesting  personal  information  from  Mr  Whittamore  (for  whatever  reason,  whether 
justifiable or not) indicates that it was not an isolated incident, or a handful of individuals 
engaging in the practice. The Parliamentary Report, What Price Privacy Now?, identified 333 
journalists as having been named in the Motorman documents, as set out in the table below. 
Mr Thomas’ witness statement identifies some 305 journalists as having been named in the 
Motorman material, and whilst, again, I note the discrepancy between the figures, nothing 
turns on this difference.19

Suppliers of information
The  documents  seized  disclosed  that  the  information  was  either  obtained  directly  by  Mr 
Whittamore, or through associates who would be paid to obtain the information through 
either  blagging  or  paying  a  source.  Mr  Whittamore  would  commonly  outsource  work  to 
associates in return for a payment, and add a premium to the value of the information sold 
to the end buyer.20 One example of a method used to obtain information is illustrated by BT 
ex-directory numbers. One of Mr Whittamore’s associates, Mr Jones, would ring BT or other 
phone companies, purporting to be an engineer; he would use a form of password which is 
given to BT employees (known as an EIN number) in order to identify himself as an engineer. 
Once he had obtained the information sought, he would telephone Mr Whittamore and pass 
on the relevant information. This modus operandi was elicited by Mr Owens from the relevant 
paperwork and by interviewing Mr Jones.21

Subjects of requests for information
Turning to the journalists, the information sought related, in part, to a number of well-known 
celebrities  and  other  figures  in  the  public-eye,  but  equally  included  individuals  who  were 
only remotely connected with public figures, and some who had no obvious newsworthiness 
at all; one, for example was a self-employed painter and decorator who had once worked 
for a lottery winner.22 In his evidence to the Inquiry Mr Owens confirmed that he had seen a 
reference to the Dowler family in the Operation Motorman material alongside a request for

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil LawEan ex-directory telephone number.23 It also emerged in evidence that Mr Hugh Grant was 
amongst the celebrities whose personal information was sought by journalists.

3.9 

Nature of information
The material seized evidenced the supply of a wide range of information including criminal 
record checks against the PNC, occupancy checks, voter searches, directors searches, VRM 
checks and vehicle owner details, ex-directory phone numbers, itemised telephone billing and 
mobile phone records, details of frequently dialled (“friends and family”) numbers, conversion 
of mobile telephone numbers into addresses and vice versa.24 I emphasise immediately that 
at least some of this information could have been obtained lawfully, but that is not the case 
for all the types of information sought.

3.10  By way of example of the type of information requested, in the course of Mr Owens’ evidence 
the  Inquiry  heard  that  one  entry  related  to  a  request  for  specific  calls  from  a  telephone 
number between 16:00hrs and 17:00hrs on a given date. The price for obtaining this type of 
information was £300-£400. Mr Owens expressed the view that this information would be 
available on the subscriber’s telephone bill and this would only be available from the phone 
company.25 Another entry related to a request for a “Phone bill for June 2011” for the price 
of £800.26

3.11  These examples demonstrate that whilst some requests were more general, such as seeking 

to identify where an individual lived, other requests were highly specific in their terms.

Methods of obtaining information

3.12  Within the types of information requested, varying methods were used to obtain the data. 
Thus, by its very nature, it appears clear that some types of information could only have been 
acquired from one possible source, for example the DVLA (VRM checks against owner details), 
the PNC (criminal record checks), or telephone companies (friends and family numbers). As 
Mr Owens explained in relation to friends and family numbers, “there’s no way you can get 
somebody’s list of family and friends lawfully, unless you actually know them and what’s on 
the list. The only way you’ll get them is from BT or whichever phone company”.27 He further 
explained that criminal records checks could also not be obtained lawfully.28 Mr Thomas in his 
evidence also confirmed that the PNC, and the list of friends and family numbers, cannot be 
obtained from information in the public domain.29

3.13  Similarly, in relation to obtaining the vehicle owner’s details from the DVLA, this information 
could  only be obtained lawfully  in a number of specifically defined circumstances set out 
by law. The DVLA has two separate databases holding information: the vehicle register and 
the driver register. The DVLA’s vehicle register holds information about each motor vehicle

Chapter 3 | Operation MotormanE(e.g.  registration  mark,  vehicle  identification  number,  make/model,  emissions,  etc)  and 
includes the name and address of the registered keeper, dates of acquisition and disposal, 
and the vehicle’s tax status. The driver register holds each driver’s name, address, date of 
birth,  photograph,  endorsements,  convictions  and  relevant  medical  information  that  may 
affect a person’s ability to drive. The particulars from the register may be made available in 
a number of particular circumstances, for example to a police officer, or to a local authority 
to investigate an offence.30 It may also be made available to a person who has “reasonable 
cause” for seeking particulars, for example following involvement in an accident, enforcement 
of road traffic legislation or tax collection. It appears very unlikely that requests made to the 
DVLA for owners’ addresses to be supplied to journalists would fall within this category.

3.14  Putting it at its lowest, in respect of these types of information, namely VRMs checks against 
owner details, criminal record checks, or friends and family telephone numbers, I consider 
that the methods used to obtain this information by Mr Whittamore are highly likely to have 
been unlawful.

3.15 

It is right to observe that, in principle, other forms of information, for example addresses, or 
ex-directory numbers, may be obtained through lawful means. For example, one can conceive 
of a laborious check of the full electoral register to identify an address. Similarly, searching 
through former telephone directories to locate a number that may have been notified before 
it became ex-directory may be possible. However, as was explained in What Price Privacy?, 
in many instances the sums charged for such information, for example the obtaining of a 
personal address, appeared to be too low to suggest that extensive hours of research had 
been undertaken to obtain this information. Mr Thomas expressed the view that it was highly 
likely that ex-directory numbers were obtained illegally.31

3.16  News  International  drew  Mr  Thomas’  attention  to  the  fact  that  there  exist  substantial 
databases of telephone numbers which may well have been obtained lawfully: one of the 
largest holds in the region of 50 million numbers, of which approximately 10 million may be 
inferred to be ex-directory.32 However, it does not seem likely that Mr Whittamore had access 
to such a database between 1997 and 2003, and the way in which he recorded the information 
that he obtained does not suggest great computer literacy on his part. Further, it is difficult to 
see why newspapers (which, presumably, could access certain databases themselves) would 
have paid so highly for his services had such databases been his source.

3.17  Taking all this evidence into account, and applying basic common sense to it, the fairly obvious 
conclusion is that Mr Whittamore was obtaining the ex-directory numbers by unlawful means. 
The position is less clear cut in relation to the obtaining of addresses.

3.18 

Public interest
In his evidence Mr Thomas acknowledged that there could, at least in theory, be cases where 
the  public  interest  fully  justified  obtaining  personal  data  (with  the  result  that  no  offence 
would  be  committed);  and  he  also  recognised  that  there  could  be  questions  concerning 
proof of intention or recklessness. In relation to the public interest, he gave the example of 
seeking the weekend telephone number of a minister who had recently resigned in order to

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil LawEcontact him with a proposed story; however, when he was pressed by Mr Rhodri Davies QC 
for News International, he said: “But I have to say yet again, that was not typical, nothing 
like  typical  of  the  cases  that  we  were  seeing.  And  although  you  made  the  point  that  the 
majority of the cases were, in your language, only addresses or phone numbers, I would also 
say the vast majority were nothing to do with public interest considerations along the lines 
I’ve just mentioned.” 33 Mr Thomas expressed the opinion that the evidence obtained as part 
of  Operation  Motorman  did  not  come  near  to  being  characterised  as  being  in  the  public 
interest. He explained, “I haven’t seen a whiff of public interest. It was tittle-tattle. It was 
fishing. There may be one or two examples, but they would be exceptional”.34 I can add that 
no example of a search for the weekend telephone number of a recently resigned minister 
has been shown to me.

3.19  Given that no journalists were ever interviewed by the ICO in relation to Operation Motorman, 
the strength of any public interest defence is difficult to assess definitively and I do not propose 
to do so. However, it was suggested to the Inquiry by at least one press Core Participant that 
the newspaper required access to this data in order to be able to contact the subject of a 
story for his or her version of events; in other words, to facilitate the exercise of a right to 
reply. Expressed in these terms, a public interest defence has superficial attraction, but upon 
closer analysis its strength dissipates. In each case consideration needs to be given to the 
subject matter of the story which is proposed to be published. If the story has a potential 
freestanding  public  interest,  then  it  is  indeed  arguable  that,  subject  to  a  range  of  other 
factors, the journalist might need to contact the subject of the story for his or her account. 
But if, as Mr Thomas has suggested, there is not a whiff of public interest in the underlying 
story, it is not arguable that a public interest can be manufactured for the purposes of the 
defence under s55 of the DPA on the grounds that the subject needs to be contacted.

3.20 

In any event, regard must be paid to the nature of the information commonly being sought by 
journalists. Even assuming a journalist needed to contact the subject of a story, it is difficult to 
imagine why he or she should need to know the telephone details of the family and friends of 
the target. Even more difficult is to see the public interest in deceptively obtaining a criminal 
record check. In those circumstances, it is unlikely that a public interest defence under s55 
of the DPA would have succeeded. Indeed, in only a small minority of the cases is it likely to 
have been even arguable.

Mental element

3.21  The case against a journalist instructing Mr Whittamore to obtain the relevant information is 
slightly different because, in order to establish guilt under s55, the prosecution would have 
to prove to the criminal standard that the journalist in question either knowingly or recklessly 
obtained or disclosed personal data or the information contained in personal data, s55(1)(a), 
or procured the disclosure to another person of the information contained in personal data, 
s55(1)(b). Again, the fact that no journalist was ever interviewed by the ICO renders difficult 
an assessment of whether this mental element could have been proved.

3.22 

It is, of course, possible to draw certain inferences from the available material. That material 
includes, in particular, the type of data sought and obtained, the speed with which it was 
obtained, the amount of money paid for the information in question, and the sheer quantity 
of requests. There is certainly enough here to indicate prima facie (if not at a higher level) that 
many journalists either knew precisely how the information was being obtained or turned a

Chapter 3 | Operation MotormanENelsonian eye to the obvious, or the close to obvious (with the result that there were, at 
least, reasonable prospects of proving recklessness). In that regard, I do no more than accept 
the concession that the press Core Participants made to that effect. It is not possible to go 
further than that, and (notwithstanding that the names of the journalists have not entered 
the public domain) it would be unfair to do so.

4.	 Prosecutions	arising	from	Operation	Motorman
4.1 

The Information Commissioner formed the view that the material obtained during the course 
of Operation Motorman was of sufficient quality and quantity to bring criminal proceedings 
against the private detective Mr Whittamore and his associates involved in the blagging and 
obtaining of personal information. However, the evidence obtained by the ICO overlapped 
to some extent with the material obtained by the MPS and therefore the prosecutions led 
by the CPS in relation to the offences of corruption and conspiracy were given priority, being 
offences of a more serious nature.35

4.2 

4.3 

The evidence discovered by the MPS had highlighted the unauthorised supply of information 
from the PNC by a civilian police employee, and the CPS charged four individuals; namely 
Steve  Whittamore,  John  Boyall,  Alan  King  and  Paul  Marshall  with  corruption  offences. 
19 incidents were covered by the indictment, 12 in respect of Criminal Record Office offences 
and seven in relation to vehicle checks from the PNC. Two of the accused pleaded guilty to 
the corruption charges. On 6 April 2005, the Crown amended the indictment to include two 
offences under the DPA. Mr Whittamore and Mr Boyall pleaded guilty to offences under s55 
of the DPA.36

On 15 April 2005, His Honour Judge Samuels QC, sitting at Blackfriars Crown Court, sentenced 
the four defendants. HHJ Samuels QC stated that: “the vice of the primary conspiracy was to 
make known to the press information which on any view ought to have been confidential, 
and  was  bound  at  its  lowest  to  cause  immense  embarrassment  to  members of  the public 
who  required  the  state  to  maintain  confidentiality  in  their  affairs”.37  However,  the  judge 
considered himself circumscribed by two factors. First, Paul Marshall had already been given 
a conditional discharge at an earlier trial in respect of unrelated offences, his mitigation being 
that he was seriously ill; in the court’s view, Mr Marshall could not now be given a higher 
sentence for a less serious offence, and his co-defendants could not be treated less leniently 
either. Second, the personal circumstances of each of the defendants (as argued before the 
judge) meant that the court considered that it could not impose a fine. Consequently, each 
defendant received a conditional discharge.

4.4 

Separate proceedings under s55 of the DPA had been commenced by the ICO against Mr 
Whittamore and five other private investigators. However, the proceedings were withdrawn 
when the CPS prosecutions resulted in a sentence of a conditional discharge.38 The reasons 
for the discontinuance of the prosecutions are identified in the report What Price Privacy?; 
namely that the ICO was disappointed at the sentences imposed by the court and considered 
that it was not in the public interest to proceed with the ICO’s own prosecutions in these

it cannot be said that this decision was unrealistic.

5.	 Publication	of	Parliamentary	Reports	in	2006
5.1 

In  2006  the  then  Information  Commissioner,  Mr  Thomas,  published  two  Parliamentary 
reports documenting the widespread trade in confidential personal information.40 The report 
What Price Privacy? The unlawful trade in confidential personal information was published 
on 13 May 2006 and the follow-up report What Price Privacy Now? was published  on 13 
December 2006.

5.2 

5.3 

5.4 

What Price Privacy?
The Parliamentary Report published in May 2006 was not the first occasion on which the 
issue  of  the  unlawful  trade  in  personal  information  had  been  debated  or  discussed  in 
public. What Price Privacy? identified three newspaper articles in The Guardian, The Sunday 
Telegraph and The Times, written in the period between September 2002 and January 2003, 
which related to the obtaining of confidential information by private detectives and the sale 
of confidential information from government departments, namely the Inland Revenue, to 
outside  agencies.41  The  report  also  noted  that  the  House  of  Commons  Select  Committee 
on Culture, Media and Sport had conducted an investigation in early 2003 into privacy and 
media intrusion and concluded in its reports that “improper and intrusive gathering of data” 
had appeared in the press and that these methods amounted to a “depressing catalogue of 
deplorable practices”.42

The  first  report  laid  before  Parliament  claimed  to  reveal  evidence  of  systematic  breaches 
of  privacy  that  amounted  to  an  unlawful  trade  of  confidential  personal  information.  The 
purpose  of  the  report  was  to  put  a  stop  to  the  trade  by  proposing  the  introduction  of  a 
custodial sentence for up to two years for persons convicted on indictment, or six months for 
summary convictions.43

Section 5 of What Price Privacy? set out the evidence collated by the ICO which illustrated the 
market in the unlawful supply of personal data. The report explained that: “documents seized 
during Operation Motorman and in other investigations have allowed the ICO to build up a 
clear picture of how the market in unlawful personal data operates. Case details provided 
evidence  of  who  is  buying  the  information  and  why,  and  who  is  obtaining  and  supplying 
the information. We also have some idea of how the suppliers operate and the prices they 
charge.” 44

5.5 

The report analysed the information seized at Mr Whittamore’s premises as falling into two 
categories  of  documentation.  The  primary  documentation  consisted  of  correspondence 
(reports,  invoices,  settlements  of  bills)  between  Mr  Whittamore  and  many  national 
newspapers and magazines, identifying the individual journalist seeking the information. The

secondary documentation consisted of the detective’s own handwritten personal notes and 
a record of work carried out, about whom and for whom.

In relation to methods, the report set out that there were two principal methods of obtaining 
information:  corruption  and  deception.45  Corrupt  practices  included  paying  employees  of 
organisations, for example the DVLA, to access information available to them by virtue of 
their position, whilst deceptive practices included impersonating either the data subject or a 
third party (for example an employee of the same organisation) to obtain the information.46

The report also identified in broad terms a number of individuals who had been interviewed 
as  part  of  the  investigation,  including  celebrities,  professional  footballers  and  managers, 
broadcasters,  a  member  of  the  Royal  Household  and  also  figures  of  less  obvious  public 
interest, including the sister of a partner of a local politician. The report set out the example 
of a mother whose show-business daughter had featured in a number of press stories. Details 
of the mother’s telephone calls and cars owned appeared in Mr Whittamore’s ledgers and 
records  of  financial  transactions.  Further,  a  number  of  those  interviewed  reported  media 
intrusion after personal information had been passed to the press and all were confident that 
they had not willingly supplied the information nor consented to its release.47

Another aspect of the transactions that was analysed in the report was the issue of cost; that 
is to say how much the ultimate customers were charged for personal information and how 
much of this was profit once the agent sourcing the information had been paid. The prices 
charged to journalists ranged from £17.50 for finding an address for a person on the electoral 
roll, to about £70 to search for an ex-directory number, and up to £500 for a criminal record 
check and £750 to obtain mobile account details.48 It seems likely that the figures reflected 
the mode of obtaining the information sought, in particular where other parties, for example 
blaggers, or employees, required payment for their role in the provision of the information.

5.9 

The  total  sum  paid  by  newspapers  for  the  items  of  information  supplied  in  Operation 
Motorman is estimated to be between £300,435 and £547,160.49 This gives an indication that 
the supply of personal information was, for those involved, a lucrative business.

5.10 

In the conclusion of the report, the ICO made a number of extremely pertinent observations:

 “At a time when senior members of the press were publicly congratulating themselves 
for having raised journalistic standards across the industry, many newspapers were 
continuing  to  subscribe  to  an  undercover  economy  devoted  to  obtaining  a  wealth 
of personal information forbidden to them by law. One remarkable fact is how well 
documented this underworld turned out to be”.50
....“The law relating to this offence is perfectly clear... it is framed in a way that applies 
to those who request the disclosure of personal data and those who supply it, including 
any intermediaries in the chain. The problem lies in the inadequacy of the penalties 
which the courts are able to impose”.51

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil LawE5.11  The ICO sought custodial sentences in relation to the commission of offences under s55 DPA 
in order to deter this unlawful trade in information. The ways in which the ICO sought to 
achieve that end are dealt with in Part H of the Report.

What Price Privacy Now?

5.12  The Parliamentary Report What Price Privacy Now? was published to chart the progress in the 
six months following the first report and to set out the responses to the recommendations 
set out in the first report.

5.13  The report noted that a Freedom of Information Act request for further information about 
the 305 journalists identified in the Motorman material and referred to in What Price Privacy? 
had been considered and, on the basis that disclosure of the information was in the public 
interest, the employers of the journalists were set out in tabular form.

5.15  The table sets out a breakdown of the extent to which individual newspapers and magazines 
were implicated in the evidence produced by Operation Motorman and, in particular, the 
number  of  journalists  employed  by  each  newspaper  or  magazine  which  was  identified  as 
having requested the supply of personal information.

5.16 

It is worth underlining the view of the Information Commissioner, as set out in the text of What 
Price Privacy Now?, that the figures in the table do not purport to set out the total number 
of offences committed by journalists, but rather the number of requests made by journalists 
for information. In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Thomas emphasised that it was not being 
said that every single transaction identified was an offence committed by a journalist, but 
rather  that  journalists  were  significant  customers  of  information  which  appeared  to  have 
been obtained illegally.53 However, Mr Thomas also expressed the view that it was likely that 
journalists were committing an offence.54

5.17  Two  overriding  observations  can  be  made  in  relation  to  these  figures.  First,  whilst  the 
journalists engaged in buying personal information supplied through a private investigator 
were employed by a range of titles, including tabloid newspapers, broadsheet newspapers 
and  magazines,  there  is  significant  variation  in  the  extent  to  which  journalists  and  titles 
engaged  in  the  purchase  of  personal  information  from  Mr  Whittamore.  For  example,  58 
journalists from the Daily Mail sought the supply of personal information on 952 occasions, 
whereas by contrast one journalist from The Sunday Times sought the supply of personal 
information  on  four  occasions.  Second,  the  numbers  of  individual  journalists  engaged  in 
purchasing personal information from particular titles is higher than could be put down to 
certain individuals undertaking investigations which might or might not have been known 
about  or  authorised.  Where  dozens,  or  in  some  cases,  over  50  journalists  at  a  particular 
title have sought to purchase personal information, the inference that these practices were 
endemic within particular titles may be readily understood.

6.	 Conclusions
6.1 

For the purposes of responding to a request by Lord Ashcroft under the Freedom of Information 
Act  2000,  ICO  investigation  officers  and  an  in-house  lawyer  analysed  the  source  material 
collated  as  part  of  Operation  Motorman.  They  documented  some  13,343  transactions, 
or  individual  requests  for  information  made  of  Mr  Whittamore.  These  transactions  were

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: The Criminal and Civil LawE6.2 

6.3 

segregated  by  staff  of  the  ICO  into  three  separate  categories  in  terms  of  their  evidential 
value.55 Of these, the ICO took the view that some 5,025 were actively investigated as part 
of  Operation  Motorman  and  positively  known  to  constitute  a  breach  of  the  DPA.  More 
specifically, and put somewhat more carefully, it was the view of a lawyer employed by the 
ICO with extensive involvement in the prosecutions that the evidence in these cases would 
have been sufficient to lead to conviction.56 A number of the requests in this category included 
PNC requests, friends and family requests and some ex-directory requests.57

A  further  6,330  requests  represented  occupancy  searches  and  are  thought  to  have  been 
information obtained from telephone service providers. The ICO considered that the obtaining 
of  this  information  was  likely  to  amount  to  breaches  of  the  DPA;  however,  the  nature  of 
the transactions was not sufficiently known or understood for these to be characterised as 
a positive breach of the DPA, rather than probably illicit transactions.58 Some 1,988 of the 
transactions were considered to lack sufficient identification or understanding of how the 
information had been obtained to determine whether they represented illicit transactions. 
The first category of transactions only was included with the Parliamentary Reports.59

Overall, it is not surprising that the Core Participants made the concessions recorded under 
paragraph  3.3  above:  a  detailed  examination  of  many  individual  examples  would,  in  my 
judgment, undeniably have established that this was the very lowest at which it could be put. 
For reasons which I well understand, the ICO would argue that the concession does not go 
far enough. Without condemning any journalist (none of whom were ever even interviewed 
by the ICO), it is sufficient for me to conclude that, at least in part, what has been revealed 
by some of the Operation Motorman evidence demonstrates an attitude to compliance with 
the law relating to data protection which can only be described as cavalier, if not worse: it is 
certainly revealing of what, at that time at least, were the practices of parts of the press. As 
will become apparent, the extent to which Mr Whittamore’s services continued to be used by 
some titles after his conviction is even more revealing.

Chapter 3 | Operation MotormanEChapter 4 
phone haCking: the expanding impaCt 
of operation Caryatid

1.	
1.1 

Introduction
This  Inquiry  was  ultimately  directed  because  of  the  wide  scale  public  revulsion  at  the 
reported  conduct  of  one  or  more  journalists  from  the  News  of  the  World  (NoTW)  in 
intercepting messages left on the mobile telephone of Milly Dowler: this type of interception 
has  been  referred  to  colloquially  as  phone  hacking.  Having  said  that,  however,  there  was 
also increasing public concern about the apparent lack of appropriate investigation by the 
Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) into the conduct of a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, 
and the extent of the involvement of the NoTW (precipitated by increasing disclosure arising 
out of civil litigation). The consequence (prior to the disclosures about Milly Dowler) was that 
the then Acting Commissioner, Tim Godwin, had re-opened the investigation into the NoTW 
which had started in 2006; substantial resources were devoted to it. Not the least important 
reason for this concern was the increasingly vocal allegation that the relationship between 
senior executives at the NoTW and senior officers at the MPS had influenced or affected the 
direction of the investigation; the allegation itself had the potential to cause serious damage 
to the reputation of the police generally.

1.2 

It is therefore not surprising that the Terms of Reference for Part 1 of the Inquiry specifically 
require it to consider the culture, practices and ethics of the press including contacts with, 
and the relationship between, the press and the police along with the conduct of each. They 
also require recommendations as to how future concerns about press behaviour should be 
dealt with by all the relevant authorities, including the police, the prosecuting and regulatory 
authorities and Parliament.

1.3 

This part of the Report, therefore deals with a wide range of issues including, in relation to 
Operation Caryatid:

E

(b) 

(c) 

(a)  whether the nature of the relationship between the police and the media explains why 
the police did not pursue journalists other than Clive Goodman in 2006 and why the 
investigation was not re-opened following expressed concerns in 2009 and 2010;
the nature and extent of any relationship between News International (NI) and senior 
officers  who  were  or  became  involved  in  this  operation  and  the  extent  (if  at  all)  to 
which any relationship influenced directly or indirectly the way in which operational 
decisions were approached;
in the event that investigating officers or those with an operational role in connection 
with  the  investigation  did  not  themselves  have  any  relevant  relationship,  whether 
knowledge or understanding of the existence of such a relationship between NI and 
their superiors was taken into account when they approached decisions; and;
in order to make recommendations as to the future, the approach and response to the

On the other side of the same investigation, it is also necessary to consider (as part of the 
culture, practices and ethics of the press) the response to the police investigation of NI, the 
Press  Complaints  Commission  (PCC),  and  the  Culture,  Media  and  Sports  Committee  and 
the Home Affairs Committee of the House of Commons. The part played by the PCC also 
deserves detailed consideration in the context of a consideration of the effectiveness of any 
new regulatory regime.

Given the pivotal role that Operation Caryatid has played in the background that has given 
rise to this Inquiry and the focus, in part, on criticisms of the MPS for what is perceived to 
be its failure properly to investigate what emerged from this  investigation, it is necessary 
to  set  out  precisely  what  happened  in  some  detail,  evaluating  decisions  that  were  made 
as they were made and in the light of the prevailing circumstances. That is because I must 
address the allegation that the MPS deliberately held back on a full investigation (and further 
investigation  in  2009  and  2010)  because  of  a  link  with  NI.  In  my  ruling  of  4  May  2012  in 
relation to the operation of rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 to the MPS, I said1:

“If not because of the influence of the press, why did the police not go further with 
Operation Caryatid or investigate the Mulcaire notebook in more detail (particularly as 
a number of officers were concerned that it more than justified further examination)? 
Why was it that the articles in The Guardian and the New York Times were so quickly 
dismissed without further investigation being undertaken? In my judgment, answering 
those questions would be a critical part of the exercise both to assuage the legitimate 
public concern that caused the conduct of the police to be included in the Inquiry in 
the first place but also to justify any conclusions that I reach as to future conduct of 
the relationship between press and police”.

I  concluded  that  answering  these  questions  could  give  rise  to  criticism  and  I  decided  to 
approach the MPS, individual police officers, the CPS and counsel on that basis. Given that 
the statements of a number of police officers used for the Inquiry were those prepared for 
other proceedings, therefore, it is not surprising that, in response to notices under rule 13, 
additional  material  has  been  forthcoming.  I  have  dealt  with  it  in  the  Report  and  directed 
that  additional  statements,  establishing  the  facts  put  before  me,  should  be  provided  and 
treated as part of the evidence of the Inquiry. Where new issues have arisen, I have identified 
them but, in fairness, declined to determine any such issue adverse to any individual: to do 
otherwise would have been to require further rule 13 notices if not further oral hearings.

The complaint
In December 2005, the Royal Household reported to the Royalty Protection Department of 
the MPS that it was concerned that the voicemail messages of Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and 
Helen Asprey, respectively the private and personal secretaries to Princes William and Harry, 
were the subject of unlawful interception. Information had been appearing in the press, in 
particular in the column of Clive Goodman, the Royal editor at the NoTW, which suggested 
knowledge of the content of voicemail messages left on their mobile phones.

The  Head of  the Royalty Protection  Department, Commander  Loughborough,  approached 
Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Specialist Operations) Peter Clarke (now retired) who was 
the head of the anti-terrorism branch of the MPS (then known as SO13). Given the potential 
threat to the safety of members of the Royal Family and the sensitivities surrounding them, 
Mr  Clarke  decided  that  SO13  would  investigate  the  matter  and  would  do  so  covertly  (in

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eorder to avoid alerting potential suspects).2 Mr Clarke sought to safeguard the secrecy of the 
investigation by ensuring only very few officers were aware of it. He explained that the need 
for operational security was one of the factors that weighed in his mind when deciding to 
keep the investigation within SO13,3 where the investigators were developed vetted.

1.9 

Given the code name Operation Caryatid, Mr Clarke had ultimate operational oversight of 
the investigation. He set its parameters and strategy4 and was answerable to the Assistant 
Commissioner (Specialist Operations), Andy Hayman. Mr Hayman has described himself as 
accountable for the investigation but not responsible for day-to-day decision-making,5 nor 
personally  involved  in  formulating  strategy.6  He  received  briefings  from  Mr  Clarke.7  The 
Deputy  Commissioner,  at  the  time,  Sir  Paul  Stephenson,  played  no  apparent  role  in  any 
relevant events in 2005/2006. The then Commissioner, Lord Blair, said that his knowledge of 
the entire investigation was “… limited to short briefings imparted in a few minutes on very 
few occasions …” 8 Lord Blair explained that if those involved had not been members of the 
Royal Family, for whose security he had ultimate responsibility, he would not have expected 
to have been informed of the case at all.9

1.10  The  Senior  Investigating  Officer  (SIO),  Detective  Superintendent  Philip  Williams  (now 
Detective  Chief  Superintendent  (DCS)  Williams),10  was  responsible  for  implementing  the 
strategy set by Mr Clarke, for the daily conduct of the investigation and for providing him 
with regular personal briefings.11 Otherwise, DCS Williams reported to Mr Clarke through his 
senior officers, DCS Tim White and Commander John McDowell.12 By May 2006, Commander 
McDowell was succeeded by Commander Loughborough.

1.11  From 18 April 2006, the Investigating Officer (IO) was Detective Chief Inspector Keith Surtees 
(now DCS Surtees). His role was to deliver the strategy by deciding and putting into effect the 
tactics.13 DCS Surtees also personally briefed Mr Clarke14 and undertook the role of SIO when 
DCS Williams was absent. Towards the end of April 2006, Detective Sergeant Maberly (now a 
Detective Inspector or DI) was appointed the case officer for Operation Caryatid and worked 
with Detective Constable Robert Green (now a Detective Sergeant).15 DI Maberly explained

role was “hands on”, dealing with the evidence as it came in and progressing the case.16

1.12  As standard practice, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees kept a decision log and prepared written 
case reviews. In these contemporaneous documents, the officers recorded key decisions about 
the case including their thoughts about the investigation, the details of periodic reviews and 
their requests for advice from the CPS. Neither Mr Hayman nor Mr Clarke read the decision 
log or case reviews. Mr Clarke explained that he would not have expected to read them but 
was briefed orally throughout the investigation. Mr Clarke was involved in the overall review 
of the decisions made and how the investigation was progressing.17

1.13 

In contrast with the standard practice adopted elsewhere in this Report, this Chapter refers to 
certain documents which are not on the Inquiry website or otherwise in the public domain. 
They are referred to in general terms only with some parts quoted in order to tell the full story. 
The reason is that to publish them in full at this time might prejudice criminal investigations 
and future trials. Although each has been closely examined during the course of the Inquiry, 
therefore, hyperlinked references to these documents cannot be provided.

2.	 The	collection	of	evidence

The covert phase

2.1  Mr  Clarke  defined  the  parameters  of  Operation  Caryatid  as  follows:  to  investigate  the 
unauthorised interception of voicemail messages in the Royal Household; to prosecute those 
responsible if possible; and to take all necessary steps to prevent this type of abuse of the 
telephone system in the future.18

2.2 

2.3 

The first step taken by DCS Williams was to establish whether or not a third party had been 
accessing  the  voicemail  messages  of  Mr  Lowther-Pinkerton  and  Ms  Asprey  without  their 
permission.19 At that stage Vodafone and O2, the respective service providers, maintained 
that they had not appreciated that it was possible to listen to another person’s voicemail 
messages without their knowledge or permission.20 Indeed at that time none of the service 
providers admitted to being aware of this capability.21

The evidence of DCS Williams was that it was only due to the tenacity of DI Kevin Southworth 
(now Detective Superintendent Southworth) who worked with Vodafone and their engineers 
that the police  discovered how mobile  phone  voicemail  systems worked. It was the case, 
apparently,  that  the  service  providers  had  limited  ability  to  establish  precisely  what  was

Nott who spoke about the security ramifications of the messaging system to Vodafone as long ago as 1999 before 
seeking to interest the press, the television and other mobile providers in the issue: http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ehappening  within  any  given  voicemail  system.22  They  could  not,  for  instance,  determine 
whether a voicemail message (whether new or old) existed within a voicemail box at any 
particular time.23 Although it was possible to identify outside or potential “rogue” numbers 
dialling into a person’s voicemail box, the available software could not identify whether or 
not the “rogue” number had listened to any messages.24 They also could not assist with how 
often the illegal access was taking place or how widespread it was.25

By 30 January 2006, with the assistance of Vodafone’s engineers, the police had established 
that a number of outside or potential “rogue” numbers had been calling in to Mr Lowther-
Pinkerton’s voicemail box, using his unique voicemail access number.26 One of those “rogue” 
numbers was traced to Mr Goodman’s home address.27

DCS Williams immediately recognised the possible implications of this apparent vulnerability 
in voicemail systems and recorded in the decision log that they could be quite far reaching 
among the mobile phone service providers.28 It is appropriate to note that he was: “at pains 
to ensure that no one company was singled out as being particularly at risk/fault because to 
an extent, we only knew what we knew from those companies who had software that could 
give an indication of potential interception.”29

Despite acknowledging how widespread the practice was likely to be, DCS Williams maintained 
the focus of the investigation on the Royal Household (not least because the enquiry was still 
in its early stages) with a view to establishing whether what the police had discovered was a 
one-off set of occurrences or something more systematic.30

The police therefore obtained Mr Goodman’s telephone records (or “outgoing call data”) in 
order to ascertain whom he was calling.31

On 9 March 2006 there was a case review meeting involving Mr Clarke, DCS Williams, DCS 
White  and  DCI  Paul  Greenwood.  It  was  decided  at  that  meeting  that  the  lines  of  enquiry 
would remain focussed predominantly on Mr Lowther-Pinkerton’s voicemail box and the link 
to  Mr  Goodman.  As  regards  Mr  Goodman,  the  investigation  was  to  focus  on  establishing 
whether or not he was attempting to access other voicemail accounts and whether or not his 
actions were limited to the Royal Household.32

32 Review of Case dated 9 March 2006 (not published)

274

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE2.9 

On  4  April  2006  DCS  Williams  prepared  a  written  review  of  the  case.33  He  recorded  that 
following an analysis of the outgoing call data from Mr Goodman’s home phone number, five 
to six potential victims, all within the Royal Household, had been identified. The police had 
ascertained that Mr Goodman had been making a significant number of phone calls to Mr 
Lowther-Pinkerton and these other members of the Royal Household over a sustained period 
of time. In the review, DCS Williams indicated that guidance would be sought from the CPS 
in relation to the two main offences that he had identified as arising from Mr Goodman’s 
actions.34

2.10  The first of the two offences about which the police sought advice was unauthorised access to 
computer material contrary to s1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA); this is a summary 
only  offence  attracting  a  maximum  six  months’  imprisonment.  The  second  offence  was 
interception of a telecommunication system contrary to s1 of the Regulation of Investigatory 
Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), an indictable offence attracting a maximum two years’ imprisonment. 
S1(1)(b) of RIPA makes it a criminal offence for a person “intentionally and without lawful 
authority to intercept, at any place in the United Kingdom, any communication in the course 
of its transmission by means of a public telecommunication system”.

2.11  DCS Williams also set out in the review his understanding that the s1 of RIPA offence would not 
be committed unless the interception took place before the intended recipient had listened 
to the message. This has been referred to during the Inquiry by reference to the analogy of 
an “unopened envelope” and as the “narrow interpretation” (the “wide interpretation”, in 
contrast, being that the timing of the interception would be immaterial to the commission of 
the offence so that it would not matter whether or not the intended recipient or anyone else 
entitled to access the voicemail system had done so). He noted that the practice of voicemail 
interception:

“...  was  highly  unlikely  to  be  limited  to  Goodman  alone  and  is  probably  quite 
widespread amongst those who would be interested in such access – a much wider 
security issue within the UK and potentially worldwide”.

2.12  This case review also demonstrated that, at this early stage, DCS Williams was concerned 
about the pressure on resources. He recorded that: “taking this inquiry forward will impact 
on core SO13 operations and the resource implications for a prosecution could be significant.” 
The “resource implications” referred to by DCS Williams in the context of core operations 
conducted by SO13 need hardly be made explicit. The terrorist threat in 2006 remained at 
the  highest  level  and  must  legitimately  have  been  assessed  as  being  at  a  totally  different 
order of priority to voicemail interception.35 At the same time, however, the need to keep 
the investigation secret and the need to maintain the confidence of the Royal Family was 
militating against transferring the investigation out of SO13.

2.13  By 13 April 2006 nine potential victims within the Royal Household had been identified. DCS 
Williams decided that only six of them would be notified that they were potential victims. 
Those  six  included  three  members  of  the  Royal  Family  itself.  DCS  Williams  noted  in  the 
decision log of that day that:

35 paras 5.3-5.5, provide an exposition of the weight of the terrorism investigations which were over-stretching the 
resources of S013 and had required Mr Clarke to “borrow” resources not only from other departments within the MPS 
but other police forces

275

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“… extending the circle of knowledge concerning what is still a highly sensitive covert 
enquiry runs the risk of the nature of the enquiry becoming more publicly known and 
possibly alerting suspect(s), thereby preventing the opportunity for offenders to be 
brought to justice and/or other appropriate security and commercial interests to be 
fully considered once the full facts are known.”

2.14  By 18 April 2006 the investigation had reached a turning point: it was capable of moving into 
a phase of evidence-gathering for the purposes of a prosecution. DCS Williams recorded in 
the decision log that he had raised with Mr Clarke, Commander McDowell and DCS White his 
concern about continuing with the investigation given the pressure on resources:36

“I’m raising to my senior management that if we take this forward to a final prosecution 
and it gets played out in court, given the fact that we are under huge, huge pressure 
in terms of our counter-terrorism operations, how is it right that the anti-terrorist 
branch  is  dedicated  [sic]  investigating  resources  to  something  that  actually  is  not 
terrorism? … Equally, there were valid arguments for why we should retain it.”

2.15  Mr  Clarke  decided  that  the  investigation  would  continue  with  a  view  to  prosecution  and 
would  continue  within  SO13.37  DCS  Williams  therefore  asked  for  and  obtained  additional 
investigative resources.38 DCS Williams explained the stage the investigation had reached as 
follows:39

“My  parameters  remained  in  terms  of  keeping  the  investigation  focused  on  the 
primary victims supported by an uplift in resourcing to enable the evidential gathering 
phase to begin in earnest.”

2.16  DCS Williams gave evidence that when looking ahead to a potential trial, his principal concerns 
were maintaining the confidence of the victims and presenting the case in the clearest and 
most straightforward way possible. He put it in his the statement (prepared for judicial review 
proceedings against the MPS40) that:41

“In terms of securing the confidence and willingness for any ‘victims’ to be willing to 
give evidence in court my strategy was to try to prove the offences based on technical 
evidence  rather  than  bringing  into  a  public  arena  who  might  have  been  leaving 
messages for whom and almost inevitably, what the content of any message might 
be by way of proof it existed. Equally I wanted to be able to present the case in a 
clear and concise manner to ensure the best chance of a successful prosecution and 
thereafter provide the greatest sentencing powers.”

2.17 

In short, DCS Williams was anxious to ensure that the prosecution could be “ring-fenced” 
so as to avoid any member of the Royal Family being placed in the potentially embarrassing 
position  of  giving  evidence  and  to  avoid  the  examination  of  the  actual  content  of  any  of 
the intercepted voicemail messages. In other words, he wished to confine the evidence for 
the prosecution to witness evidence from members of staff within the Royal Household (as 
opposed to members of the Royal Family) and to technical data relating to the interceptions. 
It is not correct to interpret the use by DCS Williams of the term “ring-fence” as an intention 
or attempt to rule out the investigation of other potential victims.

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE2.18  On 20 April 2006 DCS Williams and DCS Surtees had a meeting with Carmen Dowd, Head of 
Special Crime Division at the CPS.42 Ms Dowd was responsible for the provision of legal advice 
in relation to the investigation and eventually for prosecution decisions. At the meeting, DCS 
Williams and DCS Surtees raised the question of how s1 of RIPA should be interpreted. DCS 
Surtees recalled specifically the use of the analogy of the unopened envelope.43 They also 
raised the strategic and presentational question of whether the prosecution could be “ring-
fenced” in the manner described in the paragraph above.44

2.19  On  25  April  2006,  via  email,  Ms  Dowd  provided  the  police  with  preliminary  advice.  She 
indicated  that  both  the  offence  under  s1  of  RIPA  and  the  offence  under  s1  of  CMA  were 
engaged. As for s1 of RIPA, Ms Dowd reserved her position, but gave the provisional indication 
that the “narrow interpretation” was correct. She put it in this way: 45

“… the offences under Section 1 of RIPA, would as far as I can see only relate to such 
messages that had not been previously accessed by the recipient. However, this area 
is very much untested and further consideration will need to be given to this. Again, 
the actual technical evidence would need to be carefully considered before any firm 
view could be taken about whether the offence is capable of being proved. Unless 
the evidence is capable of showing all of the details we discussed (length of original 
message, length of call to recipient’s voicemail etc) it is unlikely that we could proceed 
with the technical evidence alone.”

2.20  Ms Dowd also advised that the prosecution could be “ring-fenced” in order to avoid the need 
for a member of the Royal Family to give evidence. Finally, it is correct to point out that in 
the context of this preliminary advice Ms Dowd did not mention the possibility of charging 
the inchoate offence of conspiracy under the Criminal Law Act 1977, or the consequences 
of  relying  on  an  agreement  to  intercept  messages  which  would  not  require  proof  of  an 
“unopened envelope”.

2.21  There is no sensible basis for suggesting that this provisional legal advice, given by Ms Dowd, 
on the interpretation of s1 of RIPA was influenced by any concern about offending NI and I 
have no doubt that it was not. The fact that her initial view as to the proper interpretation 
of s1 RIPA may not have been right therefore throws no light on the conduct of the police 
and the press. However, it is important to consider whether the fact that this initial view was 
provided goes some way to explaining the apparent restraint shown by the MPS in limiting 
the scope of the investigation. This preliminary advice certainly led DCS Williams to direct the 
investigation towards obtaining technical evidence that the suspect was accessing voicemail 
messages before the intended recipient. In the words of DCS Williams:46

“This was my understanding of the law from the beginning of the enquiry, it was a 
key question put to the CPS which they confirmed as being correct and thereafter it 
was central to all our activity in terms of securing best evidence including the use of 
an expert witness. If at any time the advice had been otherwise I would not have had

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eto go the lengths I went to, to both shape the investigation and identify any ‘potential 
victims’ of this form of criminality.”

2.22  To this extent, therefore, this initial advice did have a causative bearing on the subsequent 
course of the police investigation and it will be necessary to consider any continued impact it 
might have had as time passed. In the light of Ms Dowd’s advice, however, the police cannot 
be criticised for adopting the investigative approach described by DCS Williams. It goes further 
because it would have been irresponsible to ignore it, the risk being that, unless the allegation 
of conspiracy was brought into play, they would fall at the first hurdle of any prosecution 
under  s1  of  RIPA  should  the  court  subsequently  conclude  that  this  narrow  interpretation 
was correct without there being evidence that the “envelope” had been unopened when 
accessed by the accused. Although the CPS had been careful to advise that the CMA was an 
alternative statutory recourse, if the police wished to keep both legal avenues open in line 
with CPS advice it was necessary to obtain this specific evidence.

2.23  Simply as a matter of chronology, it is worth noting that, on 25 April 2006, Andy Hayman met 
Andy Coulson and Neil Wallis (then Editor and Deputy Editor of NoTW) with Dick Fedorcio. At 
this stage, there was no evidence in the hands of the police that any NoTW journalist (other 
than Mr Goodman) was implicated in voicemail interception. All have said that the issue of 
voicemail interception (still in its covert phase) was not discussed on that occasion, and as Mr 
Garnham QC was able to develop in argument, an examination of the chronology of decision 
making  within  the  MPS  at  this  point  demonstrates  that  nothing  discussed  at  that  dinner 
could have resulted in any favour shown to NI.47 In the circumstances, although I understand 
why it is contended that the contrary cannot be excluded, I am satisfied that the police did 
nothing to alert the editors as to what was going on: it does, however, serve to underline 
the importance of care in relation to contacts with any organisation an employee of which is 
being investigated simply because of the perception that favours could be exchanged.

2.24  The story moves on to 9 May 2006 when DCS Williams recorded in an “Enquiry Update”48 that 
the police had discovered another potential suspect, a “Paul Williams” (which transpired to 
be an alias used by Mr Mulcaire).49 In the course of its own internal enquiry O2 had traced 
audio recordings of a man calling himself “Paul Williams” phoning O2 customer services and 
asking for pin numbers for voicemail accounts to be re-set to default settings. He held himself 
out  as  an  O2  employee who  was  authorised  to  have  access  to  customer  information  and 
to make such requests. O2 discovered that on two occasions “Paul Williams” asked for Ms 
Asprey’s pin number to be reset to default, and that this had been carried out.

2.25 

In the update DCS Williams set out three options to be considered by the senior management. 
Option  one  was  that  there  be  no  further  investigation  with  the  intention  of  prosecution. 
Option  two  was  to  hand  over  the  investigation  to  another  police  unit;  option  three  was 
to commence a formal investigation to prosecute those intercepting the Royal Household 
voicemail  messages  and  “in  tandem  with  the  above  establish  whether  or  not  there  are 
evidential links to the potentially wider unauthorised intrusion/access suspected by O2”. He 
recommended the third option over the short-term, and provided a very perceptive rationale 
in this way:

“… we have discovered a vulnerability that exists within the mobile telephone industry 
whereby unscrupulous people could intrude upon the privacy of the vast majority of

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEthe public through unauthorised access to voicemail. I suspect that the media world 
may well be aware of this vulnerability and there may well be a host of people using 
this  vulnerability  for  journalistic  purposes.  The  Goodman  connection  is  potentially 
an example of this, but the more sinister side would be that the knowledge could 
equally be utilised by criminals whether that be in the general sense, for terrorism 
or to threaten national security. Therefore I believe that this matter has a significant 
public interest aspect to it particularly in terms of safety and security and risk to life.”

2.26  DCS Williams recorded at the end of the update that its contents had been briefed to DCS 
White and Commander Loughborough and that he had been advised that the enquiry would 
remain within SO13 for the time being. In line with the preliminary advice from the CPS, he 
then set about deciding how best to prove the interception of voicemail messages before 
they  had  been  heard  by  the  intended  recipient.  DCS  Williams  decided  to  mount  what  he 
termed a “sting operation” (although this is a misnomer because the operation did not involve 
deception) which amounted to allocating a test period over around three weeks in May and 
June 2006 during which the relevant activity on the mobile phones of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton 
and Ms Asprey would be monitored.50

2.27  With DCS Williams working abroad between 12 May and 5 June 2006, DCS Surtees oversaw 
this  aspect of  the operation  the aim of which  was to prove who  was accessing messages 
and to obtain evidence to establish that after a voicemail message had been left, the same 
message was illicitly accessed before it was heard by the intended recipient.51 During this 
test, Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey were asked to retrieve their voicemail messages 
only at set times twice in every 24 hour period. Where either came across a message that was 
marked as an old message, but which he or she had not previously listened to, this prompted 
further investigation.52

2.28  Part of the strategy for the operation was to ascertain whether the service providers had the 
software capability to detect both the fact that a message had been left and the retrieval 
of unheard messages by one of the rogue numbers.53 It transpired that it was only through 
Vodafone’s “Vampire” data that the police could definitively prove the sequence of person 
A  leaving  a  message  on  person  B’s  voicemail  and  person  C  dialling  in  and  retrieving  the 
message.54 DI Maberly explained that “Vampire” data was an engineering or diagnostic tool 
used by Vodafone to monitor how its systems were running, including its voicemail systems. 
In the process of monitoring the systems, it captured data relating to customers’ accounts, 
including when a voicemail message was left and when it was opened. However, this data 
was not retained for very long and so Vodafone needed to “harvest it” on a regular basis.55 DI 
Maberly had the impression that it would only exist for a matter of days or maybe a couple 
of weeks.56

2.29  Where “Vampire” data was not available, the fact that a voicemail message had been accessed 
had to be deduced from the length of the incoming call to the voicemail box. The telephone 
expert for the prosecution, David Bristowe, explained that the call would need to be at least

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E10 to 14 seconds long owing to the length of the recorded message which the caller would 
have heard before accessing the voicemail message.57 Therefore, where a call was at least 
10 to 14 seconds in length, it could be inferred that the caller had listened to a voicemail 
message.58

2.30  During the same period, the police carried out a surveillance operation on the home address 
of Mr Goodman. The purpose was to prove that the telephone was in Mr Goodman’s hand at 
the time of any relevant calls from that number into the voicemail systems being monitored.59

2.31  On 15 May 2006 O2 informed the police that they had identified and contacted a number 
of customers whose voicemail accounts had potentially been accessed unlawfully. Two such 
customers, Max Clifford and “HJK”60 had asked that the police be informed.61 This was highly 
significant because these potential victims were not members of the Royal Household and 
therefore  would  not  ostensibly  have  been  of  any  interest  to  Mr  Goodman  (although  the 
NoTW was later to argue that Mr Goodman had a wider remit than the Royal Household). At 
around the same time, other service providers also gave the police details of possible victims 
although all but a very small number were linked to the Royal Household.62

2.32  On 30 May 2006 Ms Dowd prepared a briefing on the current status of the investigation for 
the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who at that time was Ken Macdonald QC (now Lord 
Macdonald QC of River Glaven), and for the Attorney General.63 This was conventional in any 
case involving members of the Royal Family. In the briefing Ms Dowd explained the legal and 
technical issues, and stated:

“… in addition to Goodman, another potential suspect has been identified as accessing 
the UVM’s [sic] on a number of occasions and inquiries continue in relation to him. 
I  am  told  that  in  the  media  world  he  is  widely  suspected  of  being  able  to  access 
mobiles … A vast number of UVM’s belonging to high profile individuals (politicians 
and celebrities) have been identified as being accessed without authority – these may 
be the subject of a wider investigation in due course. A number of the targets of these 
unauthorised accesses have been informed – some of whom have declined to assist 
in a police investigation.”

Lord Macdonald QC asked to be kept closely informed.64 He was not asked to give an opinion 
on the case and he said it would have been surprising if he had been asked to do so.65

2.33  On 31 May 2006 DCS Surtees prepared a written update on the investigation.66 As the briefing 
given  by  Ms  Dowd  to  the  DPP  indicated,  the  police  had  by  then  ascertained  that  one  of 
the “rogue” numbers accessing the voicemail boxes of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey 
belonged to Mr Mulcaire. DCS Surtees identified the possibility that Mr Mulcaire and Paul 
Williams were one and the same person. The update referred to Max Clifford and “HJK” and

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEsuggested that the investigation into potential victims outside the Royal Household should 
be taken over by a team outside the anti-terrorist branch. Pursuing his recommendation that 
the wider investigation should be undertaken by a different team, he also recorded that he 
had briefed the relevant officers.

2.34  Mr Clarke decided to keep the investigation within the anti-terrorist branch and not to widen 

the original parameters of the investigation.67 Mr Clarke described his thinking as follows:68

“As  the  investigation  progressed  it  became  clear  that  there  may  have  been  many 
other people being targeted by whoever was responsible for the interception, and 
there was potential for the investigation to become much wider. I took the decision 
that this was not appropriate for a number of reasons. In coming to the decision that 
the parameters of the investigation had to remain tightly drawn it was obvious to me 
that a wider investigation would inevitably take much longer to complete. This would 
carry two unacceptable risks. First, that the investigation would be compromised and 
evidence lost and second, that the much wider range of people who we were learning 
were becoming the victims of this activity would continue to be victimised while the 
investigation took its course. This would probably go on for many months and to my 
mind this would be unacceptable.”

2.35  Mr Clarke rejected the option of informing the victims, in confidence. This was to enable the 

investigation to continue:69

“It  was  not  feasible  to  notify  victims  and  continue  with  a  wide  ranging  covert 
investigation,  and  if  we  had  done  so,  it  is  inconceivable  that  the  fact  that  there 
was an enquiry into this matter would not have leaked, thereby compromising the 
investigation and leading to the potential loss of evidence.”

2.36  Mr Clarke agreed that this decision not to widen the parameters of the investigation was 
probably made on or shortly after 31 May 2006 when DCS Surtees briefed him on the potential 
breadth of the investigation.70 His evidence was that, when it was becoming clear that the 
police were looking at something endemic within a particular part of the media and that 
there were more victims than they originally thought, he did seriously consider transferring 
the investigation from SO13 to a different department. He explained:71

“...Initially  it  was  because  by  that  stage  my  officers  were  very  familiar  with  the 
quite complicated technical aspects of this offence…They had also engendered the 
confidence of the royal household in the way in which they were conducting themselves 
and the investigation, and because of the wider nature of what was happening, it 
would have meant picking apart the investigation and perhaps hiving off one part to 
one department, keeping another part with us, and that would have not made any 
sort of operational sense. So at that stage I decided it should stay where it was.”

2.37 

In  evidence  DCS  Surtees  said  that  it  was  a  “fair  observation”  that  it  might  be  difficult 
to  disentangle  an  investigation  involving  offences  against  the  Royal  Household  from  an 
investigation  involving  other  victims.72  As  a  result,  the  police  strategy  was  to  continue 
concentrating on arresting and prosecuting Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and not (in the

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ewords of DCS Surtees): “to delay this exercise in favour of identifying a multitude of victims to 
load a future indictment…”73 He explained his biggest fear was that:74

“… sensitive state visits by principle [sic] members of the Royal Family to areas such 
as Iraq or Afghanistan could be leaked with the obvious security risks associated with 
such knowledge, whilst a trawl for victims continued.”

2.38  On  21  June  2006,  DCS  Williams  prepared  a  further  written  update.75  He  recorded  that 
through an analysis of the Vodafone “Vampire” data gathered during what he termed the 
“sting  operation”,  the  police  had  identified  two  voicemail  “interceptions”  in  the  “narrow” 
sense76 by Mr Goodman and two by a phone number which was subsequently attributed 
to  Mr  Mulcaire.77  He  described  this  as  “a  moment  of  reflection”  during  which  he  put  the 
operation  in  its  context.78  DCS  Williams  concluded  by  setting  out  his  concerns  about  the 
strain on resources caused by the burgeoning number of SO13 anti-terrorist operations and 
the need, given the limited resources available, for a proportionate approach to Operation 
Caryatid:79

“At the moment I consider that I have enough resources to continue with this enquiry 
in  terms  of  what  is  currently  required,  however  I  believe  that  it  is  important  to 
formally  record  that  this  investigation  has  been  conducted  against  a  backdrop  of 
sustained and increasing workload for SO13 since at least December 2005. Over that 
period the number of operations has increased from numbers in the 50’s to today at 
tasking where we have reached 72 active operations with a number of them posing 
significant life threatening risks. Today again at tasking, as in previous weeks, there 
were requests for additional resource with there no longer being any spare capacity. 
This has resulted in some lower priority anti terrorist operations being placed on hold 
to release officers to higher priority operations. The level of the current workload is 
unprecedented and the assessment for the future is that this is unlikely to ease.
“Operation Caryatid has been brought to its current status against this backdrop and 
the  need  to  balance  resources  against  all  anti  terrorist  operations.  Subject  to  the 
stages outlined above the scope of any future overt operational activity e.g. arrest/
searches  will  need  to  be  balanced  against  the  whole  of  SO13/CT  priorities.  These 
comments  are  documented  purely  to  reinforce  how  my  decision-making  has  been 
reached in terms of how to approach this enquiry in a proportionate manner.”

2.39  Meanwhile,  the  service  providers  continued  to  identify  previously  undiscovered  potential 
victims.80 The decision not to widen the investigation was, however, maintained. On 6 July 
2006 DCS Surtees noted in the decision log that he was aware that there were potentially 
numerous  victims,  at  the  hands  of  Mr  Goodman  and  Mr  Mulcaire  or  others,  but  that 
identifying all those victims would be “hugely time consuming”.81 In the context of what was 
later to happen (both at the conclusion of the prosecution and during the years that followed

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEwhen concerns  were being  expressed about  the way in  which  the investigation  had  been 
conducted), this is an important observation.

2.40  On 30 June 2006 the police prepared a written request for advice from the CPS.82 The police 

informed the CPS that the telephone evidence indicated that:

(a) 

between 26 January 2005 and  24 April  2006 Mr Goodman’s landline  had  called  the 
unique voicemail access numbers of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton and Ms Asprey 145 times 
and 107 times respectively;

(b)  between 22 February 2006 and 8 May 2006 a landline located in the offices of NI had 

(c) 

(d) 

called Ms Asprey’s unique voicemail access number;
in May 2006 a landline number registered to an office leased by Mr Mulcaire had called 
the  unique  voicemail  access  numbers  of  Mr  Lowther-Pinkerton  and  Ms  Asprey  five 
times and 38 times respectively; and
the number relating to Mr Mulcaire’s office premises had called Mr Goodman’s mobile 
phone a number of times.

2.41  On 14 July 2006, before the CPS responded to this request for advice from the police, Ms 
Dowd sent another confidential briefing note to the DPP and the Attorney General.83 Lord 
Macdonald agreed that the briefing was premised on the narrow interpretation of s1 of RIPA.84 
However, Ms Dowd expressed the view that offences of conspiracy between Mr Goodman 
and Mr Mulcaire to commit s1 of RIPA and s1 of CMA offences “may better reflect the alleged 
criminality involved and enable a more comprehensive case to be presented”.85

2.42  On 18 July 2006 Ms Dowd advised the police in writing. She advised that the case against Mr 
Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, at that stage limited to the Royal Household interceptions, was 
“cogent and presentable and could proceed without the need to delve into the content of any 
messages left and/or retrieved”.86 She also stated that:87

“Whilst there are many aspects of the evidence which I would require to be clarified, it 
is my initial assessment that offences under the CMA and RIPA 2000 may be provable. 
However, in addition, I would also be looking to consider an offence of conspiracy to 
commit those offences on the basis of other evidence being available …”

2.43 

It is correct to observe that this was the first occasion on which the possibility of the criminality 
being accommodated within the offence of conspiracy was mentioned by the CPS. As Lord 
Macdonald  pointed  out  in  evidence,  and  reflected  above,  a  charge  of  conspiracy  would 
not require proof that every interception had taken place before it had been accessed by 
the intended recipient:88 indeed, given that the offence was constituted by the agreement 
rather than by the subsequent act or acts, it would probably be sufficient to prove a common

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eintention  to  intercept  voicemail  messages  without  examining  exactly  when  such  multiple 
accessing would be taking place.

2.44  Also on 20 July 2006 DCS Williams prepared a further written update on the investigation.89 
He  noted  that:  “there  may  well  be  a  much  wider  range  of  ‘victims’  and  indeed  I  suspect 
that Mulcaire could well be someone whose business it is to secure access to information 
concerning a whole range of ‘VIPs’”. Identifying the options, again he included:

“extend[ing] the investigation to include the full extent of this potential criminality which 
would help to establish the seriousness of what we are facing.”

but he went on:

“However, to do this effectively the enquiry would probably have to remain covert, 
which would leave my known and unknown victims vulnerable over a much greater 
period  of  time.  It  would  also  require  significant  SO13  resources  and  the  current 
terrorist threat requires their deployment elsewhere against much higher threats to 
public safety/life.”

2.45  Because of this, DCS Williams was of the view that Operation Caryatid should remain limited 
to  victims  within  the  Royal  Household  but  that  Mr  Goodman  and  Mr  Mulcaire  should  be 
arrested  as  soon  as  possible  in  order  to  curtail  the  exposure  of  the  victims  to  voicemail 
interception. DCS Williams also had in mind that including more victims would be unlikely 
to increase significantly the sentence that the offenders would receive; and that securing a 
conviction as a deterrent to others would be best achieved through a clear and simple case. 
He set out that the alternative to limiting Operation Caryatid would be:

“…  a  much  extended  trial,  numerous  victim’s  [sic],  potentially  more  suspects  with 
a  host  of  council  [sic]  all  seeking  to  derail  what  could  appear  to  be  a  far  more 
complicated case ...
[whereas] “Once executive action is taken then all parties can be briefed re the security 
issues and the phone companies can start to put in appropriate security measures 
and brief/reassure their customers – all of which will reduce public/personal harm ...”

2.46 

In the same update of 20 July 2006, DCS Williams also listed the factors which influenced 
his view that the investigation should not be transferred out of SO13. His list included the 
following:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 
(d) 

(e) 

that the support of the Royal Household was strongly based on the confidence it had in 
SO13;
that the relationships formed between SO13 and the service providers were crucial to 
a successful prosecution;
the importance of continuity of the investigation;
that delays would be caused by transferring the investigation to another department 
because a new SIO would need to review the case and may have resource constraints 
that might further delay the operation.
the  current  team’s  intimate  knowledge  of  the  case,  which  could  not  realistically  be 
picked up in the same detail by a new team.

284

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE2.47  DCS Williams sought strategic guidance on this approach from Mr Clarke, who endorsed his 
view.90 He then went on  leave until 12 August 2006 so it fell to DCS  Surtees to deal with 
information received on 26 July 2006 to the effect that Mr Mulcaire had accessed the voicemail 
of Tessa Jowell, then a cabinet minister. DCS Surtees then noted in the decision log:91

“As a result the position is that this changes the perception that as well as the Royal 
Correspondent of the N.O.W filling up his editorial with Royal gossip the potential for 
operational Security breaches now not only surrounds the Royal household but also 
Cabinet Ministers.”

When giving evidence, DCS Surtees agreed that his primary concern was then to stop the 
voicemail interception in the interests of national security. 92

2.48  On 2 August 2006 Ms Dowd discussed the case with leading counsel, David Perry QC. Mr 
Perry agreed during his evidence that the advice he gave was essentially that, first, there was 
evidence in respect of four main substantive offences93 which established in any event that 
the interception had taken place before the intended recipient had accessed the voicemail 
message concerned; and second, that in relation to the conspiracy charge, the issues about 
whether or not there needed to be an “unopened envelope” would not arise.94

2.49  Mr Perry explained in his evidence that he also advised against charging Mr Mulcaire and Mr 
Goodman with CMA offences because asking a jury to deal with those allegations together 
with s1 of RIPA would be confusing;95 furthermore, s1 of RIPA more accurately reflected the 
conduct concerned.96 Mr Perry also advised as to the possibility of obtaining a warrant under 
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and the attendant difficulties which would 
arise in relation to journalistic material.97

2.50  The only record that exists of the meeting on 2 August 2006 is an email sent by Ms Dowd to 
the police on that day.98 On the question of the interpretation of s1 of RIPA, Ms Dowd said 
the following in the email:

“We have briefly discussed before the possibility of arguing that what we have termed 
our Computer Misuse Act offences might fall to be considered as RIPA offences – that 
the issue has not definitively been argued. I was reticent about arguing the point in 
this case. However, having considered the matter with Counsel we have concluded 
that we could properly argue the point – and in any event nothing would be lost as 
we already have the 4 main clear RIPA offences (if not more I hear!).”

2.51  As regards Ms Dowd’s use of the words “if not more I hear”, DCS Surtees was asked whether 
this  was  a  reference to  the  possibility, at  least, of  additional  co-conspirators.  DCS  Surtees 
disagreed and said that:99

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“I  think  it’s  more  …  that  we’ve  got  more  information/evidence  coming  from  the 
telephone companies to talk about access to DDNs and the sequencing which we’re 
concentrating on as opposed to more suspects.”

2.52  Pausing in the narrative, it is appropriate to comment on the approach of the police to the 
gathering of evidence and to the strategic decisions that were taken, particularly against the 
context of the concern that this approach was or could have been affected by the relationship 
between the MPS or its most senior officers and NI. The first point to make is that there is 
no evidence (or even the slightest suggestion) of any relationship between NI, the NoTW 
or any of its employees and any officers involved in this enquiry from the Deputy Assistant 
Commissioner  (Mr  Clarke)  down  through  the  detective  ranks.  Whilst  each,  as  their  roles 
required, will have interacted with individuals from NI at certain times during their careers, 
they did not form social relationships. Mr Clarke gave evidence as to his level of interaction with 
individuals from NI, which, in spite of his senior position and high-profile role, was extremely 
limited. To the best of his knowledge he had never met or even spoken to Neil Wallis or Colin 
Myler (editor of the NoTW between the end of January 2007 and July 2011). He met Rebekah 
Brooks and Andy Coulson on one occasion in 2004. The purpose of that meeting was to make 
the media aware of the reality of the terrorist threat because there had been a great deal 
of criticism in the media of the counter-terrorism effort and some commentators had been 
saying that the terrorist threat was being exaggerated by the authorities for political or self-
serving purposes.100 At the meeting, they were unexpectedly (at least to Mr Clarke) joined by 
Rupert Murdoch.101

2.53  The only known relationship was with Mr Clarke’s senior officer, Mr Hayman, and the occasions 
in respect of which there is evidence of contact with NI in the relevant period will be clear; 
there is no basis for suggesting that Mr Hayman was any more than peripherally involved in 
the investigation; to such extent as he was involved in any way, it was solely because of his 
responsibilities for overall command of Mr Clarke’s team. Neither do I believe that Mr Clarke 
or any of the other officers were or would have been affected by any such relationship.

2.54  The peripheral nature of the involvement of Mr Hayman is illustrated by his evidence and 
that of Mr Clarke. The evidence of Mr Hayman is that he allocated the investigation to Mr 
Clarke, asked him to devise an investigation strategy and an operation,102 and let him “get on 
with it”. Mr Hayman only expected Mr Clarke to refer to him if Mr Clarke considered there 
was  something  that  Mr  Hayman  needed  to  brief  up  to  the  Commissioner  or  if  Mr  Clarke 
had insufficient resources.103 Mr Hayman stressed that he was not involved in the detail of 
Operation Caryatid and stated that his degree of detachment was demonstrated by the fact 
that he did not know when the arrests or searches were going to take place.104 Mr Hayman 
told the Inquiry that he could count on one hand the number of times he and Mr Clarke spoke 
about the investigation.105

2.55  Mr Clarke, in general agreement with the extent to which Mr Hayman had contact with him on 
this issue said that he personally would have briefed Mr Hayman “probably not very often”.106 
Mr Clarke could not remember specifically which issues he discussed with Mr Hayman except

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEthat he certainly briefed Mr Hayman at the outset when it was discovered that Mr Goodman 
and Mr Mulcaire appeared to be responsible and “probably … in the run-up to the arrest 
phase”.107 It is clear, therefore, that Mr Hayman did not make any operational decisions and 
did not influence relevant decision-making, save to the extent that he did not disagree with 
any of the decisions made by Mr Clarke.108

2.56  Moving on, I am entirely satisfied that each of the decisions taken was justified and based 
on reasoning that was clear, rational and entirely in keeping with the operational imperatives 
of the police at that time. I recognise that the decision (which was revisited on a number of 
occasions) not to expand the investigation beyond the Royal Household gives rise to concern 
but there is no basis for arguing that it was based on oblique motives consequent on any 
relationship  with  NI.  Again,  in  the  light  of  the  circumstances  prevailing  (especially  related 
to the extensive demands on police time in relation to terrorism), it was understandable, 
justified and appropriate.

2.57  Elaborating on the reasons for these conclusions, it is clear that during the pre-arrest phase 
of the investigation DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and, indeed, Mr Clarke were aware that there 
could be a wide range of other victims but that the priority which needed to be given to counter 
terrorism, the need for secrecy and the belief that arresting Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire 
would send out the strongest signal and bring this criminality to an end all militated against 
expansion. The contemporaneous decision logs and case reviews identify this reasoning; DCS 
Williams spoke of the process as involving “a balance of risk and harm” which would be judged 
in particular against the imminence of a threat to life and it is equally clear that judgements 
continued to be made throughout this time on that basis.109 Such a decision, however, does 
leave open the need to devise, institute and execute an appropriate exit strategy. All these 
decisions were re-visited after the operation moved through the arrest and prosecution phases 
and require re-examination as the extent of the evidence came to be known whereupon the 
need  for  an  exit  strategy  to  deal  with  the  unresolved  issues  surrounding  the  investigation 
became all the more pressing. It is to these phases that I now turn.

The arrest and searches

2.58  On 8 August 2006, the police arrested Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire and searched over 
13 premises and vehicles, including their home addresses.110 Attempts were also made to 
search the offices of NI in Wapping111 although to minimise the risk of encountering journalistic 
material, the CPS had advised that the search of those premises should be confined to Mr 
Goodman’s desk and the finance offices.112 The objectives of the search included looking for 
evidence implicating other NoTW journalists. DCS Surtees explained:113

“The  intention  behind  searching  the  offices  of  News  Corporation  was  to  seize  all 
material  relating  to  Clive  Goodman  and  Glenn  Mulcaire  to  establish  the  extent  of 
their unlawful practises [sic] and also to establish the level of knowledge of NOTW 
concerning this illegal activity. At no point was a decision made by D/Supt Williams

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eor I to not investigate the wider possible involvement of NOTW. Despite the legislative 
challenges  to  searching  journalistic  premises,  the  warrant  would  be  executed  as  I 
was eager to gain entry to the offices of NOTW for two reasons: The first was to seek 
and recover any additional evidence relevant to Clive Goodman’s activities and the 
second was to ascertain whether any other evidence existed implicating others within 
the NOTW in a wider conspiracy, hence my reference on application for the section 8 
PACE warrant to the financial office.”

2.59  DI Maberly explained that the police intended to seize records relating to financial payments 
to Mr Mulcaire (including documents recording the dates of such payments, the reasons for 
the payments and those authorising the payments) and plans or directories relating to the 
locations of telephone extensions within the offices.114

2.60 

It is significant and a matter of regret that the plans for the search were substantially thwarted. 
DCS Surtees described how the searching officers were obstructed by NI personnel:115

“There  was  some  real  difficulty  in  conducting  the  search  at  News  International. 
There were I think four of my officers who actually got into the premises before News 
International barred the rest of my officers from going into News International. We 
got to the desk of Goodman, we seized some material from the desk of Goodman. 
There  was  a  safe  on  his  desk,  which  was  unopened.  My  officers  were  confronted 
with photographers, who were summonsed from other parts of News International, 
and they were taking photographs of the officers. A number of night or news editors 
challenged the officers around the illegality of their entry into News International. 
They were asked to go to a conference room until lawyers could arrive to challenge 
the illegality of the section 18(1) and 18(5) and section 8 PACE authorities, and it was 
described to me as a tense stand-off by the officer leading the search.
“The officer tried to get our forensic management team, our search officers into the 
building. They were refused entry, they were left outside. Our officers were effectively 
surrounded  and  photographed  and  not  assisted  in  any  way,  shape  or  form.  That 
search was curtailed. Some items were taken. The search did not go to the extent I 
wanted it to.”

2.61  On  being  informed  of  the  level  of  obstruction,  DCS  Surtees,  who  was  not  present  at  the 
search, instructed the small team to search Mr Goodman’s desk only and leave the premises 
with whatever they had recovered.116 A locked safe and computer had to be left behind. The 
financial records were not searched.

2.62  No  subsequent  search  (with  a  larger  team  of  police  officers)  was  arranged.  DCS  Surtees 
explained:  “I  think  the  moment  had  been  lost  with  regard  to  the  information  we  sought. 
It, I think, had gone, quite frankly”. He agreed that what he meant was that NI might have 
hidden or destroyed incriminating information.117 This is a disturbing conclusion and justifies 
a re-evaluation of the way in which PACE operates when seeking to deal with allegations of 
criminal conduct by journalists while at the same time protecting the essential requirements 
of a free press.118

288

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE2.63  The search of Mr Mulcaire’s home and business premises was very much more successful: 
the police seized some 11,000 pages of papers. These papers have been referred to in various 
ways including as “Mulcaire’s notebook” and “the Mulcaire archive” and, in part, consisted 
of lists of names, with addresses, landline and mobile phone numbers; in some cases, there 
were unique voicemail access numbers and pin numbers along with contact details for the 
network service provider. Additionally, of potential importance was a first name in the top 
left hand corner of the page. In a number of cases in respect of which Mr Goodman was later 
prosecuted, that name or “corner name” (as it has since been termed) was “Clive”. Given the 
present status of the investigation and prosecution of journalists in relation to this material, 
it is not appropriate to go further.

2.64  What can be added is that the 11,000 pages of documents included what has since been 
described as the “for Neville” email.119 This email (dated 29 June 2005) was apparently sent by 
Ross Hindley at the NoTW, to Mr Mulcaire, and is entitled ‘Transcript for Neville: Wednesday, 
June 29 2005’. The message read:

“Hello,  
This is the transcript for Neville. I have copied the text in the below email, and also 
attached the file as a word document.
Ross.
TRANSCRIPT FOR NEVILLE: WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29 2005.”

Then, set out in the body of the email is the text of 35 voicemail messages left for, or received 
by, Gordon Taylor. The attachment is entitled “TRANSCRIPT_FOR_NEVILLE.doc”.120

2.65 

In addition to this mountain of paper, the police also seized from Mr Mulcaire audio cassettes, 
CD roms, white boards showing pin numbers, security codes and bank details of potential 
victims.121 There was also a contract between Mr Mulcaire and the NoTW according to which 
Mr  Mulcaire  was  to  provide  “a  research  and  information  service”  to  the  newspaper  and 
undertook to carry out “all research and information assignments” requested.122

2.66  Further  material  related  to  payments  from  the  NoTW,  including  a  number  of  invoices 
showing  apparent  payments  to  Mr  Mulcaire.123  Suffice  to  say  that  he  was  paid  a  weekly 
retainer amounting to no less than £2,019 per week. In addition to the weekly retainer he 
also received other payments, typically of £250, which appear to have been linked to work 
on specific stories.

2.67  On the day of the arrests, the MPS notified the public that there were victims other than 
those  associated  with  the  Royal  Household.  Its  press  release  stated  that:  “As  a  result  of 
their enquiries police now believe that figures beyond the Royal Household have had their 
telephones intercepted …”124

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E2.68  Following  the  arrests,  NI  instructed  BCL  Burton  Copeland  Solicitors  (Burton  Copeland)  to 
respond on their behalf to any enquiries or requests from the police.125 How the firm went 
about discharging that responsibility is examined below but the evidence given by Colin Myler 
was that the role of Burton Copeland was to:126

“act  as  the  go-betweens  and  the  word  I’ve  used  before  is  a  bridge  head,  as  I 
understand, between the police and the company, so that anything that the police 
wanted Burton Copeland would facilitate, so that there was full transparency and 
there was no opportunity to accuse the company of being an obstruction to what the 
police were looking for.”

The interviews

2.69  On  8  and  9  August  2006  Mr  Mulcaire  and  Mr  Goodman  were  separately  interviewed  by 
junior rank detectives. Both were warned of their right to remain silent and, exercising that 
right, both declined to answer any questions giving ‘no comment’ responses.127 At this stage, 
however, what is of interest is not what they might have said but the questions themselves 
for  although,  at  that  stage,  the  police  would  only  have  been  able  to  undertake  a  cursory 
examination  of  the  documents  seized,  they  indicate  just  how  much  the  police  knew  or 
appreciated about the likely extent of Mr Mulcaire’s activities and, at least to some extent, 
who his victims were.

2.70  During the interviews of Mr Mulcaire on 9 August 2006, the interviewing officers referred to 
Abi Titmuss, and various sports people, offenders and members of the Royal Family (whose 
names have been redacted). Among the allegations put to Mr Mulcaire, Detective Constable 
Gallagher asked the following questions:

“I’m gonna cross reference something in this document. There’s a reference to Tessa 
Jowell and then in brackets, sorry circled above it says MP, gives a telephone number 
DDMI, PIN number. [Redacted] is crossed out David Mills and then it says [redacted], 
gives an account number and network Voda. David Mills is written underneath and 
it says husband and gives a telephone number for him and then (INAUDIBLE) refer to 
another document found in the kitchen cupboard of your home, exhibit WAB/61 is 
another sheet of A4 paper which also refers to Tessa Jowell and that has a telephone 
number there. If I can just show this to you, on the left hand side at the top of the 
page it says Tessa [redacted]. Now that sounds to me, that reads to me like you’ve 
written down somebody’s conversation. Is that what’s taken place here?
“Have you intercepted her voicemail?
“Either of Tessa Jowell or her husband?”

2.71  DC Gallagher also asked the following question, which made clear that the police had evidence 

to suggest that Lord Prescott had been the victim of voicemail interception:128

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE“Another  page  here,  this  has  got  the  name  John  Prescott.  There’s  another  name 
underneath, first of all it says advisor and then the name Joan Hammel. You’ve got her 
telephone numbers and DM1 numbers, password numbers and Vodafone passwords 
that I’ve already mentioned and an address in NW1. Have you got that information 
to access John Prescott’s network or that of his advisors?”

2.72  On the extent of the work that Mr Mulcaire was performing for the paper, DC Gallagher asked 

the following:

“Okay. We’ve got pages and pages of information here, at least another 30 odd pages, 
various names. Again you’ve got instances of telephone numbers, PIN numbers, etc. I 
just picked out ones which are relevant to this enquiry that we put to you so far. Okay, 
the last page in this document is an email message. This is very relevant ...
“This suggests that you do have a contract, a long term contract with the News of 
the World and that would account for you being paid up to £2,000 a week by them.
“Can you recall in the last interview, yeah, I put it to you that you were on a retainer 
by News of the World to do research for them. I hadn’t seen that email at the time and 
that supports what I said earlier on, remind you that you were being paid by them a 
fixed fee just to do regular for them at their behest. They’re asking you to do research 
for them and you’re providing them with information and on top of that, when you 
get a good one, then you have a separate contract for that particular job and you’re 
in the business of delving into people’s personal lives inappropriately, breaking the 
law to intercept telecommunications and that’s part and parcel of what you do. Have 
you got anything to say to that?”

2.73  DC Green returned to the issue on a later occasion and asked the following question:

“… I’m asking you to account for the fact that this invoice shows that you have been 
paid for what would appear to be work in and around a person called Jowell who I 
believe to be Tessa Jowell who we’ve outlined in other documents. I believe that this 
fact is because you may be taking part in the commission of the offence of unlawfully 
intercepting her telecommunications …”

2.74  Revealing a suspicion that Mr Mulcaire had been working for one or more NI journalists other 

than Mr Goodman, DC Green also put the following to him:

“… I have no doubt, this simply goes back and there is evidence there that you have 
been in the employee [sic] of News International for several years and you’ve been 
working with Mr Goodman most recently”.

2.75  On 9 August 2006, following the interviews, Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were charged 
with  conspiracy  to  intercept  communications  and  eight  substantive  offences  of  unlawful 
interception  of  communications.  Critical  context  for  this  development  in  the  investigation 
comes  from  other  arrests  which  took  place  on  the  same  day  as  part  of  an  investigation, 
Operation Overt. In short, 25 people were arrested for conspiracy to cause nine passenger 
aeroplanes  to  explode  over  the  Atlantic;  this  was  one  of  the  largest  counter  terrorism 
operations ever undertaken.129 When DCS Williams returned from leave on 12 August 2006, 
he received a briefing during, which he stated, he would have been told about the range of

291

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ematerial that had been found130 but it is highly material to bear in mind that, from that time, 
Operation Overt was also occupying his attention.131

 The initial review of the documents seized: compiling “The Blue 
Book”

2.76  The  police  have  access  to  a  computerised  system  to  record  the  largest  investigations  and 
for the analysis of the material received. It is known as HOLMES (Home Office Large Major 
Enquiry System) but it was not used for this operation. In evidence, DCS Williams and DCS 
Surtees  gave  different  reasons  for  this  decision.  DCS  Williams  said  that  HOLMES  was  not 
used because of the desire to keep the investigation secret. DCS Surtees said that it was not 
possible to record all the documents on the database because it was already at operational 
capacity.132

2.77 

In order to have the material analysed in more detail DCS Surtees had to negotiate for the 
necessary resources. Because his anti-terrorism colleagues were all working on Operation 
Overt,  DCS  Surtees  asked  for  some  20-30  officers  from  Special  Branch:133  “to  populate  a 
spread sheet with the details of all those individuals who appear on the documents seized 
that there is an indication of Interception offences against them”.134 They began work on 9 
August 2006.135

2.78 

In an entry in the decision log dated 10 August 2006, DCS Surtees gave a further indication 
of what the police were able to ascertain within days of seizing the documentation from Mr 
Mulcaire and which revealed his suspicions that Mr Mulcaire’s work was centred on obtaining 
access to voicemail messages:136

“Having reviewed the material seized at the address searches it is clear that there 
is  a  wealth  of  sensitive  documents  relating  to  hundreds  of  individuals  including 
Royal  Household,  Members  of  Parliament,  Sports  stars,  Military  Police,  Celebrities 
and journalists. There is also a number of electronic media seized including cassette 
tapes, microtapes and computers ...
“It  is  clear  from  the  documents  Recovered  from  the  searches  conducted  that 
Mulcaire has been engaged in sustained (years) period of research on behalf of News 
International, this assumption is based on the fact that News International have for a 
number of years paid substantial cash payments to his bank accounts. The documents 
are a collection of handwritten sheets that show ‘research’ work in various levels of 
completion. In many there is simply a name of a celebrity or well known public figure 
these develop into sheets detailing home addresses, business addresses, telephone 
numbers, DDNs, account numbers, passwords, pin numbers and scribblings of private 
information. Clearly from these documents I take the view that this research work

obtaining access to voicemail messages …”

2.79  With the identification and notification of potential victims in mind, DCS Surtees continued 

as follows in the decision log:137

“To establish a full picture as to whether individuals have been intercepted or the 
amount of times they have been intercepted all of the airtime providers will need 
to search their database to give us those details. Once all of this work is complete 
then I will discuss the issue of how we will notify those victims. Again whilst it would 
be advantageous to victims to be informed I would not be in a position to provide 
details and therefore would need to follow up each contact with further contact and 
conversations which by sheer volume would be impracticable. I am satisfied that the 
risk to these victims has diminished due to the arrest of the two subjects …
“From the documentary evidence referred to above a spread sheet has been produced 
showing the names of everyone who is featured regardless of how developed the 
research appears. So in some cases the spread sheet will simply feature the name with 
no other information apparent in others then many other boxes will be populated. 
Where we have a telephone number and a DDN I have asked for the telephone data 
to be cross referenced to ascertain whether possible interceptions have taken place. 
This will produce a possible ‘victim’ list …”

2.80  Before  passing  from  this  logged  decision,  it  is  important  to  note  that  DCS  Surtees  also 
recorded that the present advice from the CPS was that there needed to be evidence that the 
voicemail message was intercepted prior to being listened to by the intended recipient. Thus, 
the advice of David Perry QC (that the wider interpretation of s1 of RIPA which avoided having 
to  prove  that  ‘the  envelope  had  not  been  opened’  was  arguably  correct  and  that,  in  any 
event, the problems of interpretation could be wholly avoided by charging with conspiracy 
to commit the RIPA offence) had simply not filtered down to DCS Surtees. He continued to 
proceed on the basis of a far more restrictive interpretation of the law.

2.81  The spreadsheet required by DCS Surtees took officers from Special Branch five to seven days 
(including overtime over a weekend) to create.138 It became known as “the blue book”139 and 
DI Maberly explained that it was divided into two parts. The first part contained a list of “those 
potentially compromised” and the second summarised the content of the audio and video 
exhibits.140 The blue book also identified those who had potentially received the product of 
Mr Mulcaire’s work141 and was supplemented over the following weeks with various pieces of 
information, including information supplied by the telephone companies.142

2.82  DCS Surtees explained that where Mr Mulcaire had recorded the unique voicemail access 
number for a particular voicemail box, the relevant mobile phone company was asked whether 
the number had been dialled by numbers which could be attributed to Clive Goodman or 
Glenn Mulcaire, that is, “the suspect numbers”. The precise timing is not clear, but around 
the same time (and in line with the decision recorded on 10 August 2006), the police asked all 
five of the UK mobile phone service providers to identify calls by these suspect numbers, to

numbers was added a hub (or general) phone number at the NoTW which the police had also 
identified was being used to access voicemail boxes.144

2.83  On  17  August  2006  Burton  Copeland  wrote  to  Louis  Mably  (junior  counsel  for  the 
prosecution).145 In that letter they claimed that the NoTW had retained the services of Mr 
Mulcaire’s company, Nine Consultancy, for a number of years, but that the activities currently 
the  subject  of  charges  were  the  result  of  a  separate  arrangement  between  Mr  Goodman 
and Mr Mulcaire and were “undertaken and paid for outwith this official arrangement with 
the newspaper”. Burton Copeland claimed that at the end of October 2005 Mr Goodman 
introduced a supposed confidential source named “Alexander” who was given cash payments. 
They enclosed the records of payments made to “Alexander” and a corresponding schedule 
entitled “Cash paid by News International (through Goodman) to Glenn Mulcaire”. The cash 
payments totalled £12,300.

3.	 The	prosecution	strategy

3.1 

Conference with counsel on 21 August 2006
On 21 August 2006 a case conference took place at Counsels’ Chambers involving leading 
and  junior  counsel,  Ms  Carmen  Dowd  on  behalf  of  the  CPS,  and  various  police  officers, 
including DCS Williams. Mr Perry’s recollection is that, at that stage, he and Mr Mably did 
not have all the papers subsequently used at the Crown Court.146 The Inquiry has seen notes 
of this conference prepared by DCS Williams and also those of Mr Perry and Mr Mably.147 
In essence, the police officers explained to counsel that the review of the seized material 
had demonstrated the existence of approximately 180 targets of interception148 although the 
nature and quality of the evidence in relation to each had not been established. In order 
to ensure that the case remained manageable but also reflected the broad totality of the 
criminality, counsel advised that the matter should proceed to trial on the basis of four to 
six victims (in addition to those from the Royal Household) who should be selected as being 
representative of the group as a whole. The advice given by counsel was that this number 
of victims would afford the court adequate sentencing powers; it was important to provide 
a picture of the criminality so that its scope could be reflected.149 The inclusion of any more 
victims would not increase the sentencing powers of the court.150 This is a perfectly sensible 
and extremely common strategy. As DCS Surtees said descriptively, there is a point at which 
an indictment saturates.151

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE3.2 

Further, on the hypothesis that there were other potential defendants who were encouraging 
the commission of the primary offences, counsel pursued the question of whether anyone 
else was involved. In a short note produced on 14 July 2009, nearly three years later, Mr Perry 
and Mr Mably recorded the following:152

“We  did  enquire  of  the  police  at  the  conference  whether  there  was  any  evidence 
that  the  editor  of  the  News  of  the  World  was  involved  in  the  Goodman-Mulcaire 
offences. We were told that there was not (and we never saw such evidence). We 
also enquired whether there was any evidence connecting Mulcaire to other News of 
the World journalists. Again we were told that there was not (and we never saw any 
such evidence).”

3.3 

Notwithstanding the apparent certainty of counsels’ recollection as expressed in their note, 
the evidence given by Mr Perry was slightly less emphatic as regards the specificity of his 
questions:153

“I don’t think I would like to say that I necessarily expressed it in precisely those terms, 
but I was concerned to discover whether this went further than just the particular 
individuals with which we were concerned and I think I was conscious in my own mind 
that the question had to be whether it was journalists to the extent of the editor.”

3.4  Mr Perry clarified during his evidence that his question was directed at ascertaining whether 
there  was  evidence  that  would  support  charges  against  other  individuals  rather  than 
understanding simply what suspicions the police might have had. Having been asked whether 
it was possible that there were speculative discussions along the lines that there might be 
circumstantial or inferential evidence, as opposed to anything concrete, he said:154

“It’s certainly possible, although I have no recollection of it, and I think from my point 
of view I would have been looking to see whether there was a possibility of a case, 
rather than whether there was something that was speculative …”

3.5 

Recognising  that  many  cases  are  built  on  circumstantial  or  inferential  evidence,  Mr  Perry 
said:155

“But it depends on the combination of circumstances and the strength of any evidence, 
but certainly in the context of looking at the material that we had in this case and 
the evidence available to us, I certainly don’t think I saw anything that would have 
enabled me to present a case in any – on the basis of any inference or circumstantial 
evidence.”

3.6  Mr Perry also made it clear that he had not seen any evidence that other individuals had 
been involved, but that he was basing his question on his own knowledge and experience of 
journalists and newspapers.156 In answer to his direct question, Mr Perry said:157

“We were informed that there was no such evidence. I can’t recall which officer gave 
that reply. I think, in fairness to everyone involved in the case, I think it’s right to 
say that this was still at a time when the information that we were obtaining was 
continuing to develop.”

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E3.7 

DCS Williams does not dispute that counsel would have been told at the conference that 
there was no evidence that others at NoTW were involved in the conspiracy. When he gave 
evidence, DCS Williams said that:158

“… we were all aware of what the speculations, potentially how this might be further 
than these two men, because that was part of our discussion in terms of considering 
whether  or  not  there  may  be  other  defendants.  In  terms  of  there  actually  being 
evidence, and they had access to all the material, then I would agree: at that time, 
we didn’t have evidence.”

3.8 

It  seems  overwhelmingly  likely  both  that  DCS  Williams  was  the  officer  who  answered  Mr 
Perry’s question (neither DCS Surtees nor DI Maberly were at the conference) and that Mr 
Perry’s  recollection  of  the  answer  given  was  accurate.  As  to  his  note  concerning  “anyone 
else’s  involvement”,  DCS  Williams  said  that  there  was  discussion  and  speculation  about 
whether others were involved; it was this discussion that led onto the question of obtaining a 
production order pursuant to PACE directed to NI, requiring the production of documents.159

3.9  When DCS Williams was asked about the reference to a production order and his note: “if 
identifies other defendant – consider”, he said that the intention was that if the fruits of a 
production order revealed further suspects, they would consider the position at that time.160 
DCS Williams described his thinking as follows:161

“[Mr Mulcaire] has a contract for something like 104,000 a year. What’s he getting – 
why’s he got that? Who’s tasking him? What are they tasking him with? And equally, 
what’s he giving back? Dependent on the outcome of that, we would be able to do 
analysis in terms of, well, assessing, then, consider, actually, what is it that we might 
be able to do in terms of building a further case?”

3.10  Also after three years, on 15 July 2009, DCS Williams provided a note to the CPS which contained 
his  recollection  of  the  conference.162  In  it,  he  set  out  his  belief  that  everyone  recognised 
that  proving  that  someone  was  the  victim  of  interception  was  “extremely  challenging”  (a 
statement which, as Keir Starmer QC163 himself recognised, was consistent with the narrow 
view of the law).164 DCS Williams further explained:165

“In  relation  to  whether  or  not  anyone  else  was  involved.  As  a  part  of  this  same 
conference and considering what we had discovered we actually commented that we 
were open to the potential for there to be other defendants and in fact part of our 
discussion was around the merits of getting a Production Order to see if it would reveal 
more  to  help  our  understanding.  Our  NTFIU,  MPS  Legal  services  and  Louis  Mably 
were actioned to explore that further, particularly around what we could legitimately 
ask  for  in  such  an  order,  but  the  view  of  the  meeting  was  that,  that  process  may 
well be ‘drawn out’ by NOTW and that if possible we would seek disclosure through

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEwritten request to their legal department seeking cooperation with our investigation. 
The latter is what happened …”

3.11  Mr Starmer declined to comment on this segment of DCS Williams’ note.166 Subsequently, 
Mr  Mably  stated  that  he  “broadly  agreed”  with  it.167  Mr  Perry  explained  that  there  were 
two issues relating to the question of a production order: the first was whether there was 
any basis for obtaining evidence generally by way of a production order, and the second was 
whether a production order should be sought to obtain evidence of payments made by Mr 
Goodman to Mr Mulcaire.168 Mr Perry emphasised that he did not think that the minds of 
anyone were closed at that stage169 and it is certainly accurate that, following the conference, 
Mr Mably did, in fact, draft an application for a production order.170

3.12 

I do not believe that DCS Williams sought to downplay the number of victims, as has been 
suggested, still less that he misled counsel in any respect. It is right that DCS Williams told 
counsel that there was “no evidence” that journalists other than Mr Goodman were involved, 
when  in  reality  there  was  inferential  and  circumstantial  evidence,171  but  this  was  in  the 
context of the common understanding that counsel was enquiring into whether there was 
sufficient evidence to charge any further suspects. DCS Williams did not hide from counsel 
his suspicions that others were involved, on the contrary, they were openly discussed: he 
sought advice from counsel on whether a production order could be obtained in order to 
secure evidence to substantiate those suspicions. DCS Williams was plainly open to pursuing 
investigative avenues with a view to supporting the hypothesis that others were involved. It 
would be unfair to suggest that, in some way, he was setting out to restrict the investigation 
and avoid casting the net beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.

3.13  Furthermore, no evidence was concealed. At the very least, counsel and the CPS knew of the 
evidence supporting the charges that became counts 16-20 and were aware of the corner 
names which could implicate other journalists (because of counts 16 to 20). Counsel were 
given a copy of the blue book; further, albeit for the specific and limited purpose of reviewing 
the unused material,172 Mr Mably was given access to all the documents seized, including all 
the Mulcaire papers.

3.14 

It is also clear from the notes of the conference that counsel gave some consideration to the 
technical legal question which arose under RIPA namely whether it was necessary to prove 
that  the  unlawful  interceptions  had  taken  place  before  the  voicemail  messages  had  been 
listened to by their intended recipients. It is less clear, however, precisely what advice was

170 Draft application not published
171 This is addressed below
172 This issue of the review of unused material is raised at different times and it is important to understand precisely 
what is involved in the exercise and what can be derived from it. The purpose of any review of unused material 
(conducted in this case by junior counsel, Mr Mably) is not to look for evidence that might implicate others (in this 
case, others at NI or elsewhere), but to fulfil the disclosure obligations imposed on the prosecution by the Criminal 
Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA). S3 (Initial duty of prosecutor to disclose) provides that: “The prosecutor 
must – (a) disclose to the accused any prosecution material which has not previously been disclosed to the accused 
and which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the case for the prosecution against the accused 
or of assisting the case for the accused, or (b) give to the accused a written statement that there is no material of a 
description mentioned in paragraph (a)

297

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Egiven, and with what emphasis. That said, Mr Perry gave clear evidence to the effect that he 
did not advise that the narrow view of the law was correct. In short: 173

“well, I’m confident that that was not the approach that we took because it wouldn’t 
be consistent with the terms of the indictment that was originally settled, and I think 
that the view that Mr Mably and I took was that what Lord Woolf had said in the 
Ipswich  Crown  Court  case174  certainly  provided  an  arguable  basis  for  someone  to 
contend that the narrow view was correct, but we thought that we should proceed on 
the broader view, and if the point were taken against us, we could meet it in a number 
of ways, because it was about making sure that we didn’t lose the case overall, and 
we could meet it in a number of ways … [a]nd in any event, the conspiracy charge 
could outflank any such argument”.

3.15  So  it  came  about  that,  in  due  course,  counts  16  to  20  of  the  indictment,  which  alleged 
substantive offences under RIPA solely against Mr Mulcaire, were drafted by counsel. As Mr 
Perry explained in evidence, he could not possibly have taken the narrow interpretation of 
the law to be correct since, in relation to counts 16 to 20 there was neither evidence nor basis 
for saying that the message had been listened to by an interceptor before it had been heard 
by the intended recipient.175 Further, Mr Perry did not advise the police to obtain “Vampire” 
data in relation to counts 16 to 20. Put simply, Mr Perry is correct. It is simply inconceivable 
that he (or any counsel instructed by the Crown to prosecute allegations of crime) would 
have prepared an indictment on the premise of a legal interpretation which they knew to be 
incorrect. I have no doubt that Mr Perry gave the advice in the terms summarised by him in 
his evidence.

3.16  Whether DCS Williams took away this message from this conference is less clear. In his witness 
statement for the purposes of the judicial review, DCS Williams said that counsel advised 
that counts 16 to 20 should be included in order to test the law.176 It is apparent, however, 
as will be seen from the various notes, briefings and memoranda that he produced in 2009 
that, at that stage at least, he was under the impression that counsel had been advising that 
the narrow interpretation of the law was correct. It is a safe assumption that DCS Williams 
misunderstood, or misremembered, what counsel had advised in August 2006; it would not 
be safe or correct to conclude that DCS Williams deliberately mis-stated counsels’ advice on 
these subsequent occasions.

3.17  Regardless of the extent to which both Mr Perry advised clearly and the advice was properly 
understood,  following  this  conference,  the  police  made  no  attempt  to  obtain  technical 
evidence in relation to what became counts 16 to 20 which would have enabled the case 
to be proved on the narrow view of the law. Nor is there any contemporaneous evidence 
to  show  that  counsels’  advice  caused  surprise  or  consternation  in  the  police  camp.  From 
that point therefore, the advice previously given by the CPS had no bearing upon the way

Morning-Hearing-4-April-2012.pdf. This evidence contradicts what Mr Perry recorded in his advice dated 20 July 2009 
which said in terms that it was necessary to prove that the message was intercepted before it was accessed by the 
intended recipient. To the suggestion that this might have been the advice he gave in 2006 Mr Perry said that: “if I did 
in this document give the impression that the narrow view had been adopted then that is incorrect” – p38, lines 17-19,

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEthe  prosecution  was  prepared  and  advanced.177  It  is  also  worth  adding  that,  at  the  same 
conference, counsel  advised  that  the  appropriate charges should  be  under  RIPA; offences 
under the CMA (which had no technical problems) were not pursued so as to ensure a simpler 
presentation to a jury.178

3.18  The last topic discussed was the question of confiscation pursuant to s6 of the Proceeds of Crime 
Act 2002. Without setting out the detail of the relevant statutory provisions, a confiscation 
order, in essence, requires a convicted defendant to pay a sum of money representing the 
level of his or her financial benefit from his or her criminal conduct. The police wished to 
contend for a substantial benefit figure based on the monthly retainer on the basis that it was 
part and parcel of Mr Mulcaire’s criminal enterprise.179 However, given NI’s claim, through 
Burton Copeland, that the monthly retainer paid to Mr Mulcaire did not relate to the matters 
that  were  the  subject  of  charges,180  Mr  Perry  advised  that  the  confiscation  proceedings 
should focus on the cash payments, which amounted to £12,300.181 Mr Perry explained that 
the short point was that if Mr Mulcaire was doing legitimate work it was difficult to argue 
that it was as a result of or in connection with the offending. Mr Perry agreed that it was his 
decision that this was the appropriate approach to take.182 It is convenient to state here that 
ultimately the Crown Court made a confiscation order for £12,300.

3.19  Before passing from the information placed before Mr Perry and the advice that he gave, it 
is appropriate to refer to the “for Neville” email. When giving evidence, Mr Perry was asked 
whether or not he saw this email at this conference or at any stage before 26 January 2007 
(when Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were sentenced). Mr Perry said in evidence that he did 
not have any recollection of seeing it,183 and he did not shift his ground when shown a note 
of a much later conference on 1 October 2010 which suggested that he saw this email after 
the case papers relating to Mr Gordon Taylor had been prepared for trial.184 It is right that 
the email formed part of the unused material but Mr Perry was not asked to examine that 
material and would not have been expected to do so absent specific instruction. Although 
it may not advance the issue very far, I conclude that Mr Perry probably did not see the “for 
Neville” email earlier than his recollection.

Victims not associated with the Royal Household

3.20  Following the conference, the investigating officers set about contacting victims to ascertain 
whether  they  would  be  willing  to  provide  evidence  in  support  of  the  prosecution.185  DCS 
Surtees gave evidence that one of these victims was Tessa Jowell and, furthermore, that she 

177 It equally had no bearing on the later decision not to broaden the investigation, which was taken for other reasons.

“I remember very clearly the conversation, which, as I say, took place on holiday. I 
happened to be by the swimming pool with very close friends that I was on holiday 
with. The conversation didn’t take very long, but I am absolutely clear that I sought 
clarification about what further I should do, expressed my willingness to help in any 
way that I could but was assured that at that stage there was nothing further that I 
needed to do.
“… I would also say that I was a secretary of state and a privy councillor. It would 
have been absolutely incumbent on me, were I asked to co-operate with an inquiry, 
to  agree  to.  My  principal  private  secretary,  who  is  a  civil  servant,  confirmed  my 
willingness to help, as too the two friends that I was on – who I recounted this too, 
are also abundantly clear about the account of the conversation that I gave them.
“… I was telephoned again by the police to be told that a prosecution was going to be 
brought against Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. I asked if I needed to provide a 
statement or further assistance. I can’t remember the precise word that I used, but it 
was essentially an offer of any assistance with the inquiry, and was told very clearly 
that I wouldn’t be needed as a witness because they had witnesses from the royal 
household who would support the prosecution.”

3.21  This is not an issue that is directly relevant to my Terms of Reference but I find the evidence 
given by Ms Jowell on this point to be compelling. It is not necessary to decide how DCS 
Surtees came to recall otherwise save that I do not conclude that he was deliberately seeking 
to minimise the impact on NI: had he wished to do that, he would not have spoken to her in 
the first place.

3.22 

In the meantime, in response to the request to identify any customers whose voicemail boxes 
had been called by the suspect numbers, Vodafone emailed DI Maberly, on 29 August 2006, 
with a spreadsheet of calls made to 61 unique voicemail access numbers by Mr Goodman’s 
home landline and Mr Mulcaire’s office landline. A large number of those on the list were 
celebrities and well-known public figures, whilst others appeared to be company names.188 On 
30 August 2006 DI Maberly emailed Orange to ask if there was “an indication of interception” 
of the voicemail messages of six named individuals, including Simon Hughes. He also sent an 
email to Vodafone asking if anyone had listened to the voicemail of nine named people.189 
On 10 October 2006, O2 responded to the request to identify customers whose voicemail 
boxes had been called by the suspect numbers by sending DI Maberly a spreadsheet setting 
out the number of times that the 93 customers concerned had been called by the suspect 
numbers.190

3.23 

In  the  light  of  the  information  that  became  available,  an  appropriate  number  of  victims 
(additional  to  those  emanating  from  the  Royal  Household)  were  identified  as  the  named 
victims for the charges that were represented by counts 16 to 20 of the indictment directed 
at  Glenn  Mulcaire  (and  not  part  of  the  conspiracy  count  which  involved  Clive  Goodman). 
They were chosen, essentially, because of the high volume of frequency of calls (along with

their duration) to the unique voicemail access numbers by Mr Mulcaire.191 The subjects of 
these five charges were Max Clifford, Skylet Andrew, Graham Taylor, Simon Hughes and Elle 
Macpherson.

In  the  light  of  all  the  circumstances,  it  is  necessary  to  deal  with  one  further  discussion 
with a potential victim of multiple interceptions. DCS Williams gave evidence that, in early 
September  2006,  the  police  contacted  Rebekah  Brooks  (then  editor  of  The  Sun)  to  notify 
her that she was a potential victim of voicemail interception and to ascertain whether she 
wanted to make a formal complaint in that capacity.192 An email, dated 15 September 2006, 
sent by Andy Coulson to Tom Crone after this meeting, which set out what Mrs Brooks had 
been told “by the cops”, has generated a number of concerns.193 On the face of the email, it 
appeared that the police had given Mrs Brooks details of the prosecution strategy over and 
above that which any other victim of crime could expect to be given and it is suggested that, 
in so doing, the police were improperly alerting her to the state of the investigation by the 
MPS, inviting her to take action internally. Further, the last sentence of the email (“They are 
going to contact RW today to see if she wishes to take it further”) could be interpreted as 
meaning that the police were asking her whether she wanted the police to take further the 
investigation into others within NI.194

3.25  Again, I can well understand how this second hand summary of the conversation, reduced 
into an email, can give the impression of collusion but, having heard DCS Williams’ evidence 
on this issue, I am satisfied that Mrs Brooks was contacted by the police because she, too, had 
been a victim of extensive voicemail interception (with her voicemails having been accessed 
up to twice a week). I also accept that information was passed to Mrs Brooks not as a result 
of an improper relationship with the police but with a view to her making a formal complaint 
and consenting to being part of the prosecution.195 This is the context in which one must view 
the final line of the email. As DCS Williams said: “This is purely: you are a potential victim. 
Would you like to join our prosecution?”196

3.26  The same email also referred to Mr Mulcaire receiving payments totalling over £1 million. 
In  evidence,  DCS  Williams  said  that  the  figure  of  £1  million  was  not  known  to  him  or  his 
investigation  team.197  Since  the  £1  million  figure  is  not  supported  by  evidence  available 
contemporaneously or subsequently it is simply not clear where this figure came from. Again, 
the present investigation and prosecution precludes any further investigation of this issue.

3.27  Fitting within the general chronology, it is relevant to note two engagements between NI 
and senior officers of the MPS. The first was on 19 September 2006 when Lord Blair, with Mr 
Fedorcio, met Andy Coulson. Whilst there could well be a concern that this meeting provided 
the opportunity for the exercise of inappropriate influence over the police investigation (and 
perhaps  rather  more  thought  should  have  been  given  to  the  perception  that  could  result 
from the meeting), there is not the slightest evidence that this was a reality. As I have set 
out above, Lord Blair played no part in the decision-making process; his involvement did not 
go beyond receiving limited briefings from Mr Hayman and Mr Clarke. The second was on

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E26 October 2006 and consisted of a two hour, early evening, meeting between Mr Hayman 
and Neil Wallis. The problem of perception (and the question of the extent to which that 
perception was considered) recurs. Again, there is no evidential basis for concluding that this 
meeting impacted in any way on the police investigation.

3.28 

The approach of Burton Copeland
In  order  to  obtain  relevant  evidence  from  NI,  the  CPS  advised  the  police  to  enter  into 
correspondence  with  them  (though  Burton  Copeland).  This  was  because  the  legislative 
provisions for obtaining a production order, which would require NI to produce journalistic 
material to the police or provide the police with access to it required other methods to have 
been tried without success or that it be established that such methods were bound to fail.198 
Thus, a court would be unlikely to make a production order, requiring a person or organisation 
to hand over such journalistic material, if it were satisfied that the person or organisation in 
possession of the material appeared to be cooperating with the police.

3.29 

In the light of the fact that NI had instructed Burton Copeland to respond to police requests, 
the officers sought their cooperation and assistance, through Burton Copeland, in relation to 
a number of evidential matters.

3.30  The investigators were keen to identify who would have used the hub phone at the NoTW 
that had been used hundreds of times to call the voicemail boxes of individuals not associated 
with the Royal Household.199 DI Maberly approached Vodafone who told him that he would 
have to get that information from the NoTW.200 Mr Bristowe (the prosecution’s telephone 
expert) advised DI Maberly that no large firm would have unaccounted for billing, because 
it would want to monitor the use of the phone systems by staff, to detect any abuses. The 
police therefore had an expectation that NI would be able to identify the user of the hub 
phone in question.201

3.31  DCS Surtees tasked DI Maberly with writing to the NoTW for the purposes of ascertaining 
who would have used the hub phone and obtaining further evidence against Mr Mulcaire and 
Mr Goodman, but also to gather evidence of the involvement of other journalists or editorial 
staff in the conspiracy with Mr Mulcaire.202

3.32  On 31 August 2006 DI Maberly attended Burton Copeland’s offices and made a number of 
requests  for  information.203  That  same  day  Burton  Copeland  wrote  a  letter  to  the  police, 
apparently  stating  an  intention  to  cooperate  fully  with  all  their  reasonable  requests  for 
information:204

“On behalf of my clients, Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd, I would wish to make it plain 
that in connection with the enquiries that you are presently conducting and which 
are referred to in the Application under the Schedule 1 of the Police and Criminal

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEEvidence Act (PACE Application) … that my clients intend to provide such material as 
you or your colleagues might reasonably require from them in connection with your 
enquiries.”

3.33 

In  that  letter  Burton  Copeland  referred  to  the  “PACE  application”  (the  application  for  a 
production order drafted by Mr Mably) and the fact that the police sought:

“all paid cheques, credit/debit slips, mandates, statements of accounts, inter-account 
and telegraphic transfers, any other vouchers in relation to the following financial 
accounts. Account numbers … sort code … or payment to any other bank accounts 
held in the name of Glenn Mulcaire, Nine Consultancy Ltd or Nine Consultancy UK Ltd 
and any cash payments made by or on behalf of News International or Newsgroup 
Newspaper to Glenn Mulcaire from 1 January 2005 present [sic]”.205

Burton  Copeland  enclosed  a  file  labelled  “Newsgroup  International  –  Payments  to  Nine 
Consultancy Ltd” which they asserted contained the requested information and included in 
particular:206

“1. A schedule that has been created from the records maintained of all payments to 
the accounts referred to in the PACE Application;
2.  The  appropriate  BACS  Telecom  Acceptance  Advice  relating  to  payments  to  be 
included in the payment schedule;
3. The redacted payment schedule which highlights each payment to Nine Consultancy 
Ltd;
The appropriate copy invoice in respect of each payment included in the schedule 
referred to in 1 above.”

3.34  DI Maberly also followed up the meeting with a letter, which he delivered to Burton Copeland’s 
offices on 7 September 2006.207 In that letter he confirmed what he had requested.208 Those 
requests included:209

(a)  A  floor  plan  to  include  the  locations  of  the  telephone  extensions  in  Mr  Goodman’s 

office;

(b)  Details of the phones used regularly by Mr Goodman (i.e. the number of the phone on 

(c) 

his desk or any mobile issued to him by the company);
Itemised billing for phones used regularly by Goodman (i.e. the phone on his desk and 
any other mobile phone issued to him) for the period of 1st December 2005 to 8th 
August 2006;

(d)  Records of any work completed by Mr Mulcaire/Nine Consultancy for Mr Goodman or 

other editors/journalists.

(e)  Records of any work completed

any  fellow  conspirators.  Therefore  we  require  the  telephone  numbers  of  persons 
called before and after relevant unlawful calls to the voice mailboxes.”

3.36  On 15 September 2006 DI Maberly hand delivered a further letter to Burton Copeland which 

included the following:210

“During the search of Mr Goodman’s offices at News International he identified the 
computer used by him (situated on his desk) and a safe also used by him (situated 
under  his  desk).  These  items  were  not  seized  or  searched  but  were  subject  to  a 
retention request. In relation to these two items I would like to be provided with a 
copy of information held on computer (including any mainframe database accessed 
from the desktop computer) and any information held in the safe that relates to the 
following;
 

Material relating to any mobile telephone numbers that may [sic] connected to 
the  interception  of  voicemail  accounts  (e.g.  written  notes,  data  files,  cassette/
digital recordings etc) …
Material relating to any voicemail(s) that may have been listened to (e.g. written 
notes, data files, cassette/digital recordings etc) …
Evidence  of  contact  between  Mr  Clive  Goodman,  Mr  Glenn  Mulcaire,  Mr  Paul 
Williams,  Nine  Consultancy  …  and  any  others  (whether  directly  or  indirectly 
employed by News International) relating to the interception of voicemail(s)”.

 

 

3.37  Burton  Copeland  had  drafted  a  letter  dated  14  September  2006,  which  they  gave  to  DI 

Maberly when he visited their premises on 15 September 2006. It stated the following:211

“Newsgroup  Newspapers  are  anxious  to  provide  all  material  reasonably  required 
in  respect  of  your  investigation  into  voicemail  interception  offences.  We  stress, 
however, that the procedure under Part 2 of the 1984 Act is a procedure designed 
to produce documentation or other material in the possession of an individual. It is 
not a procedure designed to elicit answers other than those contained within such 
material.
“In fact, very little documentary or other material in relation to Mr Mulcaire, Nine 
Consultancy Ltd or Mr Goodman exists. This is entirely consistent with normal business 
practices in relation to the use of such consultants.
“Attached to this letter are copies of all documents held by Newsgroup Newspapers 
falling within the terms of your request. This comprises copy documentation relating 
to the contract of employment between Nine Consultancy Ltd and NOTW. Extensive 
searches have revealed the existence of only one piece of paper, enclosed herewith.
“No documents exist recording any work completed by Mr Mulcaire, monitoring of Mr 
Mulcaire’s return of work, reporting structures or any persons for whom Mr Mulcaire 
may have provided information. There is no floor plan. The telephone system installed 
at Newsgroup Newspapers does not provide an itemised breakdown in respect of any 
particular extension number…
“Newsgroup  Newspapers  wishes  fully  to  assist  your  investigation  and  does  not 
require any formal Court Order for the provision of any material. They are, however, 
entirely satisfied that the material to which you are entitled is limited and that you

304

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE3.38 

are  now,  along  with  material  previously  submitted,  in  possession  of  all  relevant 
documentation…”

It is interesting to note that Burton Copeland were precise in seeking to confine the entitlement 
of the police to documents “in the possession of an individual” as opposed to documents held 
by NI generally. In my judgment this is an artificial and inapt distinction: by way of example, 
there must have been an internal telephone directory for the NoTW and documentation that 
could have led the police (perhaps through the telephone network if the records were not 
kept) to trace which extensions were dialling which numbers. DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and 
DI Maberly all formed the impression that whilst Burton Copeland were protesting that they 
were cooperating, the reality was the opposite.212 In evidence DI Maberly agreed that he was 
very suspicious that he was being “fobbed off”.213

3.39  After  15  September  2006,  no  further  documents  were  produced  by  Burton  Copeland.  
Ultimately  therefore,  NI  provided  the  MPS  with  extremely  scant  information.  The  MPS 
describes  this,  correctly  in  my  judgment,  as  a  “veneer  of  cooperation”.  Despite  their 
protestations to the contrary, NI were not helping the police with their enquiries.

3.40 

It is relevant that once NI decided, in January 2011, fully to co-operate with the MPS, that 
is  exactly  what  happened  and  the  investigations  that  have  become  Operations  Weeting, 
Elveden and Tuleta (with subsidiary operations associated with them) has been the result. 
While signalling the intention of NI now to place itself in the position of demonstrating that it 
takes compliance with the criminal law extremely seriously, it undeniably casts light on what 
had happened previously. I am not in a position to judge what part, if any, Burton Copeland 
played in the approach to the police investigation in 2006, what their instructions were or the 
advice they gave because NI has not waived the legal professional privilege which attaches 
to this material. As a result, the public can only know what Burton Copeland did and not why 
they did it.

3.41  Rupert Murdoch’s evidence was that when Mr Goodman was arrested he was told, probably 
by Les Hinton, then the Executive Chairman of NI, that NI was co-operating with the police.214 
In support of the contention that NI was cooperating, Rupert Murdoch referred to appointing 
“a special law firm to look into this and to aid our co-operation with the police…”215 When he 
was told, during his evidence, that the Inquiry had heard evidence that the solicitors’ firm 
concerned provided limited documentation216 that did not represent the position at all and 
that, one way or another, NI was being obstructive Rupert Murdoch said: “That shocks me 
deeply, and I was unaware of it and I’ve not heard of it until you’ve just said that.217

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E3.42  This  raises  two  issues  about  local  management  at  NI,  its  internal  governance  and  its 
relationship with News Corporation. First, if Rupert Murdoch’s evidence is correct, it appears 
that there was a lack of full transparency between the local management at NI and senior 
management  at  News  Corporation  or,  alternatively,  a  very  different  understanding  of  the 
meaning of the word co-operation. Second the approach taken by NI is far from what might 
be expected of a well-run corporation. Mr Clarke described a closing of ranks by NI and said 
that this was “unusual for a major company – where full co-operation would be the norm”.218 
An organisational culture that is founded on integrity and honesty would require not only 
full co-operation with law enforcement, but also a determination to expose behaviour that 
failed to comply with the law. That would normally be achieved through a thorough internal 
investigation of any allegation, unaffected by the legal constraints that the police might face, 
in order to ensure that any wrongdoing in the company was uncovered, stopped and dealt 
with appropriately. What happened at the NoTW in relation to voicemail interception in this 
context is particularly informative about the culture that pertained both within the corporate 
and editorial operations.

The report of the High Tech Crime Unit

3.43  On  23  November  2006,  pursuant  to  a  task  set  by  DCS  Surtees,  the  High  Tech  Crime  Unit 
of  the  Directorate  of  Professional  Standards  at  the  MPS  produced  a  report219  setting  out 
the results of the examination of the computers and other storage media seized during the 
August searches.220 The examination revealed a computerised record of approximately 300 
names, addresses, dates of birth, mobile phone numbers and additional information. Many 
of the names have been redacted to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned, but 
the  unredacted  names  include:  Maria,  Charlotte  and  James  Church;  Max  Clifford;  Ashley 
Cole; Stephen J. Coogan; Cornelia Crisan; George Galloway; Ryan Giggs; James Hewitt; Ulrika 
Jonsson; Jude Law; Sadie Frost; Elle McPherson; Mark Oaten and Brian Paddick.

3.44  The investigating officers were concerned to discover that within the report were the details 
of people who had been given new identities as part of the witness protection programme.221 
The extreme sensitivity of this information does not require elaboration. Equally seriously, at 
the least, it gave rise to the possibility that police officers had been providing information to 
Mr Mulcaire. Mr Mulcaire was not asked about this in interview and Mr Clarke was not made 
aware of it.

3.45  DCS Surtees instructed DI Maberly to contact the witness protection unit, provide them with 
the list of names and ask them to take whatever action they considered necessary.222 When DI 
Maberly did so: “it quickly became apparent that contained within were names of interest to 
[the unit].”223 The SO13 officers did not know what action was taken by the witness protection 
unit; they left the matter with that unit because it was best placed to decide upon and take

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEthe appropriate remedial action.224 Mr Clarke agreed that this was the correct way of dealing 
with the matter.225

3.46  The report of the High Tech Crime Unit included the following statement: “It is also believed 
attempts  may  have  been  made  to  corrupt  serving  police  officers  and  misuse  the  Police 
National Computer”. It is argued by the Core Participant Victims that the apparent failure to 
act on this adds to the impression that there were areas of investigation which were highly 
sensitive and  which  made the MPS unwilling  to probe further. Although  I understand  the 
concern, it would not be appropriate for me to go further. Suffice to say, the current criminal 
investigation continues and my determination not to prejudice that investigation has meant 
that further detail has not been explored in the evidence. The points that I have made about 
the individual officers responsible for the conduct of Operation Caryatid are not affected and 
remain, even if there was some additional thread which could have been followed.

4.2  Mr Perry explained that counts 2 to 15 were substantive allegations intended as an alternative 
to count 1 which charged the underlying criminal conspiracy; in relation to all the substantive 
counts, there was not necessarily the evidence available to prove that the voicemails had been 
listened to before their intended recipients.226 Counts 16 to 20 were individual substantive 
charges intended to reflect the further criminality.

On 29 November 2006, at the Plea and Case Management hearing conducted at the Central 
Criminal  Court,  Mr  Goodman  and  Mr  Mulcaire  pleaded  guilty  to  the  main  counts  on  the 
indictment. Although it might be legitimate to conclude that the lawyers acting for the men had

no confidence in the possible success of any argument relating to the correct interpretation 
of s1 of RIPA, the fact is that it was simply never tested. On 26 January 2007, Mr Justice Gross 
sentenced Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire to four and six months’ imprisonment respectively.

At the sentencing hearing, during the course of his plea in mitigation, counsel for Mr Mulcaire 
asserted that his client was working for others at NI in relation to the interceptions which 
formed the basis of counts 16 to 20. He said, in terms: “This information would have been 
passed on not to Mr Goodman – I stress the point – but to the same organisation”.227

Although  this  has  been  a  matter  of  some  debate,  the  point  has  already  been  made  that 
Mr Goodman had no specific interest (perhaps with some limited exceptions) in the non-
Royal material, and it is clear that the evidential links between the two men which had been 
present for the Royal interceptions were not available for the others. Yet, Mr Mulcaire must 
have been working for someone. Mr Justice Gross picked up on this submission in his own 
sentencing remarks. He said: “As to Counts 16-20, you had not dealt with Goodman but with 
others at News International”.228

Although Mr Perry rightly pointed out that the judge did not reach this conclusion as a result 
of any submission he had made during the course of opening the case that morning, he readily 
accepted that the judge was not simply relying on the submissions of Mr Mulcaire’s counsel 
but also on “a bit of common sense added in”.229 It is right to observe that Mr Perry added in 
his witness statement that: “… reading the transcript now does not convey the implication that 
other individuals were necessarily involved in unlawful interception (as opposed to receiving 
information).” 230 This may be right, but again common sense would strongly indicate that 
the other individuals were aware of the source of the information they had received from 
Mr Mulcaire and it is difficult to postulate that Mr Mulcaire was simply offering information 
without being encouraged or prompted.

4.7  Mr Justice Gross also referred in his sentencing remarks to the fact that Mr Goodman had 
offered by way of mitigation that he “operated in an environment in which ethical lines are 
not  clearly  defined  or  observed”.231  From  the  perspective  of  the  management  at  NI,  the 
sentencing remarks ought to have raised serious alarm bells that there may have been other 
journalists in the newsroom engaging in illegal or unethical activity; what otherwise should 
have been needed to launch  a full  scale review into every aspect of the work that Glenn 
Mulcaire had done for the NoTW?

5.	 Subsequent	operational	decisions
5.1 

One  of  the  most  serious  allegations  against  the  police  relates  to  the  deliberate  decision 
effectively to shut down Operation Caryatid when it is argued that there was clearly much 
more that could have been uncovered. It is suggested that the decision not to pursue further 
investigations could have been affected by the relationship between the officers of the MPS 
and NI or, in other words, had not been taken in good faith or for good operational reasons. 
Similar concerns (examined in the next section) deal with the strategy adopted to deal with 
the aftermath of the investigation, particularly in relation to victims or potential victims.

5.3 

In  the  circumstances,  it  has  been  necessary  to  investigate  in  detail  the  circumstances  in 
which the police reached the decision not to take Operation Caryatid further. This involves 
an understanding of the police operational background at the time of the investigation, and 
an analysis of the evidential issues concerning the police along the possible next steps that 
could have been taken.

The background
Police resources are finite and the decision not to widen the Operation Caryatid investigation 
cannot properly be understood without a full understanding of the operational context at the 
time. More specifically, for what had been SO13, whose primary commitment was to counter 
terrorism, the issue was the scale and immediacy of the threat from terrorism at the time and 
the massive pressure on resources that it entailed. It is of such importance that it is worth 
quoting extensively from the statement made by Mr Clarke:232

“72…  Throughout  much  of  2002  and  running  into  2003  an  operation  called 
Springbourne taught us that there was a real and immediate threat within the UK 
from Islamist terrorists …
“73. During 2003-2004 there was an accelerating tempo of terrorist investigations … 
There were many other strands of intelligence that showed the threat to the UK from 
Islamist terrorism was not only a reality, but growing in intensity.
“74.  In  2004,  there  was  a  major  escalation  in  our  understanding  of  the  scale  and 
nature of terrorist plotting in the UK with the discovery, early in the year that a group 
of British citizens were planning to make and detonate a large bomb. This required 
what was then the largest ever UK surveillance operation to control the threat posed 
by the plotters and to gather evidence to convict them. This  operation was called 
Operation Crevice …
“75. Later in 2004, there was another major investigation called Operation Rhyme 
which dismantled a terrorist network led by a veteran jihadist called Dhiren Barot, 
whose ambition was to mount attacks, including the use of radiological devices, both 
in the US and the UK. Both of these cases led to multi-defendant prosecutions which 
in all took over three years to come to a conclusion, and devoured huge amounts of 
investigative resource throughout that time.
“76.  These  cases  and  others  showed  a  clear  intention  on  the  part  of  terrorists  to 
attack the UK mainland to try to kill as many people as possible whenever possible …
“78. In July 2005, despite the best efforts of the UK counter terrorist community, London 
was twice attacked to devastating effect. The subsequent criminal investigation was 
the largest ever carried out in the UK, drawing in detective resources from across 
the country, and in effect lasted right through until the Inquest into the deaths of the 
victims of the 7/7 attacks was concluded in 2011.
“79. By early 2006, at exactly the time Operation Caryatid was developing, Operation 
Overt began. This was the next in line of what seemed like an interminable series 
of  potentially  devastating  plots.  This  one  turned  out  to  be  a  plan  to  blow  up, 
simultaneously, a number of transatlantic airliners en route from the UK to the USA 
… As with other major terrorist cases, the prosecutions in Operation Overt took a 
long time to come to fruition. In fact they took some 4 years and were spread over 7

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eseparate trials. This all needed a massive commitment of officers from the Counter 
Terrorism Command (SO15).
“80. The impact of this was that those of us who were charged with protecting the 
public  from  the  effects  of  terrorism  were  more  than  fully  committed  on  matters 
that directly affected the safety of the British public. Not only were we continually 
‘borrowing’ colleagues from other parts of the MPS, we also drafted in large numbers 
of officers from across the country. The impact of this on other policing operations 
was  at  times  severe.  For  instance,  during  the  surveillance  operation  in  support  of 
Operation Crevice in early 2004, every available surveillance team from within the 
MPS and indeed beyond was used on the enquiry. Investigations into drug trafficking, 
murder and other serious crime, including internal corruption enquiries, came second 
to the need to protect the public from terrorism.
“81. Despite all the support that was received throughout these years, and particularly 
after the attacks on London in 2005, by the time Goodman and Mulcaire were arrested 
in August 2006 the Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13) had some 70 live terrorist cases on its 
books, but insufficient resources to investigate them all. There was prioritisation even 
with life threatening terrorist cases, and that is the context within which the decisions 
that were taken to investigate possible invasions of privacy under Operation Caryatid 
must be considered.”

5.4 

5.5 

5.6 

Elaborating on this statement, it is clear that, since 2004, there had been repeated attempts 
by Al-Qaeda networks to commit mass casualty suicide attacks. These included the fertiliser 
bomb  plot  (Operation  Crevice)  and  Dhiren  Barot  and  the  dirty  bomb  plots  (Operation 
Rhyme).233 On 7 July and 21 July 2005, there was a series of coordinated suicide terrorist 
attacks and follow up attacks. Operation Crevice alone used every single surveillance team in 
London and most of those from the areas around London and Mr Clarke had “borrowed” over 
1,000 officers from other forces to support the investigation into the attacks on 7 July 2005. 
By January 2007, 200 highly experienced and specialised officers continued to be on loan for 
this work.234 Mr Hayman described in evidence the terrorist threat as “unprecedented”.235

Lord Reid, endorsed the evidence of the police, saying that the scale of the terrorist threat and 
ensuing counter-terrorist operations had been “well set out by others who had testified”.236 
He  explained  that  the  threat  level  of  a  terrorist  attack  during  2006  varied  only  from  the 
second highest level, “Severe”, to the highest, “Critical”, where an attack was deemed likely 
and  imminent.  He  said  the  great  fear  of  a  terrorist  attack  at  that  time  was  “superseding 
everything else”.237

This background is critical to an understanding of the operational context in which Mr Clarke 
had to consider whether and, if so, to what extent the investigation should continue beyond 
the very targeted prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire. Resources, however, were 
not the only problem.

5.9 

The evidential issues
By mid-September 2006, the police had tried, without success, to obtain evidence from NI 
to support their strong suspicion that NoTW staff (other than Mr Goodman) were involved 
in a conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages. The investigators, including DCS Williams,238 
did  not  dispute,  however,  that  they  had  material  that  implicated  other  journalists  and 
investigative leads that could have been followed. The following is a stock-take of the matters 
the investigators had specifically identified by that time.

The 11,000 pages of documents seized from Mr Mulcaire, taken together with the pattern 
of behaviour demonstrated by the call data obtained, created a picture of a trade craft, of 
someone who was building up the means unlawfully to access voicemail messages (and that 
in some cases he had utilised those means).

There was an inference that the “corner names” (so described because they were written 
in the corner of Mr Mulcaire’s notes) were those who had either instructed Mr Mulcaire or 
those who were the intended recipients of the information, or both. Not only did “Clive” 
appear as a corner name in relation to the Royal Household voicemail message interceptions 
but there were corner names associated with counts 16 to 20 on the indictment.

5.10  The hub phone at the NoTW had been used hundreds of times to call the voicemail boxes of 

individuals not related to the Royal Household.239

5.11  The phone records of Mr Mulcaire taken together with his papers (in which he had recorded 
the mobile phone numbers of other journalists) demonstrated that Mr Mulcaire had made 
calls to journalists other than Mr Goodman.240

5.12  The lack of cooperation on the part of NI with the investigation (both by interfering with the 
search of the Wapping offices and in their response, through Burton Copeland, to requests 
for documents and information which might implicate others at NI) bolstered the belief that 
the criminality permeated wider within NI than just Mr Goodman.

5.13  There were financial and editorial evidential leads available to the police relating to published 

articles and payments for them.

5.14  DCS Williams was correct to assert that in order to prosecute any of the individuals referred 
to by the corner names he would have needed to be in a position to prove cogently who they 
were241 and that they had requested or received the information in the knowledge that Mr 
Mulcaire obtained information through voicemail interception.242 He explained that what was 
absent from the seized material was any specific instructions to Mr Mulcaire to undertake 
any criminal activity that could be connected to a particular person, or “what it was he did 
and who he sent it to and how he billed it ...”243

the corner names in particular were the names of journalists at the NoTW. When pressed, he agreed that there was 
circumstantial evidence, but went on to say (as is undoubtedly the case) that he would have needed something more 
substantial in order to obtain a conviction. uploads/2012/02/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-29-February-2012.pdf

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E5.15  During his evidence, however, DCS Williams appeared to assert, that there was “no evidence” 
that other journalists were involved. For instance, it was put to him that it was likely, or at 
least a plausible picture, that Mr Mulcaire said to the journalist on the phone: “I’ve listened 
to celebrity X’s voicemail and this is what I can tell you is on the voicemail.” DCS Williams 
agreed that it was a plausible picture but stated that he had no evidence of that to put before 
a court.244 This has caused concern that DCS Williams failed to recognise the evidential value 
of the matters the police had established.

5.16  DCS Williams is emphatic that his use of the expression “no evidence” has been taken out of 
context and that he did not mean that there was no evidence whatsoever, but rather that 
such material as had been collected, was insufficient to prosecute. Given that DCS Williams 
was  plainly  aware  of  the  material  that  pointed  towards  other  journalists  and  was  correct 
in his assessment that a considerable amount of further work would have had to be done 
before a further prosecution  could  have been contemplated; I am prepared to  accept his 
submissions on this issue. Had he not been aware of the potential value of the evidential 
leads, he would not have considered it necessary to ask Mr Clarke to decide whether further 
resources should be committed to the investigation. DCS Williams may not have labelled or 
analysed the material in his own mind as circumstantial or inferential evidence but it would 
be wrong to find, in 2006 at least, that he did not appreciate that there was “some evidence”; 
as the section below demonstrates, however, that made no difference to the decision made 
by Mr Clarke.

5.17  Similarly,  in  his  evidence  DI  Maberly  explained  that  he  believed  that  three  of  the  corner 
names in particular were the names of journalists at the NoTW245 but went on to say: “We 
had  some  inference;  we  had  no  evidence”.246  When  pressed,  he  agreed  that  there  was 
circumstantial evidence, but went on to say (as is undoubtedly the case) that he would have 
needed something more substantial in order to obtain a conviction.

5.18 

I conclude this section by emphasising that it would not be fair to seek to infer from the fact 
that a number of prosecutions are now being undertaken that the conclusions then reached 
by the officers were wrong, let alone that they were not objectively and fairly reached. It is 
obviously important not to prejudice or appear to pre-judge the criminal process by expressing 
too robust a view of the material then (or now) available. There was, in my judgment, more 
than enough in the Mulcaire documents to justify further work which could, itself, have led to 
further evidence being uncovered, but that is a long way from saying that it would then have 
been appropriate to go further; it is even further removed from being able to suggest that the 
decision not to do so was wrong.

The decision
If the investigation was to continue, DCS Williams was of the view that the next step would be 
a detailed analysis of the documents seized from Mr Mulcaire. He said:247

5.19 

“I knew that we would need to go through that material again, and that we would 
have to do all the research in exactly the same way we’d done around the phone

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEworks to see what that showed. Then I would have a better picture of is there actually 
something here that I can either take to a judge in a production order or, probably 
more realistically, I would have taken that investigation forward, assuming that there 
is something more in that material, in terms of arresting people.”

5.20  DCS Surtees was also of the view that pursuing the evidential leads would have required a 
“step-change” in the investigation, which would include a thorough analysis of the material 
seized from Mr Mulcaire. For instance, he considered that the “guilty knowledge” of those 
identified  by  the  corner  names  would  be  difficult  to  prove  and  would  require  a  full  scale 
criminal investigation sanctioned by senior officers in SO13.248 He said:249

“… in terms of widening the suspect pool, that is a protracted piece of work, because we’d 
have to go through the whole process again of trying to identify, et cetera.”

5.21  This  analysis  of  the  material  seized  would  have  to  have  preceded  an  application  for  a 
production order because the court would expect the police to have a clear idea of what 
they already had in their possession before seeking to compel the production of journalistic 
material. The law requires the police to make proportionate applications, which focus on what 
is strictly required. The law does not permit wide-ranging, speculative “fishing expeditions”.250 
The Operation Caryatid investigators would not have been in a position to identify what was 
strictly required until they had ascertained what evidence they already had.251

5.22  Against  that  background,  DCS  Williams  and  DCS  Surtees  briefed  Mr  Clarke,  Commander 
McDowell and DCS White as to the current state of the evidence. DCS Williams said that senior 
management were aware that the investigators believed that NI had not been cooperating 
with the investigation. DCS Surtees said that during the briefing:252

“…  it  was  made  very  clear  that,  given  the  unprecedented  amount  of  operations 
currently live within SO13 and the huge demand this was having on the CT command, 
this matter was not to be investigated beyond the original parameters. Moreover, 
all efforts were put into preparing the prosecution case to ensure the conviction of 
Mulcaire and Goodman.”

5.23  Mr Clarke explained that in order properly to analyse the material and to be in a position to 
present it as evidence in a prosecution, it would have been necessary to index the material 
(manually, because at that time there was no way of scanning documents onto the HOLMES 
system); cross-reference it; research every phone number and subject it to an individual RIPA 
application to obtain data; and then analyse that data.253 Mr Clarke said that it would have 
been an “an enormous undertaking”.254

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E5.24  On the question of the possibility of requesting support from elsewhere in the police service, 
Mr Clarke quoted in his witness statement from his evidence before the Home Affairs Select 
Committee in July 2011:

“I took the view that it would be completely unrealistic, given that we were heading 
towards a prosecution of Goodman and Mulcaire, to then go to another department 
and say, ‘We’ve got a prosecution running. We have a huge amount of material here 
that  needs  analysing.  We  don’t  know,  given  the  uncertainties  of  the  legal  advice, 
whether there will  be  further  offences  coming  from  this  or  not.  Would  you  like to 
devote 50, 60, 70 officers for a protracted period to do this?’ I took the judgment that 
that would be an unreasonable request and so I didn’t make it.”

5.25  Mr Clarke gave more detail about his rationale in his witness statement:255

“…  First,  given  the  wider  context  of  counter  terrorist  operations  that  posed  an 
immediate threat to the British public, when set against a criminal course of conduct 
that involved gross breaches of privacy but no apparent threat of physical harm to 
the public, I could not justify the huge expenditure of resources this would entail over 
an inevitably protracted period. Instead a team of officers were detailed to examine 
the documents for any further evidence, and to identify potential victims where there 
might be security concerns.
“Secondly, the original objectives of the investigation could be achieved through the 
following measures:
 

The  very  public  prosecution  and  imprisonment  of  a  senior  journalist  from  a 
national newspaper for these offences;
“Collaboration  with  the  mobile  phone  industry  to  prevent  such  invasions  of 
privacy in the future; and
Briefings to Government, including the Home Office and Cabinet Office designed 
to alert them to this activity and to ensure that national security concerns could 
be addressed.”

 

 

5.26  He added in evidence that the investigation “… was, to be honest, not anywhere near the 
top of our level – our concerns because, remember, we are dealing with the airline plot and a 
whole range of other terrorist operations at that time”.256

5.27  A legitimate concern has been expressed that Mr Clarke’s decision was underpinned by a 
briefing from DCS Williams,257 and therefore that he might have been told by DCS Williams 
that the investigation had uncovered “no evidence” implicating other journalists, or, if DCS 
Williams at least mentioned the evidential leads (which, as it happens, I do not doubt that 
he did), he would have expressed a cautious view of their potential value or viability. The 
first point to note is that throughout the investigation Mr Clarke (and indeed DCS White and 
Commander McDowell) received regular briefings, from both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees, 
at which the evidence and potential direction of the investigation were discussed (and at 
which decisions were made to limit the investigation). It is therefore not the case that before

257 whether directly or through Commander McDowell and DCS White

314

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEbeing briefed in September/October 2006 Mr Clarke had no idea of the potential evidential 
leads.258

5.28  The precise content of the briefing received by Mr Clarke cannot now be ascertained, but the 
evidence given by Mr Clarke demonstrates that even with the fullest understanding of the 
quality of the evidence, his decision would have been the same. His reaction to questions on 
this issue was that he had enough information to make a properly informed decision:259

“Even though I didn’t know some of the intimate details of the case, and indeed details 
which, with hindsight, you could say were very important, I still think I had enough 
information available to me to make the overall decision about the future direction of 
the inquiry, because I still can’t see any way in which we could have done that without 
exhaustive analysis of all of that material.”

5.29  Mr  Clarke  agreed  that  it  probably  followed  that  even  if  one  could  fairly  characterise  the 
evidence, particularly in relation to the three journalists, as strong circumstantial or inferential, 
that his decision not to pursue them would have been exactly the same:260

“… Strong circumstantial evidence in terms of trying to prove a conspiracy within a 
major newspaper group, it might – it won’t get you, I would suggest, it would be very 
unlikely to get you to the position of a successful prosecution.”

5.30  He was asked whether from reviewing the decision logs in preparation for the Select Committee 
hearing and having heard some of the evidence from the investigating officers during the 
Inquiry, he had a different impression or understanding of the quality of the evidence insofar 
as other journalists were concerned. Mr Clarke answered as follows:261

“It’s told me that there’s more information there … What I can say is that I haven’t 
seen anything which would cause me to make a different decision than the one I did 
then in terms of the allocation and resources, and I say that because we referred 
earlier to the overall strategy, which was to try to bring this criminality to an end by 
the prosecution of a senior, high-profile journalist, through working with the industry 
and through passing information to government.”

5.31 

I asked Mr Clarke whether, in fact, the decision was not even close, not because of the quality 
of the evidence but because he was coping with 70 terrorist operations on a monumental 
scale. Mr Clarke said that this was very close to being “spot on”:262

“…  because  the  minutiae  of  whether  there  was  circumstantial  evidence  against 
journalist A, B or C is a minor consideration in comparison with the consideration of 
what poses a threat to the lives of the British public. Invasions of privacy are odious, 
obviously. They can be extraordinarily distressing and at time they can be illegal, but, 
to put it bluntly, they don’t kill you. Terrorists do.”

5.32  Mr Clarke continued by explaining that it would have taken “a huge amount of very strong, 
compelling  evidence  to  persuade  me  that  we  should  take  a  different  course”.  Even  that, 
however, would not have guaranteed that the matter would have been investigated further, 
only that he would have had better grounds to approach another part of the police service 

258 Further, DCS Surtees has specifically emphasised that he discussed his view of the outstanding leads in detail with 
DCS White “and other supervisors” in August/September 2006

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eand suggest that the enormous resources required should be dedicated to the problem.263 
Mr Clarke said:264

“If officers had come to me and said: ‘Look, we have very clear technical evidence 
here that these journalists are involved in phone hacking’, that would have given me 
something more then to try to move the operation somewhere else, something to 
explain to colleagues why they should devote their own precious resources to what 
would inevitably be an enormous operation, but that simply wasn’t there.”

5.33 

It  is  also  worth  noting  that  both  the  SIO  and  his  deputy  clearly  agreed  with  Mr  Clarke’s 
decision. DCS Williams put it this way:265

“… ultimately the decision was Mr Clarke’s and I have worked with him since 2004. He 
is the most professional man that I’ve ever worked for, and I have absolute confidence 
in his integrity. I totally agreed with his decision-making. We were all acutely aware 
of the very difficult decisions that ultimately he would have to make and the rationale 
for it, and I do agree with it.”

5.34  DCS Surtees also agreed, stating that given the 70 priority terrorism investigations on-going 
at that time: “… it would have been absolute folly to prioritise the outstanding parts of this 
investigation to the detriment of the life threatening investigations.” 266 He went on to make 
it clear that, despite Mr Clarke’s evident reputation for integrity, he would not have accepted 
without challenge what he perceived to be a perverse decision. He said:267

“Had I been concerned about the legitimacy or otherwise of that decision, I would 
have taken that elsewhere. What I mean by that is I clearly am alive to the fact that 
we have got lines of investigation that had not been pursued in this case. The lines of 
investigation could have been pursued, and, as a detective, I would like to have pursued 
them. If Peter Clarke had made a decision based on resource, and my experience was 
that there was lots of resource, and I thought the decision was perverse, then I would 
have taken that elsewhere. That was absolutely not my position when the decision 
was communicated down to me. I was fully aware of where we were within the anti-
terrorism branch or counter terrorism command at that time.”

5.35  Neither Mr Hayman nor Lord Blair had any apparent input into this decision. Mr Hayman could 
not recall a conversation with Mr Clarke about the possible widening of the investigation to 
embrace other journalists268 and had not appreciated the significance of what the investigation 
had  turned  up  at the time (in  relation  to  the number  of  potential  victims and  the corner 
names of journalists). Even if he had, he would have accepted the decision made by Mr Clarke 
not to widen the investigation because he was one of the people weighing up the competing 
demands on resources.269

5.36  Lord Blair said that because of the huge pressures from Operation Overt, any conversation 
about the evidence in Operation Caryatid would have been “way back on the agenda and

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawErelatively short, particularly because the matter was being successfully dealt with and closed 
down, and that was how it was – I understood it to be”.270 Lord Blair said that it never occurred 
to him to ask whether there was further evidence of similar offences or offenders and nor 
was  he  told  that  that  was  the  case.  He  said  that  these  were  “fragmentary  conversations 
about something which was considered of relatively minor importance in comparison to the 
unfolding threats of mass casualty terrorism”.271

5.37  Lord  Blair  expressed  the  view  in  his  evidence  that  although  the  decision  Mr  Clarke  made 
was a reasonable one,272 it would have been open to Mr Clarke to escalate the matter to Mr 
Hayman, the Deputy Commissioner or up to him, any of whom might have decided to hand 
the investigation to another part of the organisation, possibly the specialist crime directorate, 
for a scoping study in due course.273 Lord Blair said that:

“It could have been taken out and parked. I just do want to get across that I am not … 
blaming Peter for this. I am merely saying another course of action could have been 
taken, and perhaps at that stage the information would have come out about there 
being lots more names and indications of a lot more people involved and then things 
would have been very different.”274

5.38  Whilst  an  alternative  course  may  have  been  available  to  Mr  Clarke,  it  would  not  be 
right  to  criticise  Mr  Clarke  in  any  way  for  taking  that  course  in  the  circumstances  he  has 
described. He was an impressive witness. His evidence regarding the terrorist threat to life 
and his prioritisation decision was given with force and in a convincing manner. I conclude 
unhesitatingly not only that Mr Clarke was entitled to reach the decision that he did but that, 
to such extent as it is appropriate for me to express an opinion, he was right to decide that no 
further anti-terrorist resources would be committed to investigating the breaches of privacy 
occasioned by voicemail interception. Even if the potency of the potential evidential leads 
were not explained during the briefing, that fact made no difference to the outcome.

5.39  There  was  no  question  that  Mr  Clarke  had  to  satisfy  the  demand  for  resources  that  the 
terrorist threat presented and that he was forced to make resourcing decisions that might 
not have been justifiable if the quantum of the threat were not so large. It was so clearly the 
correct decision that there is simply no scope for concluding that the decision was in any way 
influenced by the relationships between some senior officers and NI staff. I have no doubt, in 
any event, that Mr Clarke would not have countenanced such a factor having any bearing on 
his decision-making.275

Recording the decision

5.40  Mr Clarke said that his belief was that, in the final analysis, Commander McDowall and DCS 
White would have briefed him and he would have said to them: “Okay, go and see the SIOs,

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Etell them that we’re not going to go into the enormous exercise that going through all that 
material would involve”.276 Mr Clarke believes that he made this “ultimate decision” around 
the end of September 2006;277 DCS Williams believed that it was “around September, possibly 
October”.278

5.41  Mr Clarke went on to say that although briefing meetings were not themselves documented 
or the subject of minutes, he would expect the product of those meetings to be recorded in 
the SIO’s decision log.279 DCS Williams has contended that it would have been for Mr Clarke, 
as the decision-maker, to record the decision. In this case, for whatever reason, it did not 
happen:  there  is  thus  no  contemporaneous  written  record  of  Mr  Clarke’s  decision  or  its 
rationale. Neither is this failure simply bureaucratic: in my judgment, it was significant because 
the  absence  of  any  written  explanation  of  the  rationale  behind  the  decision  but  also  the 
evidential stage that the investigation had reached along with details of the outstanding leads 
may well have had important consequences in 2009, when the then Assistant Commissioner, 
John  Yates,  was  tasked  with  establishing  the  facts  around  Operation  Caryatid.280  It  was 
also important for another reason: it deprived the police of an important protection from 
allegations of impropriety, which, in this case, have caused serious damage to the reputation 
of the MPS.

5.42 

It follows that I entirely endorse Mr Clarke’s comment that where the police decide not to 
deal with a particular piece of criminality by what might be described as the conventional 
course of arrest and prosecution, there may be circumstances where the rationale needs to 
be made clear to others, so that “the sorts of insinuations that have been made about my 
officers who conducted that inquiry in 2006 can more easily be shown to be baseless.”281

5.43  Sir Paul Stephenson made similar comments with which I also completely agree. He said:282

“…  what  do  you  then  do  with  those  matters  that  could  be  part  of  a  criminal 
investigation, but for very proper resourcing decisions you decide not to take that 
option, which is not unusual in many investigations, and I think that there are two 
relevant factors there: one, you have to ensure that if you are taking those matters 
elsewhere, from a crime prevention perspective or to change behaviour or to deal 
with victims in a better way, then you have to make sure you land those issues with 
those other agencies or government.
“Secondly … you have to try and ensure, I think, in the future that we make those 
decisions transparent so they can withstand this level of scrutiny.”

Other possible approaches

5.44  The two conclusions that led to the investigation being curtailed were, first, that it would 
have been essential to undertake a full and detailed analysis of Mr Mulcaire’s documentation

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEand, second, that considerable resources would have been required to do the work. Having 
regard to the allegations that have been made, however, it was necessary to test the extent 
to which those beliefs were both genuine and reasonable: having done so, it is only fair to 
record the answer. Thus, the officers were asked about the feasibility of investigative steps 
short of such an analysis.

5.45  They were also asked whether they could have arrested the three journalists from the NoTW 
identified by DI Maberly. The four detectives roundly rejected this is as a realistic option on 
the basis that, in all likelihood, the journalists would have made no comment in interview, 
as did Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire; the police would have been no further forward. In 
relation to this suggestion, Mr Clarke remarked:283

“Would it be reasonable, bearing in mind that we were being completely thwarted 
and receiving no co-operation from News International whatsoever, to go out and 
arrest two or three journalists, invite them to make a full and frank confession of 
what they’d been doing, because we wouldn’t, without analysis of all that material, 
have  substantial  issues  to  put  to  them?  It  would  be  a  complete  reverse  of  good 
investigative practice to do that.”

5.46  DCS Williams said:284

“My opinion is that to do a proper and professional investigation to interview anyone, 
it  has  to  be  done  from  a  position  of  knowledge,  and  that  in  many  investigations 
simply going and asking someone to give an explanation quite often results in ‘no 
comment’, in exactly the same way in my early decision logs I could have gone and 
seen Mr Goodman and it is highly unlikely that we would have got very far in the 
investigation.”

5.47  DCS Williams continued:285

“This  is  my  personal  belief  as  an  investigator,  and  maybe  others  will  judge  my 
threshold is too high, but given my experience of investigations and presenting a case 
before a court, I obviously have a personal higher threshold than others as to what I 
believe in terms of the right thing to do in terms of reasonable ground before I start 
depriving other people of their liberty. I do understand that you are arguing to me 
that there is a lower threshold and I could have arrested and interviewed.”

5.48  DCS Surtees said:286

“Whilst the most probable explanation for the corner names was that journalists at 
NOTW were in receipt of this information and that they could be aware of the illegal 
practises  [sic],  the  difficulty  was  proving  this.  This  would  have  meant  potentially 
arresting those journalists listed on Mulcaire’s documents. To affect [sic] this there 
would need to be a full scale criminal investigation.”

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E5.49  DI Maberly made the following observations on this subject:287

“There would have been aspects of the case that I would have liked to have asked them 
about, but I had no firm evidence of either their knowledge of voicemail interception 
or of them tasking Mr Mulcaire. This is something that I would have looked to find 
before speaking to them, because it would have been the case that, you know, if we 
did bring them in for questioning, the likelihood is that they would have made no 
comment, as did the other two employees of News of the World. We would have got 
nowhere.”

5.50 

I have no difficulty in accepting that this collective view that there would have been nothing 
to gain from arresting the three journalists, without further investigation, was (as Mr Clarke 
pointed out) in keeping with good investigative practice; it was both reasonable and entirely 
honestly held.

5.51  As a further possibility, it was put to DCS Williams that he could have asked the NoTW to 
provide  him  with  a  list  of  journalists,  perhaps  limited  to  particular  desks.  DCS  Williams 
explained that he would need more than a corner name that happened to be the first name 
of someone employed by the paper:288

“To  put  together  a  criminal  investigation,  I  wouldn’t  just  use  that  one  facet.  There 
would be a whole range of questions and things that I would want to get put together 
to have a cogent case as to now why am I speaking to this individual. Not simply the 
fact that their name is – I’m making this up – Bill, because that’s on a corner name, and 
they happen to be Bill someone employed in this papers. I would need more than that.”

5.52  He repeated that he would have wanted to go through all the material because:289

“That is a proper and professional way of carrying out a criminal investigation. It’s not 
done piecemeal or bit by bit. It’s done exhaustively, in exactly the way that actually 
it’s being done subsequently.”

5.53  Whilst I do not accept that, of necessity, furthering the investigation was “all or nothing”, and 
that certain preliminary steps could not have been taken to see what they yielded, I have no 
doubt that DCS Williams honestly held the view that the only satisfactory approach was to 
examine the Mulcaire archive both systematically and comprehensively.

5.54  The next possibility, suggested to DCS Surtees was that he could have obtained the call data 
in relation to a limited number of victims listed in the blue book and see who else might 
have been calling into their voicemail boxes.290 DCS Surtees explained that the phone records 
for a given individual reveal thousands of lines of incoming telephone calls. Identifying any 
given incoming caller requires a separate RIPA authorisation (which itself was a “laborious 
process” because the police needed to account for their wish to intrude into the privacy of 
the individual).291 He stated that the only feasible approach, therefore, was to start with the

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEsuspect’s number and look to see whether that number had accessed the voicemail account 
of the potential victim.292

5.55  DCS  Surtees  agreed  that  the  potential  victim  concerned  could  be  asked  to  exclude  the 
numbers they recognised.293 However, he also pointed out that the phone records would not 
show which of the incoming calls were seeking remote access to voicemail and which were 
ordinary phone calls to the victim. Only Vodafone’s “Vampire” data were able to show the 
details of calls into voicemail boxes.294 It follows that it was quite likely that even after the 
individual had eliminated all the numbers he or she could recognise, the police would be left 
with many numbers which may or may not have called the voicemail box. A RIPA application 
would then have had to be made on a speculative basis, which may well have been insufficient 
to satisfy the officer charged with deciding whether to grant a RIPA authorisation, because 
the number could quite easily belong to an entirely innocent party.

5.56  DCS Surtees was also asked whether he considered and discussed with his senior officers 
a more limited investigation in the first instance, for example by targeting the most senior 
journalists, because he would be able to find out their relevant phone numbers. He could not 
remember what conversations there were around scoping a possible future investigation or 
the extent of such an investigation. He said: “I certainly can’t remember going into – we could 
have a major investigation or we could have a smaller investigation.”295 Again, taking account 
of the response of DCS Surtees to the questions on this topic, that to the extent that he, and 
indeed DCS Williams, did not consider whether steps short of a major investigation might be 
feasible, the absence of such consideration was based on a judgment made in good faith and 
was not influenced by any desire to protect or propitiate NI.

5.57  The tenor of the evidence of Mr Clarke was that he agreed with DCS Williams and DCS Surtees. 
Mr Clarke was asked whether it would have been possible to carry out a more abbreviated 
analysis,  looking  at  a  sample  of  victims  and  the  three  journalists  in  the  sight  lines  of  DI 
Maberly. His response was:296

“… Well, potentially, but I don’t see how you could take part of that material and 
subject  it  to  analysis  with  all  the  cross-referencing  and  so  on  that  would  have  to 
happen, and so inevitably I think it would lead to an analysis of all the material.”

5.58  Mr Clarke agreed, when challenged, that there could have been a more limited and streamlined 

analysis of the material which focussed on the three journalists. He said:297

“I see what you’re saying and with hindsight there are probably all sorts of approaches 
that could have been taken, but in the light of what I was aware of at the time, what 
I knew and the competing demands, I made the decision that we would not do so.”

5.59  However, he subsequently re-stated his initial position, namely that the investigation could 

not have moved forwards without an exhaustive analysis of the material.298

5.60 

I am not in a position to judge whether further tentative enquiries would have borne sufficient 
fruit to prosecute other journalists without there being a disproportionate drain on resources.

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid EWhat  matters  insofar  as  the  Terms  of  Reference  are  concerned  is  whether  the  detectives 
honestly held the views that they did (rather than whether their views were necessarily well-
founded) and were not influenced by any relationships between senior officers within the 
MPS  and  NI.  The  evidence  I  heard  from  each  of  them,  and  how  they  have  justified  their 
decisions, gives me no cause to doubt that their decisions were unaffected by the fact that 
the target of the further investigation would have been NI journalists or editors.

5.61 

It is fair to add that DCS Williams also had concerns about whether the huge resource injection 
that he believed would be required to take the investigation further would be justified by what 
such an investigation might realistically yield (which itself might have added to his cautious 
approach). He said:299

“All along, I – we had some grounds to suspect that this could be wider and that 
indeed if we undertook further research we may find something. What I didn’t know 
and what I was clear about is what we would find, and actually what it would amount 
to. What I was very cognisant of, as indeed we all were, was the amount of work it 
had taken to get us to where we were, particularly in terms of the technical difficulties.
“The other dimension that we were very conscious of is we had achieved that in a 
covert operation, where nobody knew what we were doing, nobody understood what 
we were looking for, and they couldn’t hide evidence. At the moment this was now 
very clear about what we were doing and what evidence we were looking for, and it is 
not unreasonable to think that it would be a far more challenging operation in terms 
of the implication of the resources that you would need.”

5.62  DCS Williams went further because, when asked whether there was any sense that he was 
taking  on  a  large  and  powerful  organisation  and  that  there  were  dangers  in  doing  so,  he 
said:300

“I  think  with  any  large  organisation,  yes,  we  were  aware  of  it  in  terms  of  a  big 
organisation,  which  is  why  we  carried  out  such  a  thorough  investigation,  why  we 
sought so much advice from the CPS, in particular in terms of when it came to our 
arrest phase, because we wanted to be able to seize as much evidence as possible 
and do it in a proper and professional manner so that we could not be criticised for 
the way we carried out our investigation.”

5.63 

I accept the evidence that, if anything, the fact that he was investigating a large organisation 
made it all the more important that DCS Williams did a good job, both in terms of the way the 
investigation was conducted and in ensuring that the evidence was sound. Reading between 
the lines, it was likely to have been within his contemplation that if there were any flaws 
in the investigation process or the evidence, they would be exploited to the fullest extent 
possible by the organisation’s legal team. It is likely that this mind set also contributed to the 
cautious approach that DCS Williams took to the evidence.

5.64  Finally,  it  has  been  argued  that  all  that  would  have  been  needed  to  include  additional 
journalists on the indictment would have been to ask NI for a list of journalists and cross-
refer the list with the corner names. It is suggested that this would be virtually the same 
evidence as was used to convict Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire. It is right, as DCS Williams

the evidence implicating Mr Goodman in the conspiracy went significantly beyond his name 
appearing in the top corner of Mr Mulcaire’s notes.

5.65 

Influence of News International
It has also been argued that there is a strong implication that the conduct of DCS Williams 
(in telling counsel, the CPS and subsequently Mr Yates that there was no evidence that any 
other journalists were involved and in later not pursuing the agreed strategy of informing 
victims) derived from his fear of the powerful media friends of his superiors and reflects a 
wider institutional fear of NI and his awareness of the close social relationships fostered by 
the company with his superiors. It has been contended that although there is no evidence 
that DCS Williams made any conscious decision to suppress evidence, it is inevitable that the 
relationships exerted some influence on his decision-making.

5.66 

In relation to this aspect of the case, I reject these arguments. First, quite apart from whether 
DCS  Williams  was  aware  of  any  close  social  relationships,  if  such  there  were,  there  is  no 
evidence that any decision that he made as to the investigation was not entirely justifiable 
on logical and reasonable grounds; from the outset, he pursued it vigorously and effectively. 
The ultimate decision (as it has been called) was made by Mr Clarke. As to the attitude to the 
investigation, DCS Williams said that:302

“… no one in my team had any contact with any of the newspapers, and I can assure 
you at no time in that investigation was it ever an issue, did we ever discuss it, did it 
ever influence the direction that we went in with that investigation.”

5.67  Second, DCS Williams did not suppress evidence; and I have accepted that DCS Williams was 
not intending to convey to counsel or the CPS that there was no evidence whatsoever to 
implicate other journalists, only that there was insufficient evidence to lay before a criminal 
Court.303

5.68  Suffice to say, having seen the senior members of the investigating team, I have no doubt 
that they approached their task with complete integrity. Neither do I doubt their enthusiasm 
or their desire to investigate the criminality before them to the fullest extent possible within 
the limits of the resources available to them. I am satisfied that had Mr Clarke, at the end of 
September 2006, sanctioned the exhaustive analysis of the documentation seized from Mr 
Mulcaire, the investigators would have embarked on that task with the zeal and rigour they 
had demonstrated since Operation Caryatid had begun.

5.69  Given how little was known about voicemail interception when the investigation began in 
December 2005 and the challenges involved in understanding how the interceptions were 
taking place and then proving the interceptions, it could only have been (and was) a robust, 
tenacious, well-motivated and skilful team that could have secured such extensive evidence 
that Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire were driven to admit their guilt. I do not find they 
were deterred in their investigation by fear of getting on the wrong side of such a powerful 
organisation  or  displeasing  senior  management  by  risking  damage  to  the  MPS’s  working 
relationship with NI.

301 pp98-99, lines 11-6, ibid
302 p106, lines 17-21, ibid
303 The context in which DCS Williams used the phrase “no evidence” was rather different in 2009, however, when DCS 
Williams was briefing John Yates. This is explored in section 8 below

323

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E5.70  As an indication of DCS Surtees’ enthusiasm in particular, I note that he said in evidence that, 

when producing his search strategy:304

“I wanted very much to get into News International, because I wanted to search the 
desk, I wanted to search the financial areas, I wanted to find evidence around who 
was involved in this illegal activity.”

5.71  Also,  when  asked  whether  he  would  have  liked  there  to  have  been  a  full  scale  criminal 
investigation into other journalists, his answer was: “absolutely”. He explained, however, that 
he understood the priorities:305

“So in terms of what I would have liked to have done coupled with my obligations and 
the seriousness of the investigations I was involved in, I knew where my priorities lay, 
and those were with the issues of serious threat to life investigations. That’s where I 
needed to be and that’s where my staff needed to be.”

5.72  On  this  topic,  Mr  Clarke  observed  that:  “[the  investigating  officers]  conducted  an  honest 
inquiry, they were uninfluenced, as was I, by anything to do with News International or any 
media group.”306 In the context of his evidence about the perception caused by his relationships 
with individuals from NI, Mr Hayman stressed:307

“I can absolutely accord with your point around perception, but I can tell you that 
the team on it are ferocious, they have a reputation of being ferocious, and if, let’s 
say, there is a scenario, which some people have argued around the conspiracy that 
there was a not such ferociousness around because of a perceived relationship, it 
was  impossible,  in  my  view.  If  you  wanted  to  be  disproportionate  towards  those 
alleged perpetrators, or you wanted to dilute down the investigation, the security and 
parameters that were set by the SIO would make that impossible. And if I personalise 
that, if there was an agenda from me or any other person, Assistant Commissioner, 
who  wanted  to  dilute  or  disproportionately  ramp  up  that  operation,  it  would  be 
impossible for that to happen without the SIO calling foul or asking for that individual 
to record why they want something done in that decision log.”

5.73  Because  of  the  serious  concern  expressed,  this  aspect  of  the  police  operation  has  been 
examined in detail. In the circumstances, I ought finally to record the views of the independent 
Queen’s Counsel instructed to advise and conduct the prosecution, who dealt with the officers 
on a regular basis. David Perry QC said of the police and CPS staff involved: 308

“… my impression throughout this case, which was not an easy case, given all the 
sensitivities as well as the technical aspects and the difficult issues of law, was that 
everyone  involved,  both  at  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  and  in  the  police,  were 
conscientiously attempting to do their jobs professionally and with some skill, and 
my distinct impression at the end of it all was that it was an example of collaborative 
efforts on the part of the Crown Prosecution Service and the police that had led on

I found everyone involved highly skilled, competent and professional.”

6.	 Police	strategy	for	the	aftermath

6.1 

The victim notification strategy
In  order  to  examine  how  the  police  intended  to  address  issues  concerning  the  victims  of 
voicemail  interception,  it  is  necessary  to  return  to  24  August  2006  (three  days  after  the 
conference with counsel) on which date DCS Williams met with Mr Clarke and DCS White. 
Mr  Clarke’s  recollection  is  that  the  purpose  of  the  meeting  was  to  devise  and  produce  a 
victim notification strategy.309 Mr Clarke said that he agreed the strategy at the meeting310 
and expected it to be implemented and seen through.311 He said that:312

“Bearing in mind that there had been very close co-operation between my officers 
and the mobile phone industry throughout the investigation, it was agreed that after 
the arrests there would be a strategy for informing victims whereby police officers 
would inform certain categories of potential victim, and the mobile phone companies 
would identify and inform others.”

6.2  Mr Clarke was asked whether it was his intention that the 418 names on the original list of 
potential victims, which was prepared shortly after 8 August 2006, would be notified one way 
or the other, either directly by the police or by the mobile phone companies. Mr Clarke said: 
“Yes, absolutely”.313 Mr Clarke said that he did not have any oversight over the execution of 
the strategy because he would not be expected to do so and by then he was fully immersed 
in Operation Overt.314

6.3 

DCS  Williams  said  that  he  wrote  the  outcome  of  the  discussion  in  a  document  entitled 
“Informing  Potential  Victims”.315  Given  that  Mr  Clarke  had  no  further  involvement  in  the 
victim notification strategy after that meeting, it does not appear that he saw the document 
or was asked to agree the detail of the strategy. The following are material extracts from the 
document:

“Situation
…
Material seized during the executive action phase of Op Caryatid has been assessed 
and at this stage there are approximately 180 potential victims whose details are 
recorded by Mulcaire.

325

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid EThere is a need to establish definitely how many victims there are, i.e. how many 
people have had their voicemails (UVNs) rung by Mulcaire/Goodman. With that in 
mind all 5 of the UK mobile phone companies have been asked to search their UVN 
equivalents for any of our ‘suspect’ phone numbers calling them going as far back as 
possible – up to one year, dependant [sic] upon data retention. Time frame – up to 3 
weeks, but variable due to Op Overt.
…
Using  the  information  that  will  come  from  the  mobile  phone  service  providers 
together with an assessment of material seized, police/Council [sic] can choose an 
appropriate range of ‘victims’ – subject to their agreement – to add to the charges. 
The list of victims will then represent the most definitive list of people who have had 
their voicemails ‘intercepted’.
There is arguably a duty to inform people when they have been a victim of crime and 
in this case I believe that duty should be undertaken for those people who we know 
are victims by virtue of the fact that our suspects called their voicemails (UVNs). That 
list  will  be  identified  as  above  and  the  next  step  is  to  decide  when  and  how  they 
should be informed.
“Issues to bear in mind if informing victims
Informing all of the victims could be resource intensive which SO13 can ill afford at 
this juncture given the current terrorist threat.
From  all  that  is  known,  the  risk  to  the  victims  does  not  extend  to  a  risk  to  life  or 
serious injury/damage to property, but rather the goal of the criminality is to seek 
material of media interest – typically salacious gossip!
Arguably any immediate and future risk has been negated by virtue of the fact that 
police now hold the suspects data on their victims and the fact that they have been 
detected acts as a deterrent for them or anyone else to target these victims.
Although  the  techniques  for  voicemail  interception  may  not  be  limited  to  these 
suspects it is unlikely these two will have shared them with a wider audience given 
the potential earning value of the technique. Equally our investigation to date has not 
identified any other suspects calling the UVNs of our main victims.
There is a rationale for saying that the risk to victims has been significantly reduced 
due to police action and therefore a more measured and proportionate approach can 
be taken in terms of who and when the victims are informed.
Options
In terms of the, who and when, the following are options:–

1.  Given the rationale outlined above, do not inform any victims beyond those 

who will be used in the prosecution.

2.  As per 1 above, but extend the victims to be informed to include anyone who 
falls into the category of MP, Royal Household, Police and Military on the basis 
that although there is nothing to suspect personal safety or national security 
is being targeted, these are people for whom being those aspects could be 
a collateral risk. The latter four categories would include those that are on 
Mulcaire’s  list  whether  or  not  any  investigation  shows  that  their  UVN  has 
been dialled.
Inform all victims i.e. whose voicemails have been called.

3. 

326

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE4.  As per 3 above, but vary the when and how. The four categories identified in 
option 2 should be informed now and the remainder can be informed once 
the definitive list is complete following responses from the phone companies. 
Police would lead on informing the former group whereas the latter group 
could be informed by the respective ‘victim’ phone company via an agreed 
police/mobile phone companies’ letter.

Recommended Option
Option 4 is my preferred option because:–
It deals with the risks to individuals in a proportionate manner.
Is a proportionate use of police resources that are hard pressed across the MPS?
The responsibility and resource implications are shared with the phone companies.
The phone companies are the most effective and efficient means of contacting the 
victims in the majority of cases.
Police have the appropriate channels to contact the police/military/MP/Royal victims.

6.4 

DCS Williams explained in his witness statement that:316

“… I felt that there was arguably a duty to inform people who may have been a victim 
of crime in this case and I felt that this was best defined by ‘for those people who 
we know are victims by virtue of the fact that our suspects called their voicemails.’ 
If those people could be identified it was a case of by whom, how and when those 
people  would  be  informed.  The  rationale  for  such  a  distinction  was  based  upon  a 
proportionate sharing of the resources that would be required, the level of risk/harm 
and who, police or service providers, had the best discrete [sic] channels to carry out 
the task.”

6.5 

He provided additional insight into his thinking at the time during the course of his briefing to 
the Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, in 2009:317

“At  the  time  the  strategy  recognised  that  there  was  still  extensive  research  to  be 
done with the phone companies to identify what the full extent of victims might be 
and therefore as outlined under the section above ‘How were victims identified’ this 
could be a vastly bigger group of people and in reality we would probably never know 
the true scale. This strategy was therefore seeking to alert potential past victims in a 
proportionate manner without causing undue alarm (i.e. contact via Phone Company 
as opposed to police) and set in motion measures within the overall mobile phone 
industry to prevent it happening in the future.”

6.6 

In summary therefore, the plan was for the police to notify immediately those identified in 
the blue book (the 418 individuals) who fell into the category of MP, Royal Household, Police 
and Military, regardless of whether there was evidence that their voicemail boxes had been 
dialled by the suspect numbers. Individuals outside those four categories would be notified 
provided their voicemail box had been rung by Mr Goodman or Mr Mulcaire or both318 but

6.8 

irrespective  of  whether  there  was  a  “new”  or  “old”  message  in  the  voicemail  box.319  DCS 
Williams explained that this latter group of victims would comprise those in the blue book 
whose voicemails had been rung by the suspect numbers (but who were not MPs, members 
of  the  Royal  Household,  police  of  military)  and  any  additional  individuals  that  the  phone 
companies brought to their attention.320 It was not sufficient that they merely appeared in 
the Mulcaire papers or were listed in the blue book.321 This latter group of individuals would 
be informed by their phone company, by way of a letter agreed between the police and the 
phone company, but not until the phone companies had responded to the request that they 
identify as many of their customers as they could whose voicemail boxes had been rung by 
the suspect numbers (so that a “definitive” list could be compiled).

I  find  that  it  was  reasonable  for  the  police  to  put  in  place  a  three-track  strategy  for  the 
prosecution: namely (i) conducting a high-profile but limited prosecution (limited in terms 
of victims named on the indictment); (ii) alerting the phone companies so that they could 
improve security and change their procedures as appropriate and (iii) warning people who 
were the subject of criminal attention. However, the victim notification strategy was both 
poorly thought out and scarcely executed.

The plan lacked coherence. A considerable amount of work had been invested in the blue 
book,  which  provided  a  list  of  potential  victims  (as  DCS  Surtees  intended).322  Plainly,  the 
police should have ensured that all those named in the blue book were notified and the plan 
should have been devised on that basis. I see no reason for believing that this would have 
been a disproportionate drain on resources. Instead, the detail of the strategy was such that 
it excluded people listed in the blue book but in respect of whom there was no evidence 
that  their  voicemails  had  been  called  by  the  suspect  numbers.323  The  strategy  therefore 
overlooked  people  who  were  identified  in  the  blue  book,  and  in  respect  of  whom  Mr 
Mulcaire had the wherewithal to access the voicemail accounts, but whose voicemails may 
have been accessed by an as yet unidentified suspect number, such as a number belonging 
to someone other than Mr Goodman or Mr Mulcaire. This ought to have been within DCS 
Williams’ contemplation given his strong suspicion that journalists other than Mr Goodman 
had been involved in voicemail interception. The strategy also overlooked the fact that the 
phone companies only held their records for a short period of time and it thereby excluded 
those whose voicemails had been accessed by the identified suspect numbers but at such an 
early date that the relevant records had not been retained.

6.9 

DCS Williams was asked why everyone named in the blue book was not notified. His response 
was:324

319 p74, lines 16-18, ibid. By implication, this was irrespective of whether there was a voicemail message at all. DCS 
Williams did not apply the narrow interpretation of s1 of RIPA when identifying ‘victims’. This was plainly the correct 
approach given that regardless of the applicability of s1 of RIPA, the accessing of any voicemail message amounts to a 
criminal offence under s1 of the CMA. Therefore, all individuals whose voicemail messages have been intercepted are 
victims of crime, irrespective of whether the messages concerned were intercepted before or after they were heard by 
the intended recipient

321 p64, lines 3-18, Keith Surtees, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/evidence/?witness=dcs-keith-surtees 
322 The list of names comprised people of interest to Mr Mulcaire, in respect of whom Mr Mulcaire either had the 
wherewithal to access their voicemails or was in the process of obtaining that wherewithal; p67, lines 4-16, http://
www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-29-February-2012.pdf 
323 The strategy did not therefore fulfil Mr Clarke’s intention that all 418 individuals listed in the blue book would be 
informed, which is a further indication that Mr Clarke did not agree the detail of the strategy
324 pp67-68, lines 22-7, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Transcript-of-Morning-

328

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE“But I believe the implementation of this strategy was all I’d got there is a snapshot 
in time from the material that we happened to have received. There could well be 
a  wider  pool  of  people  that  have  been  compromised  as  a  result  of  his  activity  or 
indeed anywhere else. So this strategy was aimed at the full potential of what those 
potential victims might be. So that’s where it’s actually in the when and the how that 
I’m seeking or I was hoping through this strategy to address that much wider pool of 
people, which would have included everybody on that list.”

This answer suggests that DCS Williams failed to recognise that the ambit of the strategy 
simply did not encompass, even theoretically, everyone identified in the blue book.

6.10  Without suggesting to DCS Surtees that it was his responsibility to do so, it was put to him 
that it would not have been an enormous task to contact everyone in the blue book and make 
sure that everyone was told that there was some information that their voicemail messages 
may have been intercepted, that it may not be possible to prosecute for reasons that could 
be  explained,  but  that  they  ought  to  be  aware  of  that  fact  and  take  appropriate  security 
arrangements or, at least, be alert.325 DCS Surtees responded as follows:326

“I  accept  that.  In  terms  of  the  Blue  Book  and  in  terms  of  the  document  that  was 
produced  later,  which  was  a  document  produced  as  a  result  of  the  analysis  of  the 
electronic media, which I think came to us on 23 November 2006, in relation to both 
those documents, I accept that, the Metropolitan Police, could have approached all 
of those people and said, ‘Look what is on a piece of paper’, or, ‘Look what is on a 
document and look how it relates to you’. I accept that.”

6.11 

In my view, the police ought either to have informed those named in the blue book themselves, 
or have agreed with the phone companies that the latter would do so, and given them the 
means to do so by providing the list of names. The police ought then to have checked with 
the phone companies to ensure that all relevant individuals had been informed. Insofar as 
the police had concerns about their obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 when 
giving any names to the phone companies, this was a matter that could doubtless have been 
discussed and resolved: ultimately, the police could have avoided those concerns by informing 
those individuals themselves.

6.12  Unfortunately,  not  only  was  the  strategy  ill-conceived  but,  in  addition,  its  execution  was 
woefully  inadequate.  The  evidence  indicates  that  the  police  did  not  notify  all  the  victims 
for  whom  they  were  responsible  and  neither  does  it  appear  that  the  plan  was  ever,  in 
terms, communicated to the phone companies, despite a large part of the responsibility for 
informing victims being intended to fall on them. The police appear to have assumed that 
having been asked to identify any customers whose voicemail boxes had been called by the 
suspect numbers, the phone companies would naturally inform all those that they identified.

6.13  DCS Williams explained his thinking as follows:327

“When I wrote the strategy, it was based on what I believed was already happening 
in terms of our relationship with the service providers and as the case progressed to 
prosecution  that  ongoing  support,  discovery,  cooperation  and  joint  media  releases 

325 In his witness statement, at para 69, DCS Surtees had said that informing victims beyond those categorised as 
military, police, MPs and Royal Household, would have involved a huge and labour intensive commitment from SO13

329

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eserved  to  reinforce  my  belief.  I  believed  the  strategy  was  being  carried  out  as  an 
ongoing process and I had merely formalised the process at a moment in time with the 
official endorsement of my senior management.”

6.14  DCS Williams even appears to have contemplated that the phone companies would identify 

potential victims and notify them without giving the police their names. DCS Williams:328

“…  Albeit  all  of  the  companies  and  police  were  pragmatic  in  sharing  data  in  what 
potentially would bring us to an administrative halt if we went down the full process, 
neither  party  was  willing  to  share  long  lists  of  names  for  obvious  privacy/data 
protection reasons. Therefore the informing potential victim strategy embraced these 
issues by providing the optimum, discrete [sic] means of informing anyone who was 
identified as a potential victim supported by a single, well worn route for those who 
may wish to report the matter to police.”

6.15  DCS Surtees described it as his “understanding” that the telephone companies would tell 
those other than MPs, members of the military, members of the Royal Household and police 
that their phones had potentially been accessed.329 He said:330

“The Mobile phone companies had continued from the outset of the investigation to 
provide us with details of other customers who had their voicemails intercepted. At 
no time did I or indeed anybody else from the police team ask for this to stop, even 
post arrest and charge. The issue of the obligation to inform customers/victims to my 
knowledge was never explicitly documented anywhere either by the police or indeed 
the telephone companies. O2 were adamant that they would only inform us of possible 
victims after they had informed their customers and sought consent331. My view was 
that the telephone companies were responsible for their customers, as is the case in 
other areas of business such as in the banking industry.”
“Whilst I was not explicit as to what these companies should do around informing and 
keeping their customers up to date, I held the belief that this was, in fact, being done. 
To further reinforce this I ensured that the phone companies, especially those not as 
close to the investigation as the two mentioned herein, were briefed, and, through 
Jack Wraith, that any victims were directed back to this investigation. Like with O2, the 
emphasis was still very much on the phone companies to deal with their customers in 
a professional manner. The telephone companies knew which of their customers were 
subject to illegal access because it was they who told us in the first place. At no time 
were they ever restricted from informing those customers, although the extent of the 
information passed would be limited. Further, it was not for the police to dictate to 
private companies how to execute their internal procedures and how to deal with their 
own customers.”

6.16 

It does appear, therefore, that no attempt was even made to agree the strategy with the 
phone companies. In addition, there is no evidence of joint letters being agreed with the 
phone companies, despite this being the intention identified by the strategy. Furthermore, 
none of the phone companies have stated that they were asked, either before or after this

331 Therefore, to such extent as O2 provided names, he could at least conclude that those named individuals had been 
informed

330

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEstrategy was drafted, formally to notify any particular category of customer that they were 
the potential victim of voicemail interception.332 It is right that O2 did notify a number of their 
customers, but it appears that they did so of their own initiative and not because they were 
asked to by the police as part of the victim notification strategy. I therefore do not accept the 
argument of the MPS that the failure of the strategy was due to a misunderstanding between 
the MPS and the phone companies as to which categories of victims should be informed and 
by whom. The strategy failed because the MPS did not take the necessary steps to put it into 
effect.

6.17  As late as 2009, when briefing Mr Yates, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees did not even appear 
to have been aware that the strategy had failed. In a briefing note dated 12 July 2009, they 
stated:333

“It is not known in detail what each mobile phone company actually did, but anecdotally 
we know that upon learning of the flaws in their processes the phone companies took 
steps  prevent  future  breaches  and  albeit  these  measures  varied  from  company  to 
company they included contacting customers who they thought might have been a 
victim …”

6.18  When making its opening statement to the Inquiry, the MPS fully accepted that the victim 
notification strategy was not properly executed.334 The failure is now being remedied as part 
of Operation Weeting. The MPS states that it accepts that it should have done more to ensure 
the strategy was fully implemented, but argues that this needs to be seen in the context of 
the huge demand on what became SO15 resources in 2006-7, as a result of several major 
counter terrorism operations.

6.19  DCS Surtees has also added that the decision made by Mr Clarke not to expend any further 
resources on the operation affected the victim notification strategy. He said that after the 
decision  had  been  made  not  to  expand  the  investigation,  he  received  the  direction  that 
staff should only service the prosecution, and consequently, there were no staff to follow 
up with the phone companies what they were doing regarding victim notification.335 It does 
not, however, seem that anyone went back to Mr Clarke and reminded him of the resources 
needed to implement the strategy which, in outline, he had approved.

6.20 

In my judgment, these resource considerations simply do not explain why the basic steps 
required were not taken to ensure that the phone companies were aware of what the police 
expected them to do and agreed both to do it and to the terms of a joint letter. The decision 
made by Mr Clarke and the demand on resources may provide some explanation (but no 
excuse) for why these important steps in the process were apparently overlooked but the 
significance of the failure should not be minimised: it was a failure to take even basic steps to 
follow up the strategy and to ensure that it had worked as intended. Mr Clarke expressed his 
regret for the failure of the strategy in his witness statement:336

“I  have  since  learned  that  this  strategy  did  not  work  as  intended  and  as  former 
Assistant  Commissioner  John  Yates  has  publicly  acknowledged,  that  is  a  matter  of 
profound regret. It is also of course utterly regrettable that as a result of the decision

334 The MPS conceded the judicial review proceedings referred to at paras 11.7-11.17 below in which that issue 
occupied central stage. It acknowledged that it failed to take prompt, reasonable and proportionate steps to ensure 
that those identified as victims were made aware

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Enot to conduct a detailed analysis of all the material seized, victims of crime and their 
relatives, who I had no idea were the targets of the hackers, were not notified and did 
not receive the support that they deserved sooner.”

6.21  The failure of the victim notification strategy reduced the opportunity for other victims to 
make themselves known and created a perception that has caused significant damage to the 
reputation of the MPS. Once again, the important question is whether there is an evidential 
basis  for  finding  that  the  police  deliberately  failed  to  notify  people  because  they  did  not 
want the scale of the interceptions to be known publicly, which might itself have called into 
question both their strategy and their relationship with NI. The MPS contends forcefully that 
the failure of the strategy had nothing to do with inappropriately close relationships with 
(or fear of) members of the press, or any of the risks arising from such relationships as there 
were.

6.22  During his evidence Mr Clarke emphasised that his hope had been that the victim notification 
strategy would be comprehensive and would work. He said: “Sadly, it turned out not to be the 
case and to this day I don’t really understand why it didn’t work”.337

6.23  DCS Williams said:338

“This strategy … did not seek to hide the potential to be a ‘victim’ of this behaviour. Far 
from it, the whole aim was to secure maximum public awareness of the vulnerability 
through an effective and decisive criminal prosecution...”

6.24  DCS Williams was asked whether it was a fair observation that part of the reason for the failure 
of the strategy was the fear that notifying all potential victims would mean the matter would 
enter the public domain more explosively and force the police to carry out an investigation 
which they did not really want. DCS Williams said:339

“It’s not. I understand that’s what’s being said now, but I can assure you that was 
absolutely not the intention. I wanted to make this as public as possible, and the most 
obvious way of doing that is through a prosecution. If I hadn’t have wanted to have 
done it, I could have stopped this investigation much earlier, but that was absolutely 
not my intention. It was to secure a prosecution, to make this very public, and actually 
in the wider and long term, to make it absolutely clear what the risks were and how 
to prevent it.”

6.25 

It has been asserted that the failure to alert Lord Prescott, in particular, to the fact that he 
was a potential victim340 strongly supports the allegation that the police deliberately avoided 
notifying certain victims since, if Lord Prescott had been alerted, he is likely to have reacted 
to this revelation in such a way which would have made it very difficult for the police not to 
expand the investigation. It is important to note that, on 30 August 2006 DI Maberly emailed 
Vodafone asking if they could  tell him whether anyone has listened to the voicemail of a 
number of people, which included “Tracey Temple (Prescott)”.341 Clearly he was a suspected

340 This is despite the fact that Lord Prescott had been identified as such by the interviewing officers shortly after the 
arrests

332

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEvictim. Further, on 2 October 2006, DI Maberly emailed O2 identifying two persons of concern 
and asking O2 if they featured in the analysis O2 was preparing: the first name was “Joan 
Hammell (linked to prezza)”.342 DCS Williams was asked about the material relating to Lord 
Prescott. He said:343

“I  don’t  know  whether  I  knew  that  specific  bit  in  the  sense  of  it  sat  here  in  this 
interview.  What  I  was  briefed  about  was,  yes,  there  are  now  from  the  material  a 
number of other people in all walks of life, that include politicians, where it may be 
that they are potentially people who Mulcaire or others might want to target in terms 
of their voicemail.”

6.26 

It is extremely unfortunate that, apparently, DCS Williams was not made fully aware of the 
fact that the investigators suspected that Lord Prescott had been or, at the very least, was at 
risk of being, a victim, not least because of the significance of his position as Deputy Prime 
Minister. On the other hand, I consider it highly unlikely that this omission or the consequential 
failure to inform Lord Prescott was deliberate. The police had devised a strategy for bringing 
the matter to public attention, which included notification of specifically identified victims. It 
was not their overall intention that was at fault but, rather, the detail of the strategy and its 
implementation. It would be remarkable to embark on the exercise if their intention was to 
keep hidden what they had found. In the circumstances, it would not be safe or fair to conclude 
that the failure of the strategy was either a device to minimise publicity or avoid scrutiny or 
an attempt to ‘bury’ the scale of the problem. As DCS Surtees explained in evidence:344

“There  was  a  communication  strategy  which  was  devised  in  2006  and  it  was 
multifaceted.  It  dealt  with  the  information  that  was  put  out  for  offer.  Two  people 
had  been  arrested,  two  people  had  been  charged  with  these  offences.  There  was 
various media lines put out throughout the process: two men have pleaded guilty and 
then latterly two men have been sent to prison. So there were through the process 
of  August  into  January  2007  a  number  of  media  lines  put  out  and  a  lot  of  media 
coverage as a result of that.”

6.27  Further, the police informed the PCC345 and Mr Clarke is absolutely clear in his mind that he 
made the government aware of the investigation when Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire had 
been arrested. He said in his witness statement:346

“I recall discussing the case with Dr John Reid, the then Home Secretary, shortly after 
Goodman  and  Mulcaire  had  been  arrested.  This  was  in  the  margins  of  a  meeting 
about broader counter terrorism issues in the immediate aftermath of the Operation 
Overt arrests, and was of little significance other than to demonstrate that the Home 
Office had been informed of the arrests and the broad nature of the case that was 
alleged against Goodman and Mulcaire.”

333

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E6.28  Lord Reid confirmed this to the extent that he agreed it was quite possible that the subject of 
their arrests was mentioned informally by Mr Clarke though he personally does not recall a 
specific conversation.347 He added:348

“I do recall the issue being touched upon much later in one conversation with the Met 
Commissioner towards the end of my period in office … My recollection is of being 
told that work continued following the recent trial that had concluded in late January 
2007; that there was a considerable amount of material arising out of the trial and 
the investigations related to it; but that material did not equal evidence, and it would 
take some time to work through it with a view to gathering evidence.”

6.29  This  evidence  is  difficult  to  reconcile  with  the  fact  that,  towards  the  end  of  September 
2006, Mr Clarke decided that no further analysis of the material would take place. Lord Reid 
continued as follows:349

“So  that  was  certainly  my  impression  when  I  left  office,  that  having  carried  out 
the convictions on Goodman and Mulcaire, that now what was being done on the 
generality of it because there were other suspected victims of this.
“I think it was my final meeting. I can’t be sure of that, but I think the final meeting 
was around May with Ian.”

6.30  Lord Reid said that he was never made aware that were perhaps hundreds of victims and 
thousands of names or that Lord Prescott was one of names in which Mr Mulcaire could be 
seen to be interested, whether or not his phone messages or the phone messages of one his 
staff were actually the subject of interception.350

6.31  Not only do I conclude that a deliberate failure to inform victims was inconsistent with the 
evident desire of the police to bring the matter to public attention generally, but neither do I 
find it plausible that the officers concerned would devise a victim notification strategy which 
they never intended to execute. Further, for all the reasons that I have previously set out, I do 
not believe that the failure of the strategy was influenced in any way by or connected to any 
inappropriate relationship between the MPS and NI. By far the more plausible explanation 
for the failure of the notification strategy is that SO13, having been successful in its primary 
objective, simply took its eye off the ball in circumstances where it was extremely keen to 
return to what might be described as its core business, namely counter-terrorism.

6.32 

It has also been argued that when the police did notify victims, they favoured media contacts. 
For instance, Mrs Brooks was informed that she was a victim and, on 13 October 2006, DCS 
Surtees emailed the Mail on Sunday a list of five members of staff who had been found to 
be the victim of voicemail interception.351 It is said that this position is to be contrasted with 
that  of  Brian  Paddick,  Lord  Prescott  and  Simon  Hughes.  Brian  Paddick  was  a  Commander 
serving with the MPS at the material time; his name appeared in the project list created by 
the High Tech Crime Unit from information held on Mr Mulcaire’s computer. Indeed, the High 
Tech Crime Unit had specifically highlighted his name in the introduction to the document 
as someone about whom attempts had been made to obtain information. There were also 
references  in  Mr  Mulcaire’s  papers  which  included  the  name  of  Mr  Paddick,  his  address,

his mobile phone number and other phone numbers. It was only in 2010 that Mr Paddick 
was informed. Further, although Rt Hon Simon Hughes MP was an identified victim and the 
subject  of  one  of  the  charges  in  the  criminal  trial,  he  was  not  told  that  Mr  Mulcaire  had 
recorded in his notebook not only details about him but also his friends and family along with 
the names of three NoTW journalists other than Mr Goodman.352

I can well understand the reason for the concern that these witnesses had about the approach 
of the police which underlines the failure adequately to enunciate and implement a sensible 
and appropriate policy of notifying those who needed to know that their communications 
may not have been secure and their privacy had been violated or, at the very least, at risk. This 
might have been as a result of direct notification or by involving mobile phone companies but 
it had to be done and steps taken to ensure that it had been done. Having said that, the police 
did notify a number of those who were not related to the media (including, for instance, 
George Galloway who was told on 24 August 2006). In the circumstances, I consider that the 
undoubted failures of notification are not the result of cover-up or preferential treatment and 
favouritism towards the press but rather of poor strategy, and poor implementation of such 
strategy as existed with insufficient consideration to the importance that many if not most of 
the victims would attach to learning what had or might have happened to them.

The failure to warn NI or challenge the “one rogue reporter” 
assertion

6.34  The police were aware that there were very strong grounds for believing that journalists at 
NI,  other  than  Mr  Goodman,  had  been  involved  in  unlawful  voicemail  interception.  They 
had identified that the practice might be widespread. However justifiable their decision not 
to follow the evidential leads implicating other journalists might have been, that approach, 
brought with it an expectation that the police would take all other steps reasonably available 
to them to prevent the recurrence of the crime. In part that was achieved by mounting the 
high profile prosecution of Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman.

6.35  Given the extent of the material in the Mulcaire archive and the collation of that material in 
the blue book, one possible additional step would have been to alert senior management at 
NoTW and NI of their concern about the extent of the criminality so that the management 
could review their systems of corporate governance, possibly to institute their own internal 
investigation into the relationship between the NoTW and Mr Mulcaire which had permitted 
him  to  earn  so  much  money  and,  in  the  event  that  payments  could  not  be  justified  to 
take such steps as they thought appropriate to deal with the position. It could have been 
explained  to  NI  that  there  were  other  leads  in  the  material  which  they  had  seized  which 
could have revealed more widespread criminality but that were not being pursued because 
of significant competing priorities to deal with counter terrorism. This is not to suggest that 
the police should have undertaken any duty to monitor NI for which they had neither power 
nor resources.

6.36  Taking this step might have led NI and NoTW to be rather less forceful in their assertion of 
the line that Mr Goodman represented “one rogue reporter”. Furthermore, when the police 
became aware that NI’s public  approach was that Mr Goodman had been working alone, 
at the very least, the police should have been prepared to point to the observations of Mr 
Perry, the conclusion of Mr Justice Gross and the fact that their investigation (necessarily not 
taken as far as it could have been taken because of counter terrorism) should not be taken as

Hughes-MP.pdf 

335

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Esupporting that conclusion. I am not suggesting that they could make allegations about those 
whom  they  had  not  investigated;  distancing  the  police  from  these  conclusions,  however, 
would, at least, have provided some context.

6.37  DCS Surtees accepted that it would have been possible to go to NI and have a conversation 
although: “it may well have been viewed cynically”. He agreed that if the police had done so, 
then they could have pointed out, when reference was made to a single rogue reporter, that 
the police “put them right” because this did not do justice to the extent of the investigation.353 
This would not have taken a great deal of police resource.354

6.38  This step did not, however, cross the mind of DCS Williams. He said:355

“I didn’t think to specifically do that. I – if I think of your question and look back, I feel 
we made it abundantly clear what our understanding was and what our suspicions 
were in terms of the requests that we made to them. I’m sure they were well aware 
of what it was that we suspected, and given that ultimately a member of their senior 
management team resigned on the basis of what we’d found, I would have expected 
any senior management in an organisation to question why had that happened and 
to understand exactly what had gone on.”

6.39  He went on to say that:356

“Actually, I thought I’d already done that, had made it very clear, not just to them, but 
to any organisation that might be engaged in this, that might want to consider are 
we also doing this.
“That was the whole purpose. It was to show people: if you are doing this, whoever 
you are and wherever you are, actually it is clearly criminally wrong, and you’ll go 
to prison, and if you’re an organisation that knows that you seek information and 
you should be thinking to yourselves, ‘I wonder if we’ve got any vulnerabilities?’ – 
that’s what we do as a learning organisation in the police. I don’t necessarily expect 
someone to come and tell me that I should do that, and actually, I may be wrong, but 
I’m not aware in – either I’ve not done it and I’m not aware of my fellow investigators 
having actually gone and this in senior companies. I know in frauds, then, but that’s 
more in terms of vulnerabilities of a system as opposed to actually something being 
wrong in the organisation. That’s usually demonstrated through the prosecution of 
people.”

6.40  DCS  Williams  was  right  to  expect  the  senior  management  at  NI  to  conduct  an  internal 
investigation and take such preventative measures as were necessary, but it was not safe to 
assume that they would do so. Bearing in mind the ‘one rogue reporter’ defence, the reverse 
was more likely to be the case. On any showing, by strongly advising that course of action, it 
was open to the police to maximise the chances that the issues would be addressed.

6.41  The MPS argues that the omission to warn NI as to its future conduct was not a failing and that 
it did all that was reasonable (given the relevant context and state of knowledge at the time) 
to raise concerns with NI. The MPS submits that it was made “abundantly clear” to NI that

336

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEthe police suspected that voicemail interception was more widespread and that the message 
was delivered “very firmly” that they had a problem with employees engaged in “sustained 
periods of criminal activity”.357 The MPS submits that the attempted search of NI would have 
sent a very clear message to NI that the MPS was seeking any evidence of criminality and 
by implication a halt to any further criminal practice. Also, that the correspondence sent to 
Burton Copeland demonstrated the attempts made by the MPS to bring to the attention of NI 
both the nature and extent of the documentation required and by implication the practice of 
voicemail interception within NoTW. In my judgment, however, these submissions overstate 
the case: an aborted search that was not renewed and letters requesting documentation, 
both of which entailed no repercussions for NI sent no warning signal at all.

6.42  The MPS makes the further submission that it is evident from the recent arrests and various 
charges in Operation Weeting that there is at least material for suggesting that others at NI 
either knew or feared very much more extensive criminality. Without prejudicing the ongoing 
criminal investigation and prosecution, it is not right to go further although it is sufficient to 
point to Mr Myler’s comment about “bombs under the newsroom floor” as identifying his 
concern which was hardly consistent with the stated line. In any event, this argument misses 
the point: what was important was not what the NoTW knew or appreciated but that the 
police had strong grounds for believing that the offending was more extensive than the public 
line being deployed and that the fact that the investigation had not gone further should not 
be taken as police endorsement of an attempt to minimise what had been uncovered.

6.43  The MPS also relies on the prosecution itself, stating that this alone should have sent a very 
clear message to all media organisations, not just NI, that voicemail interception was illegal and 
would not be tolerated. I have no doubt that everyone understood the gravity of the position 
if it was detected. On the other hand, the deterrent effect of the prosecution would have 
been substantially reduced by the fact that NI had arguably thwarted a wider investigation 
by interfering with the searches in Wapping and by adopting the attitude reflected in the 
approach  of  Burton  Copeland  to  requests  for  information  and  documents.  The  deterrent 
effect would also be reduced by the fact that, despite the indications of wider criminality at 
NI, the investigation had been closed. In those circumstances, NI could well have considered 
itself “off the hook”. The matters relied upon by the MPS are simply not in the order of what, 
in my judgment, was required of them before they put Operation Caryatid behind them.

6.44  Finally, the MPS argues that any approach by the MPS to NI in an unofficial capacity to seek 
compliance could have been perceived by others as inappropriately ‘cosy’ and DCS Williams 
has said that he was operating under the general instruction from Mr Clarke not to engage 
with the media. The MPS would not, however, be acting in an unofficial capacity and it is 
not correct to suggest that a formal approach by senior officers, at a fully documented and 
minuted meeting, delivering the warning and advice outlined above, could be perceived as 
overly ‘cosy’ or otherwise inappropriate, or of a nature that Mr Clarke would prohibit.

7.	 The	reaction	of	the	News	of	the	World

Change of editors
The one significant change that occurred at the NoTW following the prosecution was the 
resignation of Andy Coulson and appointment of Colin Myler as editor. Mr Coulson said in

evidence that his resignation was his decision, reached without any prior discussion with Mr 
Murdoch or Mr Hinton:358

“I went to see Les Hinton and I was very clear that I was going to resign, and then I 
did so.”

Accepting this evidence, which has not been contested in any way, the replacement of Mr 
Coulson as editor was not a step taken by NI to effect a culture change, so much as a convenient 
opportunity.  On  his  departure,  Mr  Coulson  received  compensation  in  lieu  of  notice  and 
compensation for termination of employment.359 This appears to suggest a gesture of good 
will on the part of NI to Mr Coulson at the point of his personal decision to accept editorial 
responsibility for what had happened.

According  to  the  oral  evidence  of  Rupert  Murdoch,  Mr  Myler  was  appointed  to  “find  out 
what the hell was going on”.360 Mr Murdoch testified after Mr Myler and his version of events 
could not be put to the latter when he gave evidence in Module 1. Having been given the 
opportunity to comment on Mr Murdoch’s account, Mr Myler contends that he was given 
no  such  brief  either  in  these  somewhat  colourful  terms  or  otherwise,  and  that  he  simply 
understood his role as being to edit the paper.361 In response, Rupert Murdoch has clarified 
that it certainly was his understanding from Les Hinton that Mr Myler was appointed to “find 
out what the hell was going on”, and that it would not been possible for the latter to have 
moved the paper forward by improving its practices and governance, to avoid a repetition of 
the conduct which had led to the criminal convictions, without ascertaining what had gone 
wrong in the past.362 The upshot was that Mr Myler appears to have decided that his function 
should be forward-looking:363

“… the trauma of what had happened with the Goodman/Mulcaire trial left a very 
deep, as I say, trauma within the newspaper and the morale of the staff. So I think it 
was more important to improve the standards and the protocols and the systems that 
existed, rather than dwell on what was. I think it was more important to say, ‘From 
now on, this is how we’re going to work and this is what it is’.”

7.4  Mr Myler claimed, however, to be uneasy with the situation:

“It’s fair to say that I always had some discomfort and I always – the term I phrased 
was I felt that there could have been bombs under the newsroom floor and I didn’t 
know where they were and I didn’t know when they were going to go off. That was 
my own view. But trying to get the evidence or establishing the evidence that sadly 
the police already had was another matter.”364

7.5 

There were steps that Mr Myler could have taken in an attempt to locate and defuse ‘the

Mulcaire had been set and every story that Mulcaire had provided. Although in the light of 
the way in which the paper had dealt with the police investigation, it may have been difficult 
or embarrassing, he could have sought the assistance of the police not to encourage further 
investigation but to see whether there were any strands which they had considered which 
an internal investigation might pursue thereby demonstrating his determination to root out 
what had happened. Some of these steps might not have been practicable and the impact on 
morale had to be considered: but some must have been. In the event, he did little to assuage 
his own ‘discomfort’ except lay down rules for the future. As to the what had happened, he 
vigorously and forcefully followed a line which, to pursue the analogy of a bomb under the 
newsroom floor, simply ignored his privately held fear of an impending explosion.

The “one rogue reporter” claim

The PCC

7.6  Mr  Tim  Toulmin,  then  Director  of  the  Press  Complaints  Commission  (PCC)  said  that  the 
PCC had neither the legal powers nor the authority vested in it by the newspaper industry 
to  institute  an  inquiry  into  other  possible  instances  of  unlawful  voicemail  interception  at 
the NoTW or more generally in the press,365 but that it wanted to do something useful to 
complement the police inquiry so that light could be shone on what had gone wrong, and 
so that lessons could be learned to ensure that there was no repetition.366 Accordingly, on 
7 February 2007, Mr Toulmin wrote to Mr Myler asking a number of questions about the 
conduct of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire and asking him what the newspaper proposed to 
do to ensure that the conduct was not repeated. In his reply, Mr Myler urged the PCC to see 
the episode in perspective on the basis that it represented:367

“an exceptional and unhappy event in the 163 year history of the News of the World, 
involving one journalist”.

7.7  Mr Myler also emphasised the newspaper’s commitment to the Code of Practice, drawing 
attention, by way of example, to an episode where it had dismissed a reporter for breaching 
the provisions of the Code. He said that: 368

“Every single News of the World journalist is conversant with the Code and appreciates 
fully the necessity of total compliance”.

7.8  Mr Myler described Mr Goodman as a “rogue exception”. This is possibly the first use of what 

later became established as the “one rogue reporter” defence.369

7.9  Mr Myler also set out the changes that he was making to prevent repetition of the conduct 
concerned.  Those  changes  were:  ensuring  that  contributors  to  the  newspaper  clearly 
understood  their  responsibility  to  comply  with  the  Code  and  NI  policies  and  procedures; 
ensuring that all journalists focussed on the importance of the Code and legal compliance 
and the risk of dismissal for failure to comply; and instituting processes to ensure that large 
cash sums could not be paid without appropriate authority.370

365 The extent to which the PCC could have instituted enquiries is subject to analysis in the context of the PCC generally

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E7.10  The PCC concluded that: 371

“No evidence has emerged either from the legal proceedings or the Commission’s 
questions to Mr Myler and Mr Hinton of a conspiracy at the newspaper going beyond 
Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire to subvert the law and the PCC’s Code of Practice. 
There is no evidence to challenge Mr Myler’s assertion that: Goodman had deceived 
his employer in order to obtain cash to pay Mulcaire; that he had concealed the identity 
of the source of information on royal stories; and that no-one else at the News of the 
World knew that Messrs Goodman and Mulcaire were tapping phone messages for 
stories. However, internal controls at the newspaper were clearly inadequate for the 
purpose of identifying the deception.”

Parliament

7.11  On 6 March 2007, Les Hinton, Chairman of NI, appeared in front of the Culture Media and Sports 
Committee of the House of Commons (CMS Committee), which at that time was conducting 
an inquiry into self-regulation of the press. Voicemail interception was only briefly touched 
on at the hearing. Mr Hinton told the Committee that a, “full, rigorous internal inquiry” was 
being carried out and that he (Hinton) was absolutely convinced that Mr Goodman was the 
only person who knew what was going on.372 The Committee noted this assurance without 
comment but were highly critical of the financial processes in place in NoTW that they had 
been  told  allowed  Mr  Goodman  to  employ  Mr  Mulcaire  to  intercept  voicemail  messages 
without appropriate oversight or authority from senior executives.

7.12 

Dismissal of Clive Goodman and his appeal
It appears that Mr Goodman expected to continue his employment at the NoTW once he 
had served his sentence of imprisonment. In my judgment, that perception is, in itself, quite 
extraordinary. There can be few employees who would expect to return to their jobs after 
serving a sentence of imprisonment for a serious criminal offence, particularly an offence 
committed in the course of their employment and, even more so, where (as was contended) 
what he was doing was wholly unknown and had been managed and financed by deceit. 
The NI Disciplinary Policy and Procedure provided for immediate dismissal without notice, or 
payment in lieu of notice, for various forms of “gross misconduct” including: 373

“conviction for a criminal offence (including outside of work) which may bring News 
International into disrepute or otherwise impact on your suitability for employment 
with the Company”.

7.13 

In the circumstances Mr Goodman should properly have expected to be dismissed without 
any form of financial compensation. However, Mr Goodman felt he had been given assurances 
by  both  Tom  Crone  (the  lawyer  employed  by  NI  who  had  ultimate  legal  responsibility  for 
editorial legal matters at the NoTW) and Andy Coulson that he could return to work at the 
NoTW once he had served his sentence providing he did not implicate in criminal conduct any 
of the newspaper’s other staff.374 Whilst Mr Crone denied the allegation that there was any

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEsuggestion that Mr Goodman might be kept on as the price for his silence, Mr Crone did say 
that Mr Coulson had indicated that: 375

“…he hoped that whatever happened to Clive Goodman at the end of the criminal 
process, and if he was found guilty and served his sentence, he would be able to come 
back to the News of the World in some sort of role, having served his sentence. Not a 
reporting role that involved interaction with the public in any other way, but perhaps 
book filleting or book serialisation, possibly.”

7.14 

In the event, this view was not shared by Mr Hinton because on 5 February 2007 Mr Hinton 
wrote to Mr Goodman terminating his employment. The letter said: 376

“I recognise this episode followed many unblemished, and frequently distinguished, 
years of service to the News of the World. In view of this, and in recognition of the 
pressures on your family, it has been decided that upon your termination you will 
receive one year’s salary. In all the circumstances, we would of course be entitled 
to  make  no  payment  whatever…You  will  be  paid,  through  payroll,  on  6  February 
2007,  12  months’  base  salary,  subject  to  normal  deductions  of  tax  and  nation 
insurance.” 

7.15  The  terms  of  the  dismissal  were  considerably  more  generous  than  the  terms  of  his 
employment required, but Mr Goodman was not content. On 2 March 2007, Mr Goodman 
wrote to Daniel Cloke, then head of Human Resources at NI, appealing against his dismissal. 
His first two grounds of appeal were first, that the decision was perverse because his actions 
were carried out with the full knowledge and support of executives at the NoTW and second, 
that the decision was inconsistent because others, who were still working for the NoTW, were 
engaged in the same illegal procedures.377

7.16  On 14 March 2007, Mr Goodman submitted a lengthy list of documents which he wanted NI 
to provide for the purposes of his appeal. The list included emails passing between him and 
various named members of staff. On 9 May 2007 Jonathan Chapman, then Director of Legal 
Affairs  for  NI,  instructed  solicitors,  Harbottle  &  Lewis,  to  carry  out  a  review  of  the  emails 
identified by Mr Goodman. Mr Chapman sent formal instructions by email the following day 
to Lawrence Abramson, then managing partner at Harbottle & Lewis, which stated that:378

“Because of the bad publicity that could result in an allegation in an employment 
tribunal that we had covered up potentially damaging evidence found on our email 
trawl,  I  would  ask  that  you  …  carry  out  an  independent  review  of  the  emails  in 
question and report back to me with any findings of material that could possibly tend 
to support either of Mr Goodman’s contentions”.

7.17 

It is revealing that the concern was to identify material that would cause the company further 
embarrassment or damage their prospects in an Employment Tribunal rather than ascertain 
whether the allegations made by Mr Goodman were true.

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E7.18  On  25  May  2007  Mr  Abramson  emailed  Mr  Chapman  draft  wording  of  his  advice  for 

consideration by him before it was formalised.379 The email read:

“We have on your instructions searched the emails that you were able to let us have 
access to from the accounts of [redacted names] I can confirm that we did not find 
any evidence that proved that [redacted names] knew that Clive Goodman, Glenn 
Mulcaire or any other journalists as the News of the World were engaged in illegal 
activities prior to their arrest.”

7.19  Later that day Mr Chapman suggested an addition to the advice, namely:380

“Equally, having seen a copy of Clive Goodman’s notice of appeal of 2 March 2007, we 
did not find anything that we consider to be directly relevant to the grounds of appeal 
put forward by him.”

7.20  Mr Abramson declined to include this sentence because:

“I think the short answer is it wasn’t the exercise we’d been asked to conduct. We’d 
been asked to look for whether there was evidence in emails that supported specific 
allegations, and to have then signed off on an opinion that was much wider than the 
exercise we’d been conducting would have been wholly wrong and I couldn’t have 
done that.”

7.21  The final wording was the following:

“I can confirm that we did not find anything in those emails which appear to us to be 
reasonable evidence that Clive Goodman’s illegal activities were known about and 
supported …”

7.22 

It  is  important  to  note  the  limited  exercise  that  Harbottle  and  Lewis  had  been  asked  to 
carry out and the correspondingly limited comfort that NI could legitimately derive from it 
when considering the broad question of whether there was evidence that the conspiracy to 
intercept voicemail messages extended beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.

The limits of the internal investigation

7.23  Despite  the  assurance  given  by  Mr  Hinton  to  the  CMS  Committee  that  a  “full,  rigorous 
internal inquiry” was being carried out, there is no evidence that anyone at the NoTW made 
any  proper  effort  to  investigate  the  veracity  of  the  allegations  made  by  Mr  Goodman.381 
Apart from the review of the emails by Harbottle and Lewis, the internal investigation of the 
allegations made by Mr Goodman was limited to Mr Cloke and Mr Myler, speaking to the 
individuals named by Mr Goodman to ask whether there was any substance to them. Mr 
Myler said in his evidence that: 382

“in  the  absence  of  any  evidence  to  support  Mr  Goodman’s  allegations  they  were 
denied. Very strongly.”

379 p18, lines 2-10, ibid 
380 p23, lines 3-6, ibid
381 It is of course possible that Burton Copeland had been instructed to conduct such an investigation, but it has not 
been able to pursue whether this was the case because of NI’s refusal to waive legal professional privilege in respect of 
the instructions given to, or advice received from, Burton Copeland

342

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE7.24  Mr  Chapman  said  that  the  right  thing  to  do  was  to  investigate  whether  there  was  any 
foundation to the allegations.383 However, Mr Myler and Mr Cloke appear to have accepted 
at face value the denials of those individuals named by Mr Goodman. It does not appear that 
anyone at the title took seriously the possibility that the allegations were well-founded or, 
given the very substantial sums that he had been paid, even investigated precisely what Mr 
Mulcaire had been doing and for whom he had been working.

7.25  Mr Crone said during his evidence that he had believed from the outset that the claim that the 
unlawful voicemail interception had been the action of “one rogue reporter” was wrong.384 
Mr Crone had attended all the hearings at the Central Criminal Court, including the hearing 
at which Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were sentenced. He had “…formed a strong impression 
that what was said about others at News International commissioning Mulcaire’s accessing 
in relation to the non-royal victims was based upon more than circumstantial evidence.”385 
Mr Crone agreed during his evidence that one reason for forming that view was that counts 
16 to 20 did not relate to Royal issues and would therefore be outside Mr Goodman’s area of 
interest.386 When asked whether he had shared his view with others at NI that the “one rogue 
reporter” claim was wrong he replied: 387

“I had discussions which were privileged, yes. But I don’t think any of them involved 
me saying there’s clear and hard evidence, to be perfectly honest.”

7.26  Mr  Crone  explained  that  he  took  no  other  action  because  the  police  showed  no  signs  of 
continuing  the  investigation  or  making  more  arrests  and  “the  company’s  primary  thought 
was to draw a line under it”.388 Certainly it appears that whatever privileged discussions Mr 
Crone might have had he did nothing to change the view that Mr Myler had formed, namely 
that  there  was  no  evidence  to  justify  an  investigation  into  possible  unlawful  or  unethical 
behaviour in the newsroom at the News of the World. Mr Myler explained that apart from 
the investigations into the allegations made by Mr Goodman during his appeal against his 
dismissal, he relied heavily on the fact that the police investigation had gone no further than 
the charges against Mr Goodman and had not resulted in any suggestion by the police to the 
News of the World that there was a wider problem.389

7.27 

The Goodman and Mulcaire settlements
In July 2007 NI settled a claim for unfair dismissal brought by Mr Goodman, making a payment 
of a further £140,000 in addition to a £90,000 notice payment that had been made in February 
2007 when Mr Goodman was dismissed.390 The focus in dealing with Mr Goodman’s claims 
was, according to Mr Chapman, to manage the risk of further reputational damage to the 
company. The settlement agreement contained a confidentiality clause.391

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E7.28  The circumstances of Mr Goodman’s dismissal create an impression that his criminal conduct 
was viewed not as an outrageous breach of the law, the Code and the company’s policies, but 
as something akin to a regrettable oversight in an old and trusted employee. The response 
to the conviction and Mr Goodman’s allegations suggest that the possible widespread use of 
illegal methods of obtaining information was regarded, at the highest, as a reputational risk if 
exposed. There is no sign that the News of the World regarded the fact that criminal conduct 
may have flourished as a significant risk either from a corporate governance or operational 
perspective. The potential underlying truth of the allegations was apparently regarded as a 
second order issue.

7.29  Running  parallel  with  the  dispute  between  NI  and  Mr  Goodman  was  the  similar  dispute 
between NI and Mr Mulcaire, who was not an employee but who sought similar financial 
recompense. In April 2007 Mr Mulcaire claimed that his contract with NI gave him employment 
rights  and  that  NI  had  not  followed  the  correct  statutory  procedures  when  it  terminated 
the contract in January 2007. The view was taken that there was a significant risk that an 
employment tribunal would find that Mr Mulcaire did have employment rights. Mr Chapman 
explained his analysis:

“When I analysed the position, based on the usual parameters, mutuality of obligation, 
control,  right  of  substitution,  it  looked  very  much  to  me  like  Mr  Mulcaire  was  an 
employee, and I understand that subsequently Farrers took that view as well.”392

Mr  Mulcaire  was  paid  approximately  £80,000.393  Mr  Chapman  agreed  that  the  reasoning 
process that led to alighting upon a settlement figure for Mr Mulcaire was more or less the 
same as that which applied to Mr Goodman, namely the need to limit reputational harm.394

7.30  The approach of the company to severance payments or payments in lieu to Mr Goodman 
and  Mr  Mulcaire  does  not  appear  to  convey  corporate  concern  at  their  criminality;  the 
payment to Mr Coulson395 may be considered slightly differently but is starkly in contrast to 
its approach to other employees such as Mr Driscoll.396

The Gordon Taylor litigation

7.31  The next significant event was the civil claim for damages brought by Gordon Taylor in the 
spring of 2008. As Mr Crone, Mr Chapman and Mr Myler stated repeatedly in evidence, the 
desire of the News of the World was to draw a line under the matter. As a result, the claim 
cannot have been well-received, not just because of the obvious financial implications, but 
also because of the potential reputational harm that would result even from only a repeat 
exposure of the facts of the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.

7.32  The claim was brought against NGN and Mr Mulcaire for breach of confidence, misuse of 
private  information  and  breach  of  privacy.  When  Mr  Taylor  served  his  claim  he  provided 
no documentary evidence to support it and NGN filed a defence denying any involvement. 
However, Mr Taylor then applied for, and obtained, an order requiring the police to release 
the prosecution papers and evidence to his solicitors. Among those papers was the contract 
between Mr Mulcaire and the News of the World to pay Mr Mulcaire £7,000 for information

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEabout an affair being conducted by Mr Taylor and the “for Neville” email, which enclosed 
transcripts of voicemail messages from Mr Taylor’s mobile phone.397 Mr Crone recorded in a 
briefing note on 24 May 2008 that this material was “fatal to our case”.398 “Recognising the 
inevitable”, Mr Crone instructed NGN’s solicitors, Farrer & Co, to make an offer to Mr Taylor 
of £150,000 plus costs.

7.33 

In the light of the awards that had been made for breach of confidence and invasion of privacy, 
this was a very substantial offer but Mark Lewis, of the solicitors instructed to pursue the 
claim, replied that Mr Taylor was not interested in settling and wanted to take the matter to 
trial. Mr Crone sought advice from Michael Silverleaf QC about how NGN should proceed.399 
The advice from Mr Silverleaf, dated 3 June 2008, was very clear and echoed what Mr Crone 
had already concluded. Mr Silverleaf concluded that: 400

“NGN’s  prospects  of  avoiding  liability  for  the  claims  of  breach  of  confidence  and 
invasion of privacy…… are slim to the extent of being non-existent.”

7.34  He found it difficult to give clear advice on the level of damages that might be expected but 
put it within a range of £25,000-£250,000 or even slightly more.401 In addition, Mr Silverleaf 
reflected on what the papers told him about the quality of the defence filed by the News of 
the World, stating: 402

“In the light of these facts, there is a powerful case that there is or was a culture of 
illegal information access used at NGN in order to produce stories for publication.”

7.35  Also on 3 June 2008 Julian Pike, a partner at Farrer & Co, told Mr Taylor’s solicitors that NGN 
was about to make an offer of £350,000. He said that NGN were happy that this would not be 
beaten by the amount that might be awarded at trial, but that they were prepared to pay the 
higher amount in order to resolve the matter that week and on the basis that the deal would 
be confidential.403 Mr Pike then spoke to Mr Taylor’s solicitor, Mr Lewis, on 6 June 2008. Mr 
Lewis  indicated  that  Mr  Taylor  would  want  at  least  £1  million  plus  costs  “not  to  open  his 
mouth”. The report of the conversation made by Mr Pike shows a desire on the part of Mr 
Taylor to pursue the claim in order to demonstrate that voicemail interception was “rife in the 
organisation”.404 Ultimately NGN settled with Mr Taylor for £700,000, of which £425,000 was 
attributed to damages and the balance to costs.405

Who knew what?
It is not clear whether Mr Crone, who attended the Central Criminal Court, made any senior 
executives aware of the key matters that indicated that the practice of unlawful voicemail

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Einterception was not confined to Mr Goodman. Those matters were: the content of counts 
16 to 20 on the indictment; the fact that they were brought against Mr Mulcaire but not Mr 
Goodman; the fact that they related to victims who were of no apparent interest to a royal 
correspondent and the sentencing remarks of Gross J. Mr Chapman said that he had obtained 
a copy of the sentencing remarks at the request of Daniel Cloke, and on behalf of Mr Crone, 
but that he did not read them himself.406 Mr Myler claimed to be unaware of the sentencing 
remarks.407 There is no reason to doubt what Mr Myler says but, given the background and 
his own perception of the newsroom, this lack of interest is also remarkable.

7.37 

In short, Mr Crone and Mr Chapman were both clearly aware of the allegations made by Mr 
Goodman in his appeal against dismissal, but there is no evidence that they were known 
more widely. Mr Myler was also aware of them to the extent that they were demonstrated 
by the documents disclosed by the police for the purposes of the claim brought by Mr Taylor 
(these documents were also seen by Mr Crone).

7.38  The  extent  of  James  Murdoch’s  knowledge  of  the  allegations  is  not  clear.  There  was  a 
discussion  between  Mr  Myler  and  James  Murdoch  of  which  neither  participant  claims  to 
have a substantial recollection. However, Mr Pike made a note of a subsequent telephone 
conversation that he had with Mr Myler on 27 May 2008,408 during which Mr Myler relayed to 
Mr Pike what he explained were the relevant points of his conversation with James Murdoch. 
The note is not straightforward to interpret. It makes reference to the fact that Mr Goodman 
“sprayed around allegations”409 but it is not clear whether that was a reference to what had 
been discussed with James Murdoch or to the beginning of a subsequent discussion between 
Mr Myler and Mr Pike. James Murdoch contended that the note of his conversation with 
Mr  Myler  did  not  go  beyond  recording  his  view  that  they  should  wait  for  the  opinion  of 
leading Counsel, which had already been sought.410 James Murdoch said in evidence that Mr 
Myler had not taken the opportunity to alert him to the fact that there were allegations that 
voicemail interception at the News of the World went wider than Mr Goodman.411

7.39  There is also a dispute about how high within the organisation the advice from Mr Silverleaf 
was seen. There is no doubt that Mr Crone412 read it. Mr Myler said in evidence that he was 
told the gist of it but did not see the actual advice and was not told that Mr Silverleaf’s opinion 
was that there was a “powerful case that there is or was a culture of illegal information access 
used  at  NGN  in  order  to  produce  stories  for  publication.”413  James  Murdoch  said  that  the 
opinion of Mr Silverleaf was mentioned to him but not shown to him (which he explains is 
not unusual as the Chief Executive), and that he was not told that there was new evidence 
that  NGN’s  involvement  in  voicemail  interception  went  beyond  Mr  Goodman.414  What  is

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEclear is that, even following the unequivocal opinion of Mr Silverleaf, no action was taken to 
investigate whether there was a culture of obtaining information by unlawful means. Instead, 
the  full  focus  of  the  management  team  was  on  handling  the  litigation  and  the  potential 
reputational repercussions.

7.40  On 7 June 2008 Mr Myler forwarded an email chain to James Murdoch which made clear that 
Mr Taylor was asserting that unlawful information gathering techniques were “rife within the 
organisation”.415 The message from Mr Myler read:

“James,  update  on  the  Gordon  Taylor  Professional  Football  Association  case. 
Unfortunately it’s as bad as we feared. The note from Julian Pike of Farrers is extremely 
telling regarding Taylor’s vindictiveness but again that speaks for itself. It would be 
helpful if Tom Crone and I could have five minutes with you on Tuesday.”

7.41 

James Murdoch explained in evidence that he did not read all the email chain, and did not 
read the specific allegation made by Mr Taylor because he received the email on a Saturday 
when he was with his family. He said that since he was due to meet Mr Myler to discuss the 
issue on the following Tuesday he did not feel he needed to read beyond the request for a 
meeting.416 James Murdoch replied to the email within two minutes of receiving it. The speed 
and content of his reply appear to support his claim not to have focused on the key allegation.

7.42  On 10 June 2008, Mr Myler, Mr Crone and  James Murdoch  met to discuss  the civil  claim 
brought by Mr Taylor. Mr Crone said in evidence that he probably took with him copies of Mr 
Silverleaf’s opinion, the pleadings from the case, spare copies of the front page of the “for 
Neville” email and his earlier briefing note.417 Crone said that he could not recall whether 
any of these documents were handed to James Murdoch but that he was “pretty sure” that 
he held up the front page of the “for Neville” email.418 Mr Crone was very clear that the “for 
Neville” email was discussed, and that James Murdoch was told that it was direct and hard 
evidence of involvement in voicemail interception beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire.419 
Mr Myler said that he did not have any useful recollection of what specifically was discussed 
at the meeting or what documents were discussed or shared.

7.43 

7.44 

James Murdoch said in evidence that he was told at the meeting that there was evidence 
that linked the interception of Mr Taylor’s voicemail messages to the NoTW and that the case 
would certainly be lost and should be settled. His recollection was that Mr Crone and Mr 
Myler told him that counsel’s advice on the level of settlement was that: “the number could 
be upwards of … £425,000, so they said half a million to a million pounds with costs in it.”

James Murdoch said that it was established at the meeting that it was better to settle at an 
amount that would avoid litigating a case that would be lost than “drag up all these things, 
a painful episode in the past and what not”.420 He also stated that the discussion about the 
“for Neville” email was limited to the fact that it linked the NoTW to the interception of Mr 
Taylor’s voicemail messages and that there was no discussion about the fact that it suggested 
the involvement of other NoTW journalists. He said that he was not shown a copy of the

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eemail421 or the opinion of Mr Silverleaf, nor told that the opinion of Mr Silverleaf was that 
there was evidence that the practice of voicemail interception was used by journalists other 
than Mr Goodman.422

7.45  Given the significance of the issue, it is necessary also to deal with the extent to which Rupert 
Murdoch had knowledge of the relevant facts. Rupert Murdoch said in evidence that he knew 
nothing of the settlement of the claim brought by Mr Taylor when it happened in 2008. He 
said that he first learned of it in 2009 and was very surprised by the size of the settlement.423 
He recalled discussing with James Murdoch why the settlement was so high, but denied that 
there was any discussion about the fact that Mr Taylor had evidence of further illegality at 
NoTW or that NGN had had to settle at that level to buy the silence of Mr Taylor. He said that 
James Murdoch’s explanation for the value of the settlement was that, though high, it was 
less than the anticipated cost of a full trial.424

7.46  Rupert Murdoch claimed that senior management at NI:425

“…were,  all  misinformed  and  shielded  from  anything  that  was  going  on  there...
there’s no question in my mind that maybe even the editor, but certainly beyond that 
someone took charge of a cover-up which we were victim to”.

7.47  He went on to say that the culture of cover-up emanated from:

“one or two very strong characters ………or the person I’m thinking of…..was a clever 
lawyer and forbade people to go and report to Mrs Brooks or to James.”

7.48  Both Mr Myler and Mr Crone strongly denied that there was a culture of cover up at the 
NoTW. Mr Crone accepted that everyone hoped that “it would all go away” if it could be 
kept quiet,426 but contended that the thinking was not to cover up criminality but to avoid 
reputational damage through bad publicity.427 There is undoubtedly a fine line between the 
two. Mr Myler, similarly, said: 428

“I don’t believe it was a cover-up….and I don’t believe it’s wrong or unreasonable 
of any business to try to protect the reputation of itself, particularly after what had 
happened in the course of 2006 and 2007.”

7.49  Whatever the truth of what was discussed on 10 June 2008, the evidence outlined above 
points to a serious failure of governance within the NoTW, NI and News Corporation. There 
was  a  failure  on  the  part  of  the  management  at  the  NoTW  to  take  appropriate  steps  to 
investigate whether there was evidence of wrongdoing within the organisation. Although I 
endorse the right of any business to seek to protect its reputation, it surely must first take 
every step to get to the bottom of what had happened. To argue that the decision by the 
police to conclude their criminal investigations precluded the requirement for a proportionate

348

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEbut robust internal investigation is, in the circumstances, of real concern; and the attitude at 
NoTW to the police investigation equally meant that reliance could not be put on their having 
done so. In any event, if the explanation of James and Rupert Murdoch is correct, far from 
simply limiting external damage to reputation, one or more parts of the management at the 
NoTW was engaged in a determined cover-up to keep relevant information about potential 
criminal activity within the organisation from senior management within NI.

7.50  Having made that point, however, I must make it clear that if James Murdoch was unaware 
of the allegations, his lack of knowledge is, at least in part, only as a result of chance, rather 
than as the consequence of a sustained campaign by Mr Myler or Mr Crone (if there was one) 
deliberately to keep him in the dark. The fact is that had he read, in detail, the entirety of the 
email that he received on 7 June 2008, there was sufficient to put him onto a line of enquiry 
which could have led to an investigation of the entire issue. It also depends on precisely what 
he was told on 10 June 2008.

7.51 

It is sufficient to say that if James Murdoch had been the victim of a cover-up, or an attempt 
to minimise the gravity of the position, then the accountability and governance systems at 
NI  would  have  to  be  considered  to  have  broken  down  in  an  extremely  serious  respect.  If  
James Murdoch was not the victim of an internal cover up then the same criticism can be 
made of him as of Mr Myler or Mr Crone in respect of the failure to take appropriate action 
to deal with allegations of widespread criminality within the organisation.

7.52  A  similar  analysis  stands  in  respect  of  News  Corporation.  Although  there  is  no  evidence 
from which I could safely infer that Rupert Murdoch was aware of a wider problem, it does 
not appear that he followed up (or arranged for his son to follow up) on the brief that he 
believed had been given to Mr Myler to “find out what the hell was going on”, leaving the 
matter solely in the hands of Mr Hinton. If News Corporation management, and in particular 
Rupert Murdoch, were aware of the allegations, it is obvious that action should have been 
taken to investigate them. If News Corporation were not aware of the allegations which, as  
Rupert Murdoch has said, have cost the corporation many hundreds of millions of pounds, 
then there would appear to have been a significant failure in corporate governance and in 
particular in the effective identification and management of risks affecting NI and, thus, the 
corporation.

7.53 

I have given careful consideration as to whether I should go further, and conclude that Mr 
Crone’s version of events as to what occurred on 10 June 2008 should be preferred to that of 
James Murdoch. There are aspects of the account of Mr Murdoch that cause me some concern: 
in particular, it is surprising if the gist of Mr Silverleaf’s opinion was not communicated to him 
in circumstances where the potential reputational damage to the company, of which he was 
CEO, was likely to be great if an early settlement of the claim brought by Mr Taylor were not 
achieved.

7.54  Furthermore,  Mr  Myler  and  Mr  Crone  had  no  reason  or  motive  to  conceal  relevant  facts 
from the senior man, as borne out by the former sending James Murdoch the chain of emails 
containing the ‘bad news’ on the afternoon of Saturday 7 June 2008. Not merely does this 
throw light on Mr Myler’s state of mind on that date, it provides some indication as to what 
the agenda might have been for the meeting three days later. On the other hand, I also have 
serious concerns about the evidence of Mr Crone and Mr Myler about this meeting: given 
the significance of the issue, it is surprising that there was not a full blown risk analysis with 
options  for  James  Murdoch  to  consider.  After  all,  this  litigation  represented  the  first  of  a 
number of potential actions and there was, at the very least, a real risk that the problems were 

349

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E7.55 

7.56 

likely to get worse as the other known victims (as represented by the criminal investigation if 
none other) could and doubtless would also pursue claims.

It is here that I must return to the Terms of Reference and to recognise that the detail of 
who knew what is properly part of Part 2 of this Inquiry not least because of the ongoing 
criminal investigation. Furthermore, the nature of the process of this part of the Inquiry has 
meant that, in relation to these extremely fact sensitive meetings, there has been insufficient 
opportunity for detailed cross examination of precisely what was said by whom to whom. In 
the circumstances, I do not seek to reach any conclusion about precisely what transpired at 
this meeting. For present purposes, it is sufficient to repeat that whoever’s account is correct 
as to what happened on 10 June 2008, there was no subsequent analysis of the consequences 
in relation to oversight and internal governance.

In truth, at no stage, did anybody drill down into the facts to answer the myriad of questions 
that could have been asked and which could be encompassed by the all embracing question 
“what the hell was going on”? These questions included what Mr Mulcaire had been doing 
for such rewards and for whom?; what oversight had been exercised in relation to the use of 
his services?; why had Mr Goodman felt it justifiable to involve himself in phone hacking?; 
why had he argued that he should be able to return to employment and why was he being (or 
why had been) paid off. On any showing, these questions were there to be asked and simple 
denials should not have been considered sufficient. This suggests a cover up by somebody 
and at more than one level. Although this conclusion might be parsimonious, it is more than 
sufficient to throw clear light on the culture, practices and ethics existing and operating at 
the News of the World at the material time. The way in which further litigation was managed 
(including the action brought by Max Clifford) only serves to underline the same issue both 
justifying and reinforcing the same conclusion.

July	2009:	The	Guardian

8.1 

Introduction
Although  the  NoTW  was  having  to  cope  with  the  consequences  of  Operation  Caryatid 
both in relation to Clive Goodman, Glenn Mulcaire, Andy Coulson and all those who then 
wished  to  pursue  claims  for  damages,  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  prosecution 
and notwithstanding what journalists knew, believed or had gossiped about in relation to 
voicemail interception, until the Guardian article, there is no evidence that the wider issue 
(or the police investigation) was considered in any detail by the press. When the Guardian 
(and, subsequently, the New York Times) did publish articles, both the Police and the PCC 
reacted. They did so, however, in ways that have raised more questions than they answered 
and, in the context of this Part of the Inquiry, require detailed consideration.

8.2  More  specifically,  this  Inquiry  must  address  the  public  concern  about  the  decisions  taken 
by the MPS in 2009 and 2010 to the effect that there was nothing in what was reported in 
the press to justify further examination despite the claim that the MPS itself held evidence 
that implicated other journalists and which would merit further investigation. In particular, it 
boils down to the question whether any relationship between the MPS and NI, or between 
officers within the MPS and senior management in NI influenced the decisions which were 
then made.

350

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE8.3 

8.4 

To address that issue, the focus of this section is upon the reasons why, until January 2011, the 
MPS, and the then Assistant Commissioner, John Yates, in particular, asserted and maintained 
the position that there was no evidence of further criminality and that absent “new evidence”, 
there  was  no  reason  to  re-open  the  2006  investigation,  despite  the  facts,  first,  that  the 
detectives involved in Operation Caryatid knew that there was evidence implicating other 
journalists, but which had not been taken further in 2006 because of resource constraints 
and, second, that the police held vast quantities of material that had not been fully analysed 
in 2006.

The allegations made by the Guardian
On  8  and  9  July  2009  the  Guardian  published  an  article429  which  exposed  that  NGN  had 
paid out more than £1 million to settle claims for the reason that the claims threatened to 
reveal evidence of its journalists’ repeated involvement in the use of criminal methods to 
obtain stories. Those criminal methods were alleged to include using private investigators to 
intercept the mobile phone voicemail messages of numerous public figures, including cabinet 
ministers, MPs, actors and sportspeople. The article referred specifically to the claim brought 
by Gordon Taylor and stated:

“Today, the Guardian reveals details of the suppressed evidence which may open the 
door to hundreds more legal actions by victims of News Group, the Murdoch company 
that publishes the News of the World and the Sun, as well as provoking police inquiries 
into reporters who were involved and the senior executives responsible for them.”

8.5 

The  article  claimed  that  the  evidence  posed  difficult  questions  for  Andy  Coulson,  Rupert 
Murdoch executives and, in addition:

(a) 
(b) 

(c) 

the MPS “who did not alert all those whose phones were targeted”;
the CPS, “which did not pursue all possible charges against News Group personnel”; 
and
the PCC, “which claimed to have conducted an investigation but failed to uncover any 
evidence of illegal activity”.

8.6 

The article referred to the assertion of NI, following the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr 
Mulcaire, that it knew of no other journalist who was involved in voicemail interception and 
that Mr Goodman had been acting without its knowledge. The article then went on:

“However, one senior  source at the Met.  police told the Guardian  that  during  the 
Goodman  inquiry,  officers  had  found  evidence  of  News  Group  staff  using  private 
investigators who hacked into “thousands” of mobile phones. Another source with 
direct  knowledge  of  the  police  findings  put  the  figure  at  “two  or  three  thousand” 
mobiles. They suggest that MPs from all three parties and cabinet ministers, including 
former deputy prime minister John Prescott and former culture secretary Tessa Jowell, 
were among the targets …”

8.7 

The article referred to the fact that in the claim brought by Mr Taylor, the court had ordered 
the MPS to disclose evidence obtained during its investigation into Mr Goodman and then 
reported as follows:

351

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“The Scotland Yard files included paperwork which revealed that, contrary to News 
Group’s initial denial, Mulcaire had provided a recording of the messages on Taylor’s 
phone to a News of the World journalist who had transcribed them and emailed them 
to a senior reporter; and that a News of the World executive had offered Mulcaire 
a  substantial  bonus  payment  for  a  story  specifically  related  to  the  intercepted 
messages.”

8.8 

The article also reported that, faced with this evidence, NI began offering huge sums of money 
to Mr Taylor to settle the case and secure a confidentiality clause. It continued:

“The Scotland Yard paperwork also provided evidence that the News of the World 
had been involved with Glenn Mulcaire in his hacking the mobile phones of at least 
two other figures from the world of football. They, too, filed complaints, which were 
settled earlier this year when News International paid a total of more than £300,000 
in damages and costs on condition that they, too, signed gagging clauses.
“The  Guardian’s  understanding  is  that  the  paperwork  disclosed  by  Scotland  Yard 
to  Taylor  is  only  a  fraction  of  the  total  material  they  gathered  on  News  Group’s 
involvement with Glenn Mulcaire.”

8.9 

The Guardian had made a clear allegation that evidence implicating journalists other than Mr 
Goodman had already been obtained by the police during the original investigation. It was 
not the case that the Guardian was alleging that it had uncovered evidence that the police 
had not been able to obtain themselves.

8.10  The  article  prompted  a  number  of  responses  which  bear  detailed  examination  although 
the response from NI itself can be dealt with shortly. The evidence of James Murdoch was 
that the article was drawn to his attention and that he asked the management at the NoTW 
whether the allegation, that Mr Taylor had been paid, in effect, “hush money”, was true. He 
said that he was assured:430

“That it wasn’t true, that there was no other evidence, that there – you know, this 
is a – you know, this has been investigated to death and this is, you know, a smear.”

8.11  He  made  no  effort  to  probe  further  and  accordingly  there  was  no  investigation  of  the 

allegations.

The police response

8.12  On  the  morning  of  9  July  2009,  which  was  the  day  after  the  Guardian  article  appeared 
online but when it featured in the print edition of the newspaper, the Metropolitan Police 
Commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, was being driven to an ACPO conference. It was quite 
frequently the case that he would hear something on the radio or read something in the 
newspaper  and  ask  the  matter  to  be  looked  into  and  he  heard  a  discussion  on  the  radio 
about the allegations made in the article. Sir Paul understood the allegation to be that the 
MPS had not “gone the whole distance” in the investigation. He took it to be “just yet another 
headline” which he expected the Assistant Commissioner to pick up and deal with.431 In this

352

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEcase, by reason of his responsibility, John Yates was the natural choice: by then, Mr Yates had 
succeeded Andy Hayman as the Assistant Commissioner in charge of Specialist Operations.432

8.13  Sir Paul telephoned Mr Yates. Sir Paul and Mr Yates had the common understanding that Mr 
Yates was not expected to conduct a “review” of Operation Caryatid but to “establish the 
facts” surrounding the investigation.433 As Mr Yates stressed:434

“The request was to ‘establish the facts’. There has been some misunderstanding and 
debate about the term ‘review’ – a review in police terms is a comprehensive piece of 
work which involves a substantial number of people reviewing an entire investigation 
or particular aspects of one … Reviews are resource intensive and there has to be a 
compelling reason for a decision to devote staff and officers to undertake one. New 
evidence or new information could obviously be a compelling reason, although it is 
likely  that  a  scoping  exercise  would  be  carried  out  first  to  decide  whether  such  a 
decision was merited. The article of 9 July 2009 provided no such new evidence or 
new information that merited a full review.”

8.14  An issue that arises immediately is whether it was appropriate for Mr Yates to conduct the 
exercise  at  all  given  the  nature  of  his  relationship  with  Neil  Wallis.435  This  was  significant 
because, according to the Guardian, there appeared to be a conspiracy involving reporters at 
the NoTW which possibly encompassed senior executives responsible for reporters. Needless 
to say Mr Wallis, as deputy editor of the NoTW, was someone who on the face of things fell 
within this latter category and there was therefore a risk that far from assuaging concern, 
should the nature of his friendship become public knowledge, Mr Yates would exacerbate it.

8.15  Police action should always be capable of withstanding the test of public scrutiny and both 
the  independence  of  decision-making  and  the  appearance  of  the  same  are  vital  to  this. 
Whilst there is no evidence to cause me to suspect that Mr Yates was, in fact, influenced 
in his decision-making by his friendship with Mr Wallis, I have no doubt that he should not 
have accepted the task nor maintained responsibility for considering subsequent allegations 
made in the press; particularly (as was the event), if he was to dismiss the concern, he risked 
creating a perception that the decision-making of the MPS was not independent or impartial, 
but influenced by his friendship.

8.16 

In response to the suggestion that he should not have undertaken the fact-finding exercise in 
the light of his relationship with Mr Wallis, Mr Yates said:436

“…  from  2005,  2006  onwards,  whenever  Caryatid  started,  there  was  never  any 
question of Mr Wallis being involved. He hadn’t resigned, he continued to work at the 
newspaper. There was no evidence in July 2009 …
“... So as far as we were aware, you had Mr Goodman, as a cog in a large organisation, 
arrested for wrongdoing and sent to prison. That, as far as I was aware at the time 
and others were aware, no other evidence to suggest others’ involvement, does that

think it does.”

8.17  Leaving  aside  for  the  time  being  the  misconception  that  there  was  “no  other  evidence  to 
suggest others’ involvement”, in this response, Mr Yates missed the point. It was no answer to 
state that there was no evidence to suggest that Mr Wallis was involved in unlawful voicemail 
interception  because  the  Guardian  was  claiming  precisely  that  senior  executives  could  be 
involved and that there was evidence that they were. On analysis, this response betrays a 
closed mind-set because it suggests that Mr Yates had already dismissed the very question 
he was being asked to consider, even if on a limited basis: namely whether the police held 
evidence of a conspiracy to intercept communications that went beyond Mr Goodman and 
Mr Mulcaire and which they should now be considering. Further, in this answer Mr Yates did 
not grapple with the fact that his friendship with Mr Wallis might create a perception that he 
would be influenced in his decision-making. When challenged about the perception created 
he said: 437

“No, I take – of course I take your point, but I think the benefit of hindsight once again 
comes into play because in July 2009 there was nothing to suggest that Wallis was 
involved in any way whatsoever, and what’s happened in the last few years, and of 
course nothing has been proven yet, but in July 2009 there was just – there was no 
indication at all, and I did this very dispassionately, and I take your point about the 
perception, but it didn’t appear to me to be a problem then and it didn’t appear to 
others to be a problem then. It is clearly a problem now.”

8.18  Mr Yates continued:438

“I completely take that as a perception, but what this was on July 9, 2009, was a 
newspaper  article.  It  didn’t  present  evidence.  Newspaper  articles,  as  we  all  know, 
can have basis in facts and they can have lots of flour put around them to make them 
more interesting. I can only go on what the evidence was that day and that’s where 
I got to.”

8.19 

In those answers Mr Yates failed to deal with the fundamental point that it could be perceived 
that he did not approach the exercise with a wholly objective mindset. He also appeared 
not to grasp that it mattered not at all whether he was aware of any evidence implicating 
Mr  Wallis  personally,  not  least  because  before  he  embarked  on  the  fact-finding  exercise 
he had no way of knowing what evidence Operation Caryatid had uncovered or what the 
alleged “suppressed evidence” comprised. Finally, after a number of questions on the point, 
he appeared to accept that there was at least the appearance of a lack of disinterestedness 
because of his close friendship with Mr Wallis,439 although he has since made clear that he 
denies that it was a misjudgement to undertake the exercise and that he does not accept even 
that there was a perception that the decision-making for which he was ultimately responsible 
was not independent and impartial.

8.20  Mr  Yates  has  also  since  argued  that  had  the  fact-finding  exercise  uncovered  any  hint  of 
potential wrongdoing by Neil Wallis personally, then he would at that point have declared a 
conflict of interest and handed the exercise over to a colleague. I have no doubt that this is 
correct, but it does not address the fundamental concern that the general allegation in the

354

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEGuardian and the circumstances could almost inevitably create concern that he might not 
approach the evidence with sufficient objectivity and independence of mind.

8.21  During his evidence Mr Yates was understandably eager to stress that in reality his friendship 
with  Mr  Wallis  had  no  bearing  on  his  decision-making.  He  sought  to  reinforce  this  by 
emphasising  that  there  were  “informal  checks  and  balances”.  Mr  Yates  gave  the  example 
that it would be nonsense to suggest that an officer like DCS Surtees would accept a perverse 
decision just because Mr Yates was a senior officer.440 Whilst factors such as these support my 
conclusion that the decision-making of Mr Yates was not in fact distorted by his friendship 
with Mr Wallis, they would not have prevented the perception forming that it was, and that 
perception is capable of undermining public confidence in his decision.

8.22  Mr Yates suggested that it could only be said that his decision to undertake the fact-finding 
exercise was wrong when viewed with hindsight, informed by knowledge of “the cover-up 
undertaken by News International”. I simply do not accept that argument: in my judgment, 
the facts that made it inappropriate for him to look into the allegations made by the Guardian 
were known at the time. I also observe that the position of Mr Yates was internally inconsistent. 
On the one hand his thinking was to the effect that “this is nothing, we do this all the time, it 
is no big deal”; but on the other hand, he clearly thought it was sufficiently important that he 
should deal with it himself and that it was necessary for an Assistant Commissioner to ‘front’ 
the consideration of the article and, very quickly, to speak to the press about it. There was no 
question of delegating the task.

8.23 

If it was sufficiently important for him to deal with, he ought to have raised with the Deputy 
Commissioner, Tim Godwin, or Sir Paul Stephenson whether it would be better if someone 
else undertake the exercise because the deputy editor of the NoTW was his friend. I conclude 
this discussion by making clear that I do not suggest that, in reality, he approached the task 
with anything other than complete integrity and in good faith. Having said that, accepting 
and retaining the task was, at the time, a misjudgement on his part.

8.24  Sir Paul believes that Mr Yates did not give thought to whether there was a conflict of interest 

because of a defensive mindset:441

“I suspect that defensive mindset set in very early, for all the reasons I outline, that 
stopped us challenging ourselves, that stopped us going back and challenging what 
was the reason for the original investigation stopping short, albeit we didn’t know it 
stopped short. I think that is the more likely reason why Mr Yates didn’t decide that 
he had a conflict or not.”

8.25 

It is certainly a plausible explanation. Fully articulated (as put by Mr Rhodri Davies QC in his 
closing address for NI) it is that Mr Yates (and indeed DCS Williams) did not interpret the 
Guardian’s article as a non-judgmental suggestion that the practice of voicemail interception 
merited another look. Rather, he saw it as an unjustified attack on the integrity of the 2006 
investigation  that  it  did  not  occur  to  him  to  consider  whether  it  was  appropriate  for  him 
to carry out the exercise. In addition, this latter question did not subsequently strike him 
because he made up his mind within the space of what can only have been a few hours that 
there was no need to look further and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy, least of all 
one involving Mr Wallis.

para 8.66 below

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E8.26 

It is right that Sir Paul knew that Mr Yates was a friend of Mr Wallis (although he said that he 
did not know the extent of the friendship).442 Sir Paul very frankly admitted that he did not 
make the connection. When it was suggested to him that it might have been inappropriate 
for Mr Yates carry out the exercise, he said:443

“I think you’re crediting me with a level of analysis that I wouldn’t and didn’t give 
to  this  matter.  It  was  just  another  headline,  a  sort  of  –  I  don’t  mean  to  say  this 
dismissively – some noise about an event that I expected someone to pick up and 
deal with … I didn’t connect it with Mr Wallis. I didn’t give it any particular thought.”

8.27 

It does not seem, however, that Sir Paul would have acted differently even if he had made 
the connection between Mr Wallis and the allegations made by the Guardian. Sir Paul said in 
evidence that:444

“Had  [Mr  Yates]  come  back  to  me  with  this  …  I  might  have  expected  him  to  get 
somebody  within  his  business  group  to  deal  with  it  and  ensure  there  could  be  no 
allegations of impropriety against him. I do have to say – this is hypothesis and we’re 
speculating just a little, sir – that probably Mr Yates would have felt that he was more 
than equipped to deal with it. It is not as if, in our professional lives, that we don’t 
actually, as chief constables and senior officers, investigate people who are known to 
us socially and who have been friends, and to actually say somebody else has to deal 
with it would almost be saying that I do not have sufficient integrity to deal with it.
“Whether, with hindsight, it might have been wise to do that, I think that’s an entirely 
different question. I can understand why he didn’t do it, but with hindsight it might 
have been wise.”

8.28  Sir Paul was challenged on his evidence that chief constables and senior officers investigate 
people  known  to  them  socially  and  who  have  been  friends.  He  clarified  his  evidence  as 
follows:445

“Well, as a police officer, when I’ve been asked to do discipline and complaints in the 
past going back years, yes, I’ve investigated people who have been known to me.”

8.29  This  clarification,  in  fact,  answers  a  different  question  to  that  being  addressed.  When 
dealing with complaints against the police and internal discipline issues it is inevitable (and 
particularly so in a small force) that officers will have to deal with colleagues who are known 
to them. That is very different from leading or taking part in the investigation of civilians who 
are personal friends (or, I might add, investigating organisations in which personal friends 
hold leadership responsibilities). There are strict rules about conflicts of interest of this type 
(including the maintenance of relationships with those who are under investigation) and I do 
not anticipate for one moment that Sir Paul was distancing himself from those rules.446

The “fact-finding” exercise
I turn now to the exercise that was conducted to find the facts, which Mr Yates started and 
on which he announced his conclusion all within the same day as the article had appeared in 
print, namely 9 July 2009.

8.31  Mr  Yates  explained  that  he  received  informal  briefings  about  the  investigation  before  he 
chaired a Gold Group meeting at 11:00hrs: this was a formal meeting to discuss facts and 
record decisions. Mr Yates said that numerous people who had worked on the enquiry at 
various levels were involved, including DCS Williams, DCS Surtees and D/Supt Southworth.447 
According to DCS Williams, he was with Mr Yates for most of the day, explaining to him what 
the police had done during the original investigation. The documents shown to Mr Yates were 
the strategy for informing potential victims, a copy of the indictment and a short briefing 
document.448

8.32  There were three problems with the process that was adopted on that day. The first and 
fundamental problem was that none of the officers, including DCS Williams, who had overall 
responsibility for briefing Mr Yates, were given any real opportunity to refresh their memory 
of the nuances of what had been a comparatively complex investigation, involving seizure of a 
vast quantity of material, difficult issues of law and the overwhelmingly important competing 
demands consequent upon the threat of terrorism. Mr Yates did not wait for the documents 
(including the decision log) to be retrieved from storage, leaving DCS Williams with access 
only to the memories of the officers available to discuss the investigation and to very limited 
documentation.449

8.33  Mr Yates has submitted that before he reached any conclusions he ensured that DCS Williams 
and  senior  members  of  his  team  had  satisfied  him  that  they  had  a  full  recollection  of  all 
salient points of the investigation. It was, however, quite unrealistic of Mr Yates to expect that 
the officers could do so in such a short time, even if they believed they could. This briefing 
was  about  the  material  discovered,  the  actions  taken  and  the  decisions  made  just  short 
of  three  years  beforehand,  when  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  officers  had  since  been 
involved in extremely complex counter terrorism investigations. They could not conceivably 
have remembered all the detail, let alone appreciate that what they had intended to happen 
by way of exit strategy had not been followed through.

8.34  The minutes of the Gold Group meeting450 indicate that Mr Yates approached the task by 
asking some perceptive questions. These included the question: “Why was there not a more 
wide ranging investigation?” According to the minutes, he was told that the reason was that: 
“There was no evidence to expand the investigation wider, which, if it had done, then this 
would have been an ineffective use of public resources.” Further, in answer to the question: 
“What other journalists were involved?” Mr Yates was told: “There was no evidence at that 
time to implicate involvement in [sic] any other journalists”. Under the heading “Reopening 
of investigation” it was written: “No evidence to justify”. In all likelihood it was DCS Williams 
who gave these answers and communicated this message to Mr Yates because it appears

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ethat he was the only officer present at the Gold Group meeting who would have had any 
knowledge of the detail of the investigation.

8.35  Leaving aside the question of whether the evidence uncovered by Operation Caryatid ought 
properly  to  be  labelled  as  direct,  circumstantial  or  inferential  evidence,  it  is  important  to 
note from the outset that the message communicated to Mr Yates was not that there was 
“some  evidence”  that  the  criminality  extended  beyond  Mr  Goodman,  but  that  there  had 
been insufficient evidence to prosecute other journalists (which, as I have found, was the 
understanding, in 2006, of the officers involved in Operation Caryatid, including DCS Williams). 
Instead, it appears that in the mind of DCS Williams on 9 July 2009, that understanding had 
become a belief that, although there had been plenty of speculation that other journalists 
had been involved, the sum total of the evidence uncovered by Operation Caryatid was not 
capable of being taken forward or developed as part of a wider investigation. It is quite likely 
that this initial briefing provided the prism through which Mr Yates viewed the information 
he was given in subsequent oral and written briefings.

8.36 

I consider that the answers given by DCS Williams did not accurately reflect not only the value 
of the material that the police had seized but also the way in which the investigation had 
been brought to an end. Given the haste with which this “fact-finding exercise” was being 
undertaken, however, it is difficult to be over-critical of DCS Williams at this stage.

8.37  When he came to make a statement in September 2011, DCS Williams had obviously had the 
chance of reviewing the contemporaneous material in detail and so was able to deal with the 
matter rather more reflectively and in greater detail than would ever have been possible in 
July 2009. The contrast is obvious. The more recent explanation provides the context in these 
terms:451

“In the months following the arrest and right up to the prosecution … DAC Clarke’s 
decision to continue within the parameters as originally set and thereby not go any 
further  in  terms  of  the  material  seized  from  Mulcaire  and  Goodman,  remained. 
My  understanding  of  this  enduring  rationale  was  that  this  would  have  involved  a 
commitment of huge resources that could not be justified given the climate concerning, 
in particular, terrorism. On balance it was felt that the safety of the public was more 
important that protecting invasions of privacy; and that it was not the job of police to 
regulate the media, rather that it should regulate itself through the PCC.”

8.38  The differences are important. To say, for example, that there was no evidence to implicate 
other journalists (which, in any event, although the expressed view of DCS Williams did not, 
in  my  judgment,  start  to  be  an  accurate  analysis  of  the  material  available  to  the  police), 
is  not  the  same  as  saying  that  the  decision  not  to  go  further  was  based  on  the  resource 
commitment involved. It is worth adding, in parenthesis, that even if Mr Yates had waited for 
the records to be unearthed, he would not have found a record of the briefing given to Mr 
Clarke at the end of September 2006 or of the rationale behind the ultimate decision not to 
expand the investigation beyond Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire because there was no such 
record. A careful study of the decision log, the statements and interviews (which contained, 
for example, the references to other possible victims) would, however, have revealed a rather 
different picture to that which he had been given during the briefing.

8.39 

In  relation  to  the  absence  of  the  record,  the  MPS  submits  that  although  the  specific 
reasons were not set out in any detail, given the successful and widely reported charging 
and  subsequent  public  prosecutions  of  Mr  Goodman  and  Mr  Mulcaire  together  with  the 

451 para 44, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Witness-Statement-of-DS-Philip-Williams.pdf 

358

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEformulation  of  a  victim  strategy:  “it  should  have  been  evident  to  anyone  subsequently 
reviewing the decision that it was not made on the basis that there were no further leads 
to investigate.” It is sufficient for me to say that I do not understand how that follows: the 
prosecution and the strategy say nothing about whether there existed viable investigative 
leads when the decision was made to close down the investigation.

8.40  The MPS also submits that the lack of recorded reasons did not have any material impact on 
the 2009 decision, as the same officers who conducted the original investigation also provided 
detailed briefings and advised Mr Yates. Although true, the fact is that neither DCS Williams 
nor any other officer who spoke to Mr Yates on 9 July did, apparently, recall accurately why 
the decision was made by Mr Clarke and so did not provide a full picture for Mr Yates.452 If 
what records there were had been available, rather more detail might have come back to 
mind. I understand the reasons but it reveals an important flaw in what was happening on 
that day.

8.41  DCS Williams has submitted that although the final decision not to expand the investigation 
was not recorded, the decision log had considered the question of expanding the investigation 
and the issue of resources and that the final decision was part of that ongoing decision making 
process. He goes on to argue that Mr Yates knew why the operation had been closed down, 
but I have seen no evidence that Mr Yates was ever told, in terms which would have been 
sufficiently clear to correct the initial understanding he was given (that there was no evidence 
to expand the investigation wider), that Mr Clarke made the decision essentially on the basis 
of the necessary prioritisation of counter terrorism investigations so that his decision said 
little if anything about the quality of the evidence or viability of the leads. The fact remains 
that the rationale was not explained adequately to Mr Yates and a clearly recorded decision 
setting  out  the  rationale  would,  in  all  likelihood,  have  avoided  the  misunderstanding  that 
clearly arose. Suffice to say, I have little doubt that the answers given on 9 July to the questions 
posed by Mr Yates caused him to misunderstand the scope of what had been revealed during 
Operation Caryatid and to go on to approach the exercise from entirely the wrong angle, that 
is to say focusing exclusively on the question of whether the Guardian article had revealed 
any evidence that the police had not previously seen.

8.42  The second problem was that Mr Yates did not approach the exercise with any intellectual 
rigour  or  scrutinise  the  information  he  was  given.  As  explained  above,  crucially,  Mr  Yates 
pursued only the question whether anything was new: he did not pursue the questions which 
the article raised. It is clear from the minutes of the Gold Group that Mr Yates was informed 
that a large amount of material had been seized. Without undertaking a full scale review, in 
the light of the challenge to the MPS itself, it would have been sensible and responsive to 
the allegations in the article to ask a number of questions. Had the material seized from Mr 
Mulcaire all been analysed and, if not, why not? What was the basis of the decision to limit 
the indictment as drafted and (in relation to the counts on the indictment which it was not 
suggested involved Mr Goodman) to whom was Mr Mulcaire supplying that information and 
why? Who had caused Mr Mulcaire to obtain so many mobile phone numbers, PIN details and 
other material which, on the face of it, could give rise to the inference that he was seeking to 
get information by intercepting voicemail messages? Was it right that not all possible charges 
were pursued against News Group personnel? Was there any material to suggest that other 

452 In a different sense, it may have made less significance because DCS Williams has maintained at all stages what I 
have concluded is his mischaracterisation of the material gathered during Operation Caryatid as amounting to “no 
evidence” that journalists other than Mr Goodman were involved in a conspiracy to intercept communications. It 
would still have been wrong not only because of the identified contraventions of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 but 
also the inchoate offences of conspiracy and the fact that the indictment had not proceeded on the narrow view of the 
law

359

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ereporters were involved? It does not appear that any detailed consideration was (or, indeed, 
could have been) given to the substance of what was being alleged.

8.43  Mr Yates wrote himself a file note on 9 July (or within 24 hours)453, in which he recorded 
the “Principles to be adopted regarding Operation Caryatid and request by Commissioner to 
establish the facts around the case”. He included in his list of principles the “Scale, scope and 
outcome, in terms of the original case”, “Any complexities and challenges around the evidence 
then and any advice they have provided” and “The level of disclosure and who had reviewed 
what material”.454 Had Mr Yates explored properly these headlines, which he set for himself, 
he would (or should) have ascertained the true factual position, namely, that the police held 
vast quantities of documents that had not been analysed and very few of which had been 
reviewed  or  considered  by  the  CPS  or  Counsel  (save  only  for  the  very  limited  purpose  of 
disclosing unused material). He might also have learnt that, although the terrorism threat 
fully  justified  limiting  what  was  to  be  done  in  Caryatid,  there  was  an  entirely  reasonable 
view that there had been a number of viable leads that could have been pursued had the 
investigation continued.

8.44 

8.45 

8.46 

Instead, Mr Yates appears to have accepted at face value the information provided by DCS 
Williams,  relying  only  on  his  memory.  Mr  Yates  was  asked  to  what  extent  he  tested  the 
proposition  that  there  was  no  evidence  to  implicate  other  journalists.  Mr  Yates  replied 
that he would have asked whether counsel and the CPS saw the evidence and whether the 
unused material was reviewed properly.455 Given that the CPS was only asked to consider 
the investigation actually undertaken and that the purpose of reviewing unused material is 
limited, the nature of the allegations made by the Guardian meant that this approach was 
plainly insufficient.

In explaining his limited approach, Mr Yates relied on the fact that he was not briefed that 
there was circumstantial or indeed other evidence which implicated journalists other than Mr 
Goodman.456 DCS Williams has accepted that the initial briefings he gave Mr Yates were not 
as thorough as he would have liked and were conducted from memory, without the benefit 
of documents, all as part of a hurried response to the Guardian article. It is undeniable that if 
DCS Williams along with his team of officers had been able to recreate for Mr Yates the much 
more nuanced state of the investigation and the context within which operational decisions 
had been taken, Mr Yates would have been in a better position to consider the matter and is 
unlikely to have publicly expressed himself on 9 July as he did. I am simply not in a position to 
say whether he would have reached a different conclusion.

I also accept the general principle that it is essential to the efficient functioning of the MPS 
that a senior officer is able to rely on the total accuracy of the information given to him by 
officers under his command, and I do not doubt that DCS Williams intended to brief Mr Yates 
entirely accurately. However, these matters are by no means a complete answer for Mr Yates 
because he had to ensure that he had elicited all material facts from DCS Williams before 
relying on the latter’s assessment of those facts. Given the very specific allegations made by 
the Guardian, Mr Yates should have required DCS Williams to explain precisely what had been 
discovered that could potentially implicate journalists other than Mr Goodman, whatever the 
quality of the information (giving sufficient time to review the material gathered, perhaps

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEeven to speak to the case officers, such as DI Maberly, who had been “hands-on” during the 
investigation). Mr Yates, as the senior officer in charge of deciding what the response of the 
organisation to the Guardian article should be, ought then to have considered for himself 
whether there were evidential leads and whether there ought to be a scoping exercise with a 
view to deciding whether the full investigation should be re-opened.

8.47  Further, Mr Yates not only failed to require a more measured review of the position but he 
positively refused to allow it to happen before announcing his conclusions. The action points 
of the Gold Group meeting on 9 July simply did not include a review of the papers in storage 
or the decision logs. This need not have taken a great deal of time but Mr Yates decided upon 
a very speedy response rather than mature reflection. By not establishing accurately all the 
relevant facts, Mr Yates proceeded on the false assumption that there was no material in 
police  possession  that  could  justify  reconsideration  of  Operation  Caryatid;  thereafter,  the 
only question of any interest to Mr Yates was whether the Guardian article revealed any “new 
evidence”.

8.48  This, then, is the third problem with the exercise that was undertaken on 9 July. The minutes 
of the Gold Group meeting indicate that it was clearly decided at an early stage that there 
was no evidence to justify reopening the investigation: almost immediately, Mr Yates (and 
DCS  Williams)  had  decided  to  dismiss  the  Guardian  article  in  its  entirety.  The  final  action 
point was for the Directorate of Public Affairs to prepare press lines for Mr Yates to deliver 
to  camera  outside  New  Scotland  Yard  that  afternoon.  Although  DCS  Williams  went  on  to 
retrieve the papers and write a paper with DCS Surtees, the course had been set and a public 
denunciation of the Guardian delivered. Whatever emerged when the papers were retrieved 
and the decision logs reviewed, it is difficult to see how the MPS would have been able to 
move away from the decision so quickly and so publicly announced.

8.49  This is borne out by the minutes of the Gold Group meeting which suggest that the police 
were  more  astute  to  manage  aspects  of  public  relations  than  to  review  the  investigation. 
As the MPS has accepted, the exercise was framed too narrowly and the decision had all 
the hallmarks of haste and none of reflective calm. Lord Blair expressed the same view in 
evidence:457

“From what I can see, that decision was just too quick. It was just why could you not 
have gone back with all those allegations and looked further into what was – what 
did the material actually say?”

8.50  The result was that, on the afternoon of the day of the Guardian article, Mr Yates issued a 
press release458 publishing his conclusion that no additional evidence had come to light since 
the prosecution of Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, and therefore that no further investigation 
was required. In the press release Mr Yates stated that:

“This  case  has  been  subject  of  the  most  careful  investigation  by  very  experienced 
detectives. It has also been scrutinised in detail by both the CPS and leading Counsel. 
They  have  carefully  examined  all  the  evidence  and  prepared  the  indictments  that 
they considered appropriate.”

8.51  This statement was inaccurate. It is known now that neither the CPS, nor Counsel, nor indeed 
the investigating officers, had examined all the material for evidence of the involvement of 
other journalists. It suggested that the material seized from Mr Mulcaire had been thoroughly

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eexamined and every evidential lead pursued as far as it could be with the results put before 
the CPS and counsel for overarching advice on the widest range of outcomes. Put simply, that 
is not what happened: the material had not been analysed for evidence incriminating others.

8.52  Mr Yates has claimed that DCS Williams assured him that counsel had spent two days reviewing 
the  material  and  that  no  additional  suspects  had  been  identified.  Given  the  submissions 
made by DCS Williams on this point, it is quite possible that he provided that assurance but 
any inquiry would also have revealed that counsel had not been tasked with reviewing the 
material in order to advise on the extent to which there was evidence of the involvement 
of others. Not only had counsel not analysed the material for that purpose: neither had the 
police. Indeed, as explained below, if such an exercise had taken place, it could not have been 
concluded within two days.

8.53  Both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees have argued that it was their understanding that counsel 
did “examine” all the material seized during the investigation and DCS Williams has submitted 
that it was the responsibility of the CPS both to advise on charges and to assess whether 
further evidence was required for the prosecution. With respect, the role of counsel is not to 
act as investigators and, unless specifically so instructed (which is not suggested) it is wholly 
unrealistic  to  suggest  that  it  included  examining  all  the  material  for  evidence  that  might 
justify further police investigation against anyone not, at that stage, even the subject of any 
focused investigation.

8.54  When explaining why no further investigative steps were taken in 2006, the officers gave clear 
evidence that pursuing the investigation would have required a comprehensive analysis of 
the documents seized and that such an analysis would have been an enormous undertaking 
and not a straightforward exercise. Mr Clarke and DCS Williams have explained that given 
the nature of the material (which included hundreds of unstructured handwritten pages),459 
it was not a question of reading what had been seized from start to finish. Analysing the 
material would have required a time-consuming and systematic analysis of the papers, with 
the need to create schedules and spreadsheets of the material in order to cross-reference 
all  the  information.  Mr  Yates  would  have  known  that  any  review  of  unused  material  for 
the purposes of identifying exculpatory material would not even have approached such an 
involved exercise.

8.55  Mr Yates also addressed in the press statement the question of the number of victims of 

unlawful voicemail interception:

“Their  potential  targets  may  have  run  into  hundreds  of  people,  but  our  inquiries 
showed that they only used the tactic against a far smaller number of individuals.
…
“It  is  important  to  recognise  that  our  enquiries  showed  that  in  the  vast  majority 
of  cases  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  show  that  tapping  had  actually  been 
achieved.”

8.56  Given the discoveries that Operation Caryatid had made, these statements were also wholly 
inaccurate. The fact that a substantive offence could not be made out for purely technical 
reasons  would  not  give  the  ‘potential  targets’  comfort  in  terms of  measuring  the  level  of 
intrusion to their privacy but it should also be reiterated that the commission of a criminal 
offence under the CMA did not depend for its proof on the precise timing of the interception.

362

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEMr Yates explained that these statements reflected his genuine understanding and that they 
were based on the information he had been given:460

“That is definitely what I thought at the time, and it was in good faith, based on the 
briefings I’d received, but I absolutely accept now that I got that wrong and I made a 
fundamental misjudgment there.”

8.57  The minutes of the Gold Group meeting461 demonstrate that Mr Yates was briefed as follows:

“3000 names
During  searches of defendants premises, large amount of material seized, names, 
numbers  etc.  One  defendant  was  a  private  investigator  and  as  they  had  accessed 
mobile phone company systems, they had interest and potentially access to numerous 
people/phones. There was no evidence to prove criminally any other persons phone 
had been intercepted. There was strong evidence that they had intercepted 3 Royal 
family  aides  phones  and  a  further  5  other  high  profile  people,  all  of  which  were 
subject to the charges and proceedings in court. Wider people were not informed as 
there was no evidence to suggest there was any criminal activity on their phones”.

8.58  DCS Williams was asked during his evidence whether it was correct that the tactic had only 
been used against a far smaller number of individuals. He replied: “It was from my perspective 
of what would constitute an interception. I totally understand that there is a different view on 
that now.”462 Even if the narrow interpretation of RIPA were correct, however, and therefore 
that the police had only positively proved voicemail interception in a small number of cases, 
the statement was nonetheless misleading because it suggested that the police had been 
able to rule out voicemail interception beyond that small number of victims.

8.59 

It also appears therefore that DCS Williams erroneously put forward the need to apply the 
narrow  interpretation  of  s1  of  RIPA  as  one  of  the  reasons  why  the  investigation  was  not 
widened in 2006. Both DCS Williams and DCS Surtees have submitted that counts 16 to 20 
were contained on the indictment in order to “test” the law.463 DCS Williams said this was 
agreed by the CPS and Counsel to see if the convictions could be secured despite having no 
proof that an interception had taken place. There is no doubt that DCS Williams misunderstood 
or failed accurately to remember the more nuanced advice given by Counsel in August 2006 
at the conference he attended and that DCS Surtees acquired the same misunderstanding.

8.60 

It  is  surprising  that  DCS  Williams  appears  to  have  briefed  Mr  Yates  that  others  were  not 
informed on the basis there was no evidence to suggest that there was any criminality in 
relation to their mobile phones, because the victim notification strategy, which DCS Williams 
had to hand that day, had been designed to ensure that large numbers of potential victims 
were informed because the only criterion was that the “suspect” numbers had dialled their 
unique voicemail access number.

8.61 

It is noteworthy that, on 22 February 2012, when he signed his witness statement, Mr Yates 
apparently still believed that there was no unlawful interception unless it could be proved

463 That would suggest that Counsel were not relying on the narrower view of the law: as discussed above, a criminal 
charge would not be pursued if counsel for the Crown did not consider it sustainable as a matter of law

363

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ethat the interception took place before the relevant voicemail message had been heard by 
the intended recipient.464

8.62  The important questions that arise from this analysis of events are:

(a)  why  Mr  Yates  carried  out  this  exercise  in  such  a  hurried  way,  without  any  proper 

consideration of the serious allegations made by the Guardian;

(b)  why DCS Williams was prepared to brief Mr Yates in unqualified terms without refreshing 

his memory fully from the decision logs and case papers and did so inaccurately;

(c)  why, within a matter of hours of the Guardian article, both men decided to dismiss the 

(d) 

article in its entirety; and
to what extent, if at all, can the matters of concern in (a) to (c) above be explained 
by the relationships Mr Yates enjoyed with individuals at NI or the relationship more 
generally between the MPS and NI.

8.63 

In my judgment, the approach taken by Mr Yates can be explained entirely by the inappropriately 
dismissive and closed-minded attitude he adopted from the outset. This attitude stemmed 
from two main factors. The first was that he appeared to give less credence to the allegations 
than they deserved simply because they were made in a newspaper article. The second is the 
defensive mind-set alluded to above. Mr Yates provided an important insight into the level of 
respect he had for the allegations during his evidence when he said:465

“This was a simple exercise and one of a number of exercises that the Commissioner 
or Deputy would ask ACs like me to do almost on a weekly basis. It was an article in 
a newspaper, and it was no more, no less than that. So the fact that I sort of cleared 
my diary and did something relatively formal around this, recognising some of the 
challenges, is actually qualitatively different than many times you’d do it. So it’s what 
it was. It was an article in a newspaper. Events make that look very different, I know, 
but give me the credit, this was an article in a newspaper, that’s what it was about. 
It wasn’t a formal review.”

8.64  Further, when asked whether the issues raised by the Guardian were wide-ranging, serious 

and important Mr Yates said:466

“… One looks at the invasion of privacy uncovered by Motorman and Glade and the 
sentences they got there, which was conditional discharges, so I would not put it at 
the serious end. What we know now puts it at the very serious end, but in July 2009 it 
was phone hacking. I was three months into a new job as head of anti-terrorism, we 
were dealing with the fall-out of a very difficult operation up in Manchester, which 
was still going, numerous other high-profile operations involving the security of the 
state. This did not present itself as a hugely serious thing in 2009.”

8.65  Whilst  Mr  Yates  cannot  be  criticised  for  judging  the  relative  seriousness  of  voicemail 
interception as markedly less grave than terrorism, this expression of his thinking reinforces 
the view that he did not apply himself fully to the task. Mr Yates has since added that it is 
relevant context that he was pressed with challenging work in relation to the ongoing fight 
against terrorism and the numerous high priority operations in progress. I do not challenge

364

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEfor one moment that he would have faced such pressures, but it would have been perfectly 
reasonable  for  him  to  discuss  with  Sir  Paul  or  his  Deputy,  Tim  Godwin,  the  delegation  of 
the task of addressing the Guardian’s allegations to a Deputy Assistant Commissioner or a 
Commander, or to raise with them any general resourcing concerns that might have precluded 
a proper assessment of the allegations: his “new job as head of anti-terrorism” and the role 
of his department were, indeed, of critical importance but there was no point in accepting 
responsibility for doing the exercise if he was not prepared to make sure that it was done 
properly.

8.66  Regarding  the  defensive  facet  of  the  attitude  assumed  by  Mr  Yates,  Sir  Paul  Stephenson 
offered the following view why the decision not to reopen the investigation was made and 
maintained:467

“I think that what happened in 2009 is that within the Met, we developed a fixed 
mindset and a defensive mindset around this whole issue … I think that mindset was 
based on a number of issues, none of which are an excuse as to why we didn’t get this 
thing right … I think the start of that mindset was very much about: it’s inconceivable 
for people in 2009 to believe that an inquiry led by Mr Clarke would limit itself for 
any  improper  purposes  …  I  think  after  that,  in  the  absence  of  [establishing]  what 
the Met had in its possession – I think that’s been rehearsed in this Inquiry and in 
various places. That’s regrettable. That absence caused the Met to be more and more 
convinced that the original investigation, therefore was a success in totality, and of 
course that wasn’t the case … what we didn’t do is go back and actually challenge the 
reasons for those decisions in 2006 … We didn’t go back and challenge the reasons 
why it was limited because we didn’t know that it was limited, and had that taken 
place,  we  might  have  been  in  a  better  place  …  I  then  go  on  to  think  that  we  got 
ourselves almost hooked on a strategy – on a defensive strategy that we would not 
expend  significant  resources  without  new  or  additional  evidence  …  the  defensive 
mindset  we  established  was  very  much  based  on  the  flawed  assumption  that  the 
original one was successful investigation in totality and the absence of challenge, I 
think, led us into some difficulty, if that makes sense.”

8.67  The MPS accepts the criticism that it adopted a defensive state of mind. It is worthwhile to 

add that Lord Blair commented:

“But I am clear, and I’m quite prepared to say it, that was a decision that appears 
too hasty, and I thought some of the way in which Sir Paul Stephenson suggested 
the closed mindset of because it had been Peter Clarke who had made the decision 
and he was so respected, it was a very interesting piece of what you can describe 
sometimes as group think.”

8.68 

I find that this defensive attitude was an important factor in explaining the approach taken 
by Mr Yates.

8.69  The limited respect Mr Yates had for the allegations by virtue of the fact that they appeared 
in  a  newspaper  combined  with  his  belief  (albeit  justified)  in  the  absolute  integrity  of  the 
2006  investigation,  no  doubt  largely  because  Mr  Clarke  had  been  at  its  helm,  translated 
into  a  real  reluctance  to  challenge  or  revisit  past  decisions.  This  attitude  prevented  him 
from  standing  back  from  the  article  and  assessing  its  allegations  dispassionately,  despite 
the fact that this is what he had been given the responsibility for doing. In my judgment, it

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E8.70 

explains his willingness to accept at face value the assurances given by DCS Williams that the 
investigation was exhaustive. It led him, almost inevitably, to the peremptory conclusion that 
the investigation would not be reopened. It resulted in “a swift and offensive response”, as 
described, accurately in my judgment, by Mr Rhodri Davies QC in his closing address. I must 
make it clear, however, that I do not find that there is any evidence from which to infer that 
any relationships with NI in general, or Neil Wallis in particular, contributed to this attitude 
or approach.

It is undeniable that Mr Yates demonstrated poor judgment in failing to have sufficient respect 
for the allegations made in the Guardian article. The article was not tittle-tattle. On its face 
it was a well-researched piece of journalism. It was significant that three years had passed 
but the matter remained of real interest to a credible journalist. I also find it significant that 
Sir Paul Stephenson (who had only heard about the article on the radio) thought it raised 
sufficiently important issues that he wanted an officer as senior as Mr Yates to “look at it”. 
Furthermore, the then Home Secretary, Rt Hon Alan Johnson MP, said in evidence that at the 
ACPO conference on 9 July the first conversation he had with Sir Paul Stephenson, in a quiet 
corner, was about the article. It was unacceptable to treat it in the way that Mr Yates did; 
it was not the same as any ‘article in a newspaper’. It both demanded and merited a more 
considered and careful response as the reputational damage to the MPS has since amply 
demonstrated.

8.71  The defensive mind-set outlined by Sir Paul Stephenson also largely explains the approach 
taken by DCS Williams. DCS Williams accepted in evidence that his response to the article 
was influenced or indeed governed by his perception that the Guardian was alleging that the 
police had tried to hide something:468

“… maybe it’s the wrong perception, my feeling was that they were very much saying 
we were trying to hide something, so my – that’s my impression from the coverage, 
and I’m trying to say there was absolutely no intention to hide anything. And this is 
what I’m trying to articulate to Mr Yates.”

8.72  DCS  Williams  has  since  accepted  specifically  that  he  was  defensive  but  denies  that  this 
prevented  him  from  carrying  out  an  open  minded  and  dispassionate  re-evaluation  of  the 
decisions  taken.  I  regret  that  I  do  not  agree.  Being  open-minded  would  have  led  to  his 
appreciation that there were, indeed, other potential victims and other evidence to examine 
(as  he  has  accepted  that  he  knew)  with  the  result  that  there  was  sufficient  in  the  article 
to  justify  rather  more  detailed  consideration  than  the  few  hours  it  was  given.  If  he  had 
remembered the pressure on resources at the time, being open-minded would have led him 
back to the papers – not to re-open the investigation but to put himself in the best position 
to analyse the criticisms made of the police. In short, being open-minded meant that the 
allegations in the Guardian could not be dismissed within hours and DCS Williams should 
have appreciated that Mr Yates (who was entitled to rely on him) was doing just that (albeit 
without probing sufficiently or making sure that he understood all the ramifications of what 
had happened three years earlier).

8.73 

It is right that I deal with the further allegation that DCS Williams sought to persuade Mr 
Yates not to reopen the investigation. This was refuted by DCS Williams, who said: “I just gave 
an explanation of exactly what we’d done and the position we had reached”.469 I asked DCS 
Williams to explain why he presented to Mr Yates that there was nothing else to do when in

469 p4, lines 1-2, ibid

366

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEfact there was a great deal that could have been done, albeit that there were understandable 
reasons why those things were not done. DCS Williams said:470

“No, I see what you’re saying ... I’m thinking of it in my head as the evidence I didn’t 
have in my mind of what I would have needed to take that investigation forward, and 
if I’ve created the wrong impression, I’ve created the wrong impression. It wasn’t 
done intentionally. I’m trying to provide a briefing to my senior officer as genuinely 
as possible as to what we did and what we didn’t do then. I’m saying I haven’t made 
these decisions – I accept I’m responsible, I was the SIO, no question about that, but 
I haven’t done it in isolation, I have briefed and talked to a whole range of people 
and I always do that for the purpose of taking advice and talking things through. 
Ultimately my decision as SIO where we go with that – in the parameters I’ve been 
given with the investigation. I understand what you’re saying, but I was not doing 
anything here to mislead or create a false impression.”

8.74  The briefing DCS Williams gave was clearly inaccurate and, as set out above, by 2009, he 
appeared to have formed the belief that there was “no evidence” in police possession that 
then could or should be taken forward as part of a further investigation. It is unnecessary for 
me to attempt to make a finding on how he may have come to hold this belief, despite his 
contrary understanding in 2006. The effect of the passage of time, with numerous intervening 
investigations, combined with the defensiveness alluded to are a potential explanation, but 
for  the  purposes  of  the  Terms  of  Reference,  it  is  sufficient  if  I  make  it  clear  that  I  accept 
that DCS Williams was acting in good faith and I do not believe that he intended to mislead 
Mr Yates or that his approach was calculated to prevent the investigation being re-opened, 
whether to protect NI or any other improper purpose.

8.75  Related  to  the  question  about  the  extent  to  which  the  Guardian  article  merited  detailed 
consideration, Mr Yates was asked to explain why he did not wait for DCS Williams to provide 
him with briefing notes before issuing his press statement. He said:471

“… we’d established the facts and the facts were, then, that that Guardian article had 
some new information for the general public, but it wasn’t new to the investigators 
or to the police, and there was nothing – there was no new evidence presented by 
that article to warrant reopening the investigation at that stage. So I came out and 
said it. I could have waited a week, two weeks and choreographed it and spun it, but 
I didn’t. I said it as it was.”

8.76  Mr  Yates  was  right  to  conclude  that  the  Guardian  had  not  revealed  anything  that  would 
be new to the police, but that was precisely the point. The Guardian was alleging that the 
evidence should have been acted upon. What Mr Yates failed to recognise was that whether 
the Guardian had referred to new material was not the same question as whether re-opening 
the investigation might be warranted. It does not appear to have crossed his mind to ask DCS 
Williams for full details of what information there was that might possibly implicate other 
journalists. Mr Yates had also said:472

“If you look at the list of people who were present at that meeting, all very senior, 
all very experienced. If there had been a scintilla of evidence that said we should be 
doing something differently, I can absolutely assure you they would have challenged

472 pp64-65, lines 21-6, ibid

367

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eme and I’d have challenged myself and we would have done something different. The 
fact of the matter was, as I was briefed, there was nothing else in that article that 
led us to suggest that anything else needed to be done immediately regarding the 
investigation, or anything about the investigation.”

8.77  Mr Yates ought to have known that it was not safe categorically to state that there was nothing 
to warrant any reconsideration of the investigation, or to rely on the lack of contradiction by 
anyone present at the meeting, in circumstances where no one involved in the investigation 
had  had  proper  opportunity  to  refresh  their  memories  from  the  decision  logs  and  case 
papers. Further, the very fact of the pressure caused by counter terrorism operations could 
have alerted those looking back from 2009 to perceive the risk that a decision had been taken 
at least in part on the basis that, whatever else the material might reveal if further time was 
spent on it, there were far more pressing operational demands that took priority.

8.78 

It is remarkable that, even with hindsight, Mr Yates was not prepared to accept that, on 9 
July 2009, it would have been more accurate to have said that there may well have been 
evidence which implicated others, but that the decision was taken in September 2006 to limit 
the investigation because such evidence was insufficiently clear and operational demands 
required use of resources to deal with other, far more pressing, counter terrorism work. He 
said:473

“I  don’t  accept  that’s  the  case  either.  There  may  –  Keith  Surtees  may  have  had 
suspicions  and  those  suspicions  are  clearly  well-founded  now,  but  they  weren’t  – 
there was no evidence then. If there had been any evidence for us to pursue … You’re 
judging me on 2012 by what was taking place in July 2009 …”

8.79  Mr Yates was asked, directly, whether it was his opinion that there was no evidence at all to 

suggest that others might be involved, he said:474

“Well, there was the – you know, the long spoken about ‘for Neville’ email, which 
again  was  covered  in  terms  of  what  its  value  to  an  investigation  was  on  several 
occasions, not least by the DPP and counsel in terms of what it would value – its 
evidential value. There was nothing else that we knew differently then.”

8.80  He also said:475

“There was certainly a desire to go to the phone hubs and all that. The evidential 
challenges were paramount, and as far as I was aware from them were completely 
that they could not be overcome.”

8.81  Mr Yates said that he did recall the phrase “a sort of Mexican stand-off at Wapping HQ” but 
that:  “I  think  the  newspaper  lawyers  would  want  to  test  that  warrant  and  do  everything 
they could do to safeguard journalistic material. I wouldn’t necessarily think that would be 
an unusual turn of events at a newspaper”.476 It was put to him that this was part of the 
inferential picture of whether there was evidence generally speaking against others at the 
NoTW. He was asked if he saw the relevance of the obstruction from that point of view. His 
answer was: “I do and I don’t”.477

368

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE8.82  Mr Yates appears to have adopted without challenge, and maintained, the same mistaken 
appraisal  of  the  state  of  the  evidence  as  DCS  Williams,  namely  that  Operation  Caryatid 
had disclosed “no evidence” that journalists other than Mr Goodman had been involved in 
unlawful voicemail interception and had produced no viable leads. Mr Yates contended that 
lawyers and police officers have different opinions as to what might constitute “evidence” 
for these purposes. I did not find this distinction to be convincing: in my experience, police 
officers  have  a  well  developed  understanding  of  what  constitutes  evidence  and  the  more 
likely challenge arises when police officers seek to push the boundary of what is provable as 
evidence beyond that which a criminal lawyer will accept.

8.83  Apparently Mr Yates continued to fail to recognise that there was material in police possession 
that was capable of being taken forward. He maintained that it was only with the benefit of 
hindsight that his decision not to re-open the investigation was wrong:478

“I have also stated publicly that the decision not to reopen the investigation was a 
poor one in the light of what we now know … I had no way of knowing at that time 
the extent of the NoTW’s deliberate cover-up of the wider involvement of others in 
this activity.”

8.84  Although it is right that Mr Yates cannot have known the extent of the wrongdoing at the 
NoTW, or the extent to which it had been concealed, he undoubtedly did not require the 
benefit of hindsight to respond adequately to the Guardian article by identifying the reason 
why Operation Caryatid had not exhaustively pursued all possible leads, by discerning that 
there were parts of the Guardian article that generated concern and by taking rather longer 
to  consider  the  position  than  he  was  prepared  to  devote  to  it.  The  error  of  judgment  in 
deciding on immediate and prompt dismissal of the allegations by press announcement that 
afternoon should have been apparent at the time.

8.85 

It has been argued that I should not reach adverse conclusions without having heard from 
Carmen Dowd. For instance, Mr Yates has submitted that it was the advice she gave in 2006 
that influenced his approach to what was achievable given the limited resources available. 
The problem facing the police team in 2009, however, was not the advice in 2006. It was that 
it was known that there was an enormous body of evidence which had not been examined, 
yet it was decided that there would be no further consideration of the allegations unless 
there was “new evidence”; it would only have been at that stage, when deciding what steps 
to take in the light of the “new evidence” that Mr Yates would have considered resourcing 
priorities.

8.86  Finally, I must deal with two other aspects of the press release issued by Mr Yates on 9 July 

2009. The first concerns the Deputy Prime Minister and asserts:

“There has been a lot of media comment today about the then Deputy Prime Minister 
John Prescott. This investigation has not uncovered any evidence to suggest that John 
Prescott’s phone had been tapped.”

8.87  This statement was made not only in response to media comment, but also in response to a 
letter received that day from Lord Prescott (then the Rt Hon John Prescott MP). Lord Prescott 
had written to Sir Paul Stephenson asking whether the Guardian had been correct to allege 
that the MPS held the names of all those whose phones were targeted, including his, and if so, 
why the police did not inform those people or take any action.479 Mr Yates had also telephoned

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid ELord Prescott, before he spoke to the press, to reassure him that there was no evidence that 
his mobile phone had been the subject of voicemail interception.480 It is extraordinary that 
Mr Yates was prepared to give this assurance both to Lord Prescott personally and in his press 
release because it is clear from the minutes of the Gold Group meeting that DCS Williams 
was not able to state definitively that Lord Prescott was not a potential victim. An action 
point recorded in the minutes was that DCS Williams was to confirm the position; it noted: 
“If he had been subject to interception and evidence supported this then he would have been 
informed … ACTION – PW to confirm.”

8.88  The minutes suggest therefore that the assurance given by Mr Yates to Lord Prescott was 
based on nothing but an assumption on the part of DCS Williams, which he had not had time 
to confirm, that Lord Prescott could not have been a potential victim because if he had been, 
he would have been informed pursuant to the victim notification strategy. This is despite the 
fact that DCS Williams did not oversee the strategy to make sure that it had been executed as 
intended and, given that it was not in fact overseen by anyone else, DCS Williams could have 
received no confirmation that it had been put fully into effect.

8.89  DCS Williams has raised in submissions that in a written briefing to Mr Yates, dated 9 July 

2009, a DCS Timmons stated the following:

“Deputy PM John Prescott – PW and KS without reference to the exact documentation 
believe that Mr Prescott was not directly targeted although it is believed that members 
of his staff may have been. There has been no direct contact with Mr Prescott and 
he is not believed on the information available at this time that he was a ‘victim of 
interception’.”

8.90 

If  this  briefing  note  accurately  reflects  the  position,  then  it  gives  a  different  or  additional 
explanation  for  why  he  reassured  Mr  Yates  that  Lord  Prescott  was  not  a  potential  victim 
of voicemail interception. DCS Williams has submitted that at that time, the view of what 
constituted  ‘interception’  was  narrower.  DCS  Surtees  has  also  submitted  that  Mr  Yates 
accepted the narrow interpretation of “victim” and that up until 2010 everyone was working 
on that interpretation. This all indicates that DCS Williams and DCS Surtees, were briefing Mr 
Yates on the basis that an individual was only a victim if the police could prove that there had 
been an interception according to the narrow interpretation of s1 RIPA. It also indicates that 
they did not have in mind that whether someone was a “potential victim” was as important 
as whether someone could be proved to be a victim, given that the investigation had not 
been  exhaustive,  and  ignored  the  prospect  that  the  individual  was  a  victim  of  an  offence 
under the CMA or the target of a conspiracy.

8.91  The following day, after DCS Williams had apparently checked the position, he told Mr Yates 
that Lord Prescott had not been the subject of voicemail interception.481 Either DCS Williams 
gave Mr Yates this reassurance on the artificially narrow basis that a person could only be 
a victim (or potential victim) if voicemail messages left on his or her own phone had been 
intercepted, rather than voicemail messages received by people close to him/her, or, if this 
was not his approach, he gave the reassurance without checking the case papers because if 
he had carried out a reasonably careful review of the case papers he would have ascertained:

(a) 

either from the papers seized from Mr Mulcaire or from the record of interview of Mr 
Mulcaire on 9 August 2006 at 16:35 hrs, that Mr Mulcaire had recorded in his papers 
the name, John Prescott, with ‘advisor’ and then ‘Joan Hammel’ underneath and her

(c) 

telephone numbers and pass codes and an address in NW1; or
that on 30 August 2006 DI Maberly had emailed Vodafone asking if they could tell him 
whether anyone had listened to the voicemail of a number of people, which included 
“Tracey Temple (Prescott)”; or
that on 2 October 2006 DI Maberly had emailed O2 identifying two persons of concern 
and asking O2 if they featured in the analysis O2 was preparing: the first name was 
“Joan Hammell (linked to prezza)”.

8.92  Any of these would have alerted DCS Williams to the fact that Lord Prescott had, indeed, been 
suspected of having been either a potential victim or a possible target. Once it is appreciated 
that his staff have been targeted, it is not difficult to conclude that they were being used as a 
means of learning about his private communications.

8.93  Precisely what happened and the exact thinking of Mr Yates and DCS Williams on this issue 
could not be explored without recalling the witnesses and delaying this Report. That would 
not have been a proportionate step to take when the failure to notify Lord Prescott was so 
abundantly clear and the cause of that failure could be narrowed to some form of mistake or 
misjudgement rather than any improper influence connected to NI.

8.94  The second aspect of the press statement which requires further consideration is that Mr 
Yates stated that the MPS was taking all proper steps to ensure that, where there was evidence 
that people had been the subject of voicemail interception or there was any suspicion that 
there may have been, that they had been informed. The actions taken to comply with this 
undertaking and the extent to which they were successful are below.

The initial reaction of the CPS

8.95  Keir  Starmer  QC,  who  had  succeeded  Lord  Macdonald  as  the  DPP,  was  concerned  by  the 
assertions made in the Guardian, in particular the claim that deliberate decisions had been 
taken not to prosecute NoTW executives (which could have involved his staff). He therefore 
convened  a  meeting  at  which  he  asked  senior  lawyers  to  conduct  an  examination  of  the 
material  supplied  to  the  CPS  by  the  police  so  that  he  could  be  satisfied  that  appropriate 
action had been taken at the time. He also asked for a chronology, setting out the actions 
taken and the sources of information.482 Simultaneously, the office of the DPP came under 
pressure from the Home Secretary and the press to explain the nature of its involvement in 
2006:483 all this demonstrates the extent to which the allegation in the Guardian was not ‘just 
another article’.

8.96 

In contrast to Mr Yates, Mr Starmer explained that he took the Guardian article seriously both 
because of the important issue it raised and because of the number and seriousness of the 
requests coming in to him that day. They persuaded him that this was something he really 
needed to understand and that he needed to reconstruct the picture as quickly as possible.484

8.97  Mr Starmer became aware of the press statement that Mr Yates gave later that afternoon. 
This was some of the first information he received and: “given his position at the time, I have

371

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eto say I took it pretty much at face value in building up the picture”.485 At that stage, however, 
he  did  not  know  how  little  time  Mr  Yates  had  devoted  to  his  “establishment  of  the  facts 
exercise”. Later that same evening (9 July 2009) Mr Starmer issued his own press statement 
in the following terms:486

“I have no reason to consider that there was anything inappropriate in the prosecutions 
that were undertaken in this case.
“In light of the fresh allegations that have been made, some preliminary enquiries 
have been undertaken and I have now ordered an urgent examination of the material 
that was supplied to the CPS by the police three years ago. I am taking this action 
to satisfy myself and assure the public that the appropriate actions were taken in 
relation to that material.
“Given the nature of the offences, the amount of material is of course extensive and 
complex, but it has all been located and a small team is now rapidly working through 
it. This process will need to be thorough, so it will necessarily take some time. I am 
only too aware of the need for urgency and I will issue a further statement as soon 
as this work has been completed. I anticipate being in a position to do so in coming 
days.”

8.98  Again, in direct contrast to the approach taken by Mr Yates, in his press release Mr Starmer 
gave a provisional indication but reserved his position until a thorough examination had been 
conducted.

8.99 

It is important to appreciate that Mr Starmer intended that this exercise should be limited: 
the examination was confined to the material that the police had physically supplied to the 
CPS and not the unused material, because reviewing the unused material would have been 
an extensive and time consuming task.487 Thus, for example, the “for Neville” email was part 
of the unused material and so was not examined.488

8.100  This underlines the point made above: by its very nature, unused material is only examined 
for  the  purpose  of  disclosing  material  that  might  undermine  a  prosecution  case  or  assist 
the defence in a prosecution being mounted. For the DPP, the critical issue was to identify 
what the CPS had done in the light of the material that had been provided as part of a file 
to prosecute or advise on prosecution. This was a reasonable approach and the fact that Mr 
Starmer wanted some time taken over it also demonstrates a difference from the line taken 
by the MPS. As it happened, however, due to a misunderstanding, the team at the CPS did 
not  examine  the  entirety  of  the  evidence  in  their  possession.  The  overlooked  documents 
included the witness statements and exhibits used in the prosecution of Mr Goodman and 
Mr Mulcaire.

8.101  Unlike the police (where all the relevant officers, save for Mr Clarke, continued in service), the 
CPS in general and Mr Starmer in particular were hampered by the fact that Lord Macdonald 
was no longer in post and Ms Carmen Dowd had left the service.489 Throughout 2009 and 
2010, Simon Clements, the new Head of Special Crime Division, was responsible for briefing 
Mr Starmer on issues relating to voicemail interception490 although he had not been involved

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEin the matter in 2006 or 2007. Accordingly, the CPS was reliant, perhaps over-reliant, on what 
the MPS told it about the events of those years. The paucity of material available to the CPS 
at this early stage is demonstrated by the notes of a conference which took place with junior 
counsel, Mr Mably, on 10 July 2009.491 The principal point which he remembered was the 
need to “ring fence” the investigation in order to avoid personal embarrassment to Princes 
William and Harry. Unsurprisingly, he could not recall any of the fine detail of the case.

8.102  As if again to underline that this was not simply ‘just another article’, the 9 July 2009 also saw 
the Chairman of the Culture Media and Sports Committee (CMS) write to Sir Paul Stephenson, 
asking him to submit written evidence to the Committee concerning the investigation into 
voicemail interception.492

After 9 July 2009: the on-going response

8.103  The following day, 10 July 2009, Mr Yates convened and chaired a second Gold Group meeting 
“to seek update from yesterday’s meeting”.493 This time DCS Surtees was also present. The 
following is recorded in the minutes:494

“The original enquiry team (Op Caryatid) were aware that the defendant – Glenn 
Mulcaire was speaking to numerous people and other journalists to the very nature 
of  his  job.  The  MPS  sent  a  letter  to  News  of  the  World  asking  them  to  reveal  the 
phone numbers for their journalists so a comparison could be made on the seized 
data. It appeared [Mr Mulcaire] often used the News of the World switchboard so 
it  was  difficult  to  confirm  who  he was  speaking  with.  They  refused  to  co-operate. 
Telephone data went into 50,000 + and although further analysis could have been 
conducted to identify other journalists etc, it was decided in conjunction with CPS 
/ Counsel, to set parameters and from a proportionality point of view, to focus on 
evidence that would support charges and attract suitable penalty at court for the 
level of criminality involved. Effective use of Police resources was also considered at 
the time and discretion to investigate (R v Blackburn). The data examined did not 
unravel a conspiracy with other journalists so was not extended.
“If  the  MPS  were  to  consider  extending  remit  now  then  the  phone  companies  no 
longer hold the data so it would not be feasible to investigate. It is also worthy to note 
that the victims subject to interception, apart from the two convicted defendants, 
they did not have any other suspect / target numbers attempting to intercept their 
phones.
“[DCS Surtees] stated that during the S18 searches of News International the Police 
team met resistance and threats to use force to remove them from the premises. 
There was a general lack of co-operation on their part.”

8.104  These discussions brought to the attention of Mr Yates that evidence gathered did indicate 
that other journalists might be involved and that further analysis of the telephone data could 
have been conducted to identify other journalists, but that no analysis was conducted for 
reasons of proportionality. They also flagged to Mr Yates the strong resistance from NI to the 
search. They did not, however, cause Mr Yates to review his decision of the previous day. Even 
if Mr Yates did absorb that there was in fact evidence that might implicate other journalists,

373

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ehe appears just to have accepted, again at face value, that further investigation would not 
now be feasible. I am driven to the conclusion that having reached his dogmatic conclusion 
the previous day, he had closed his mind to the question of whether there might be material 
in police possession that could justify reopening the investigation.

8.105  This entrenched position is relevant when considering the protestations made by Mr Yates 
that it was not just an eight-hour exercise, but “a continuing exercise of reviewing, considering, 
reflecting about, you know, whether we were on the right track and whether we needed to do 
something different.”495 In my judgment, given the emphatic and publicly announced response 
on the previous day, to the extent that there was a continuing review at all, it was extremely 
focused, wrongly demanding nothing short of “new evidence” before consideration would be 
given to reopening the investigation. He accepted that after 9 July he did not continue with 
the establishment of the facts exercise. His evidence was that the continuing exercise “was to 
do with all about the victims, actually, all about the victims.”496

8.106  DCS Surtees has submitted further evidence497 in which he states that the minutes of 10 July 
2009 were not a wholly accurate reflection of what was discussed and that in this meeting 
and subsequent meetings he attended, he was vocal in advancing his view that the matter 
should  be  re-opened  and  re-investigated  for  the  very  reason  that  he  knew  there  were 
evidential leads to pursue and that the rationale for closing the investigation in 2006 did not 
exist in 2009. He states that he challenged Mr Yates and even suggested that Her Majesty’s 
Inspectorate  of  Constabulary  (HMIC)  should  be  appointed  to  investigate.  DCS  Williams,  in 
his  further  evidence,  agrees  that  DCS  Surtees  was  “quite  vociferous”,  at  his  first  meeting 
with Mr Yates in suggesting that he review or reopen the investigation or that HMIC have an 
independent look at it.498

8.107  DCS Surtees was not asked about 2009 when the evidence was called and Mr Yates has not 
been asked to respond to what is now said. In the circumstances, as a matter of fairness, I 
am not prepared to reach any conclusion on this issue. By 10 July, however, the scene had 
been set both by the briefing given by DCS Williams and the press announcement of the 
previous day: it would have required considerably more than DCS Surtees calling for a review 
to persuade Mr Yates to alter the course he had fixed in place. Furthermore, to be fair to Mr 
Yates, it is right to note that in the briefing note to which DCS Surtees contributed, dated 12 
July 2009, and considered below, the evidence was not represented in a way that steered the 
reader to the conclusion that there were viable leads.

8.108  It is appropriate next to refer to the fact that, on 11 July 2009, an article written by Andy 
Hayman was published in The Times. In that article, Mr Hayman claimed that the original 
investigation  had  “left  no  stone  unturned”  and  that  if  there  had  been  the  slightest  hint 
that  others  were  involved,  they  would  have  been  investigated.  These  were  extraordinary 
assertions to make given the true scope of the investigation and given that Mr Hayman was 
not in a position to comment on the thoroughness or otherwise of the investigation because 
he was not aware of any of the details. Further, having retired, he had no access to any of the

broad recollection, of how events were”.500

8.109  I  am  satisfied  that  Mr  Hayman  was  not  deliberately  intending  to  mislead  and  neither  do 
I  consider  it  to  be  proved  that  he  was  motivated  by  a  desire  to  protect  NI  from  further 
investigation; unwisely, however, he made defensive assertions which were based not on fact 
but on his assumption that the investigation would have been comprehensive. He undoubtedly 
believed the detectives working on Operation Caryatid to be tenacious investigators and that 
they would have sought to prosecute all offenders against whom there was a sufficiently strong 
case. In reality, without the relevant information, he set about defending the investigation 
(and,  by  extension,  both  himself  and  his  former  colleagues).  Furthermore,  it  was  equally 
imprudent of Mr Hayman to write this article in The Times because, by doing so, he gave the 
impression, no doubt inadvertently but undeniably, that he was being deployed by NI to give 
support to the police line which, itself, was in support of NI.

8.110  As  referred  to  above,  on  12  July  2009,  DCS  Williams  and  DCS  Surtees  prepared  a  written 
briefing  note  for  Mr  Yates.501  DCS  Williams  believed  that  the  briefing  note  may  well  have 
included more detail than he gave orally on 9 July: “particularly when it goes into quoting 
figures, because then we had retrieved the investigative documents from storage and so I 
would have been able to do that. On the day, I would – of 9 July, I would have been doing it to 
the best of my ability of my memory.”502 DCS Williams and DCS Surtees stated the following 
in that note:

“14 … It is clear from these documents that Mulcaire had been engaged in a sustained 
(years) period of research work in various levels of completion. In many there is simply 
the name of a celebrity or well known figure in others there is more detail with names, 
addresses,  dates  of  birth,  telephone  numbers,  DDN’s  passwords,  PIN  numbers  and 
scribblings of private information. On some there are names which probably relate to 
journalists and cash sums. (As yet unconfirmed).
“15.  It  should  be  noted  that  no  evidence  existed  to  suggest  that  those  possible 
journalists detailed on these sheets had knowledge of the illegal methods undertaken 
to supply these stories, however, it should be pointed out that in one of the recordings 
recovered from Mulcaire it is clear Mulcaire is giving instruction to an unknown person 
(possibly a journalist) on the telephone, on how to access messages of Gordon Taylor. 
(As yet unconfirmed who this person is).
“16. Also recovered were a number of contracts between Mulcaire and the News of 
the World, some show agreements to pay Mulcaire a wage of £104,988 per year … In 
addition to these contracts other financial documents recovered highlighted individual 
payments to Mulcaire from the NOTW for instance in the case of Gordon Taylor an 
agreement to pay £7000 once a story had been printed. (All used by counsel in the 
criminal prosecution).”

8.111  It was also claimed in the briefing note that:503

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ewas part of the prosecution case … Nothing has been hidden from the public as to 
what was found it has just not had the opportunity to be fully heard.”

8.112  The content of this briefing note leads me to the conclusion that even when DCS Williams had 
reviewed the investigation papers, his aim when briefing Mr Yates was only to reinforce the 
position that there was “no evidence”; that is not surprising given the view that he continues 
to maintain and, additionally, the fact that three days earlier Mr Yates had announced that 
there  was  nothing  new  to  consider.  The  conclusion  reached  on  the  value  of  the  “corner 
names”,  at  paragraph  14  of  the  note,  appears  to  have  been  infected  with  the  inaccurate 
analysis that there was “no evidence” that those identifiable by the corner names knew that 
Mr Mulcaire was obtaining the information unlawfully (when in fact there was circumstantial 
or inferential evidence of the same).504 It is clear that the note conveyed that the officers 
suspected that the criminality went far beyond just Mr Goodman, but it did not convey any 
belief that there was material that could be developed in a wider investigation. In the light 
of what he has recently argued, it is surprising that DCS Surtees did not ensure that this was 
communicated in the written document.

8.113  It  is  evident  that  this  briefing  note  introduced  Mr  Yates  to  evidence  implicating  other 
journalists, albeit the evidence was not given the epithet: “corner names”. It is right that the 
evidence was immediately followed by the assertion that “no evidence existed” that those 
journalists knew of the illegal methods used by Mr Mulcaire, but it gave Mr Yates the “scintilla 
of  evidence”  that  he  had  protested  he  did  not  have.505  During  his  evidence  Mr  Yates  said 
that he did not know about the “corner names”.506 When taken to these paragraphs of the 
briefing note, he said that they “didn’t hit home in that way”.507 I find that this reference to 
evidence implicating other journalists did not “hit home” precisely because of his closed and 
defensive mind-set, which caused him to overlook the significance of these paragraphs. That 
said, during his evidence, he did not accept that there was in fact any evidence that those 
named knew of the particular method of obtaining the information used by Mr Mulcaire:

“… who knows what techniques, lawful or unlawful, private detectives use and how 
they  get  the  information,  you  know,  I  can’t  be  the  judge.  What  we  were  worried 
about was is there any evidence around this, and the view I was given was: no, there 
wasn’t.”

8.114  Mr Yates, like DCS Williams (and in the briefing note of 12 July 2009 at least, DCS Surtees), has 
failed to acknowledge the circumstantial or inferential evidential value of the corner names or 
to consider how the communications between journalists and Mr Mulcaire might have come 
about or how the information which Mr Mulcaire obtained might have been passed back to 
the journalist. I do not pass further comment or reach any further conclusions, however, not 
least  because  of  the  current  criminal  investigations  and  impending  prosecutions  of  other 
journalists at NoTW and my anxiety not to prejudice let alone appear to prejudge what might 
emerge at any trial.

504 It is suggested that “no evidence” in this context does not mean there were no lines of investigation or no suspicion 
of criminality but that they did not have available at that time sufficient evidence to charge other people. It might 
be that the officers intended to convey this to Mr Yates, but it would have been entirely reasonable for Mr Yates to 
interpret the reference to “no evidence” not as meaning “insufficient to prosecute” but that there was no evidence 
capable of being developed
505 This is whether or not the reference to “no evidence” was no sufficient evidence to prosecute as opposed to no 
evidence capable of being developed

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE8.115  The following extract from the briefing note illustrates that DCS Williams and DCS Surtees 
had  reminded  themselves  accurately  that  there  were  many  potential  victims  despite  the 
continued adherence to the narrow interpretation of s1 of RIPA:

“It was clear from the spreadsheet and the lines of data supplied by the telephone 
companies  that  many  potential  ‘victims’  existed  and  had  been  subject  to  their 
voicemails  being  called,  but  that  is  not  sufficient  to  prove  the  criminal  offence 
of  interception.  The  burden  is  on  the  prosecution  to  show  they  actively  led  to  the 
defendant gaining access to voice messages prior to the intended recipient gaining 
access. The data alone does not even show whether or not messages existed only that 
the voicemail had been accessed.”

8.116  The following is also recorded in the briefing note:508

“… Advice indicated that S1 RIPA interception or Computer Misuse Act might be the 
potential offences for what was happening. The latter apparently had a poor track 
record in terms of conviction, because of the complexity of what had to be proved and 
the latter had not been used in respect of telephone voicemail …”

8.117  This indicates that DCS Williams had refreshed his memory from the papers sufficiently to 
recall that voicemail interception was not just an offence under RIPA but also under the CMA. 
Further, at paragraph 28 of the briefing note DCS Williams and DCS Surtees recorded that the 
victim strategy, in broad terms, had been to inform everyone in the bluebook who had had 
their unique voicemail access number dialled by the suspects. It continued:

“At the time the strategy recognized that there was still extensive research to be done 
with the phone companies to identify what the full extent of victims might be and 
therefore as outlined under the section above ‘How were victim identified’ this could 
be a vastly bigger group of people and in reality we would probably never know the 
true scale.”

8.118  Unfortunately, however, neither of these factors caused DCS Williams to correct his original 
briefing to Mr Yates concerning the number of victims of voicemail interception which was 
to the effect that “police enquiries showed that the tactic of voicemail interception had only 
been  used  against  a  far  smaller  number  of  individuals”.  In  the  light  of  the  way  that  DCS 
Surtees now puts the matter, it is surprising that DCS Surtees did not himself later correct this 
misunderstanding: by then, of course, the decision had been made and the defensive line 
published. Whatever the reason, however, I am confident, however, that it had nothing to do 
with any relationships with NI.

8.119  Sir  Paul  Stephenson  explained  that  during  intermittent  discussions  with  Mr  Yates,  as  the 
Guardian  maintained  its  coverage,  Mr  Yates  continued  to  reassure  him  that  there  was 
nothing new in the allegations that would warrant the reopening of the investigation and the 
investment of significant additional resources.509 To put his involvement in its proper context, 
Sir Paul said that the matter was not a priority for him as Commissioner. He occasionally had 
discussions with Mr Yates about it, but he would not have delved further into it because it 
was getting the right level of senior attention.510

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E8.120  Mr Yates chaired two Gold Group meetings on 13 July. The first was attended by DCS Williams, 
Mr Clements and Mr Hussain from the CPS, and D/Supt Dean Haydon.511 That meeting dealt 
predominantly  with  the  question  of  ensuring  that  the  MPS  had  been  sufficiently  diligent 
in informing potential victims but there was also discussion about whether a letter should 
be written to the Guardian encouraging the newspaper to share any new information. The 
minutes stated:512

“Following DPA advice, JY decided not to write a letter as the Guardian to date had 
not produced any fresh information or evidence in their articles. Their articles were 
based on historical cases. If he did, the Guardian could use spin and claim that he 
has made a U-turn, had done this under mounting pressure, why was this not done 
before etc. Press reporting to be monitored in event fresh information comes to light 
to justify writing a letter. Decision – no letter to be sent to the Guardian at this stage.”

8.121  According to Mr Clements, Mr Yates told them at that meeting that he was happy to help with 
“piecing together the evolution of the prosecution strategy regarding potential victims”.513 
Mr Clements and Mr Hussain told Mr Yates that a review was underway and that they would 
reveal their findings on Wednesday in a press release.514

8.122  The second Gold Group meeting was attended only by MPS personnel, including DCS Williams 
and DCS Surtees. A separate investigation name, Operation Quatraine, was allocated in order 
to provide a reference point for work done on the recent issues and the costs incurred. Mr 
Yates decided that the Gold Group would provide strategic oversight and that all decisions 
and records would be recorded in the minutes and that no separate decision log would be 
maintained.515

8.123  On 14 July 2009 the journalist Nick Davies, who had been responsible for the Guardian article, 
gave evidence to the CMS Committee. He presented the Committee with copies of a number 
of  documents  including  the  “for  Neville”  email  and  the  contract  with  Mr  Mulcaire  which 
related to the payment of a bonus for the Gordon Taylor story.

8.124  Also on 14 July 2009 David Perry QC and Louis Mably produced the note to which reference 
has  already  been  made  (see  paragraph  3.2  above).516  The  key  part  of  the  note  was  the 
following:517

“We  did  enquire  of  the  police  at  the  conference  whether  there  was  any  evidence 
that  the  editor  of  the  News  of  the  World  was  involved  in  the  Goodman-Mulcaire 
offences. We were told that there was not (and we never saw such evidence). We 
also enquired whether there was any evidence connecting Mulcaire to other News of 
the World journalists. Again we were told that there was not (and we never saw any 
such evidence).”

511 Detective Superintendent Haydon was the staff officer to Mr Yates and attended the Gold Group meetings which 
responded to the Guardian article. He was subsequently appointed as the SIO of Operation Varec: para 9.8 below

516 I have found (see para 3.19 above) that the “for Neville” email did not form part of the documentation sent by the

CPS and Counsel were aware of the existence of the contract

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE8.125  This  record  of  the  answers  given  by  the  police  understandably  influenced  the  conclusion 
reached by Mr Starmer of how the original prosecution had been handled and the extent to 
which there was any need for a re-evaluation in 2009.518

8.126  Mr Yates also claimed to place heavy reliance on this note from counsel but in contrast to 
Mr Starmer, it was not reasonable for Mr Yates to infer from it that counsel had checked 
all the material gathered during the investigation for further evidence of criminality. First, 
the conference was prior to the review of unused material and was based purely on what 
counsel were told by the police; secondly, Mr Yates knew (or certainly ought to have known) 
that the review carried out by counsel (Mr Mably specifically) had been confined to a review 
of the unused material which had the particular limited purpose of fulfilling the disclosure 
obligations explained above.

8.127  When challenged about the legitimacy of relying on this review of unused material, given 
its purpose and that Mr Mably had not been asked to decide how the investigation should 
proceed, Mr Yates accepted the limited nature of the exercise but said that:519

“This was quite an important limb, I would say, in terms of saying, well, okay, he was 
looking at it from the CPI perspective from the indictment, but if counsel is telling 
me that they never saw any such evidence, then of course I’m going to place some 
reliance on that. But it was only one limb of a series of aspects which enabled me to 
come to that view, if you like.”

And:520

“Well, if you read out the sentence in the note, I think it’s abundantly clear what’s 
there, and on any reading, exculpatory, CPIA or whatever, they are saying they’ve 
done  the  exercise  on  CPIA  and  they  never  saw  any  such  evidence  about  others’ 
involvement … I can’t see any other reading of it that would – you know, it’s there.”

8.128  Whilst  it  would  be  fair  to  find  that  Mr  Yates  might  have  expected  counsel  reviewing  the 
unused material to notice a document that stood out as a “smoking gun”, he could not rely 
on it to conclude that there was no evidence of further criminality.

8.129  On  15  July  2009,  the  Chairman  of  the  Home  Affairs  Committee  (adding  weight  to  the 
enquiries being conducted by the CMS Committee) wrote to Sir Paul Stephenson in order to 
put a serious of questions to the MPS. 521 He asked to be informed of the extent of previous 
police enquiries into illegal surveillance by journalists, in particular, whether journalists other 
than  Clive  Goodman  were  investigated  and  why  Mr  Yates  was  convinced  that  no  further 
investigation  was  needed.  He  also  asked  whether  there  was  any  evidence  to  indicate  the 
existence of arrangements between Mr Mulcaire and other journalists, either at the NoTW 
or elsewhere, which could have included intercepts and other potentially illegal surveillance.

8.130  Also on 15 July 2009 DCS Williams sent an email to the CPS which contained his recollection 
of the August 2006 conference with counsel.522 Mr Hussain also prepared a submission for

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ethe DPP which set out in summary form the CPS involvement in the case in 2006.523 Perhaps 
the most important part of it for present purposes was paragraph 3, which read:

“In  addition  to  Goodman  and  Mulcaire  a  third  man  ...  was  arrested  but  was  not 
charged due to there being insufficient evidence to proceed against him. NO other 
suspects were considered or charged. This has been confirmed to Asker Hussain by 
DCI  Surtees:  ‘no  other  named  suspects  ...  were  confirmed  as  suspects  of  criminal 
activity through this investigation’. Prosecution counsel has also confirmed that there 
were no other suspects apart from these three individuals.”

8.131  The precise content of any conversation between Mr Hussain and DCS Surtees cannot be 
ascertained from this note, but I would expect DCS Surtees not to have given the impression 
that there were no evidential leads relating to named individuals even though there were no 
“confirmed suspects” as such.

8.132  On  16  July  2009,  following  receipt  of  this  submission  from  Mr  Hussain,  the  DPP  issued  a 
press statement. It stated that the police had provided the CPS with all relevant information 
and that the approach to charging Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire had been appropriate. It 
is noteworthy that the press release relates only to those ‘identified to the CPS’ and reads as 
follows:524

“Having examined the material that was supplied to the CPS by the police in this case, 
I can confirm that no victims or suspects other than those referred to above were 
identified to the CPS at the time. I am not in a position to say whether the police had 
any information on any other victims or suspects that was not passed to the CPS.”
“In  light  of  my  findings,  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  re-open  the  cases  against 
Goodman or Mulcaire, or to revisit the decisions taken in the course of investigating 
and prosecuting them”.

8.133  Also  on  16  July  2009  DCS  Williams  wrote  a  report  entitled:  “Why  didn’t  we  expand  the 

investigation?” in which he stated that:525

“…  My  practical  assessment  was  that  no  matter  what  we  found  out  [once  the 
investigation  was  overt]  any  other  potential  suspects  were  now  firmly  aware  of 
what we were doing and would certainly be taking all steps to avoid incriminating 
themselves.
“Against this backdrop I knew how challenging it had been to get the case this far 
based upon technical proof (this is a huge challenge which perhaps understandably 
everyone is underestimating) and now that potential other persons who may or may 
not  have been involved were alerted my  belief was that  we would  not  be able  to 
secure the level of proof necessary to get across the criminal threshold.
“Added to the above I knew that any attempt by us would [be] highly likely to be 
protracted for the reasons already highlighted and it would risk clouding the issues 
around a solid, clear and proportionate case.
“All  of  the  above  was  not  a  decision  that  I  made  in  isolation.  Throughout,  this 
investigation had the highest oversight at all times. The potential breadth/scale of 
what may or may not be out there was fully discussed together with what resources

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEmight  have  been  required  to  even  begin  exploring  that.  There  was  no  appetite  to 
expand the investigation and the strategic guidance given to me was to continue with 
what I had before me as outlined above.”

8.134  DCS Williams argues that this report demonstrates he communicated to Mr Yates that there 
were  evidential  leads  and  that  the  strategic  decision  had  been  made  not  to  follow  them 
for resourcing reasons. In the context of the briefings, I do not consider that it would have 
conveyed any such message to Mr Yates. The report suggests that the decision was made at 
least predominantly (if not entirely) on the basis of the quality of the evidence and viability 
of the leads, rather than making clear that resource concerns overrode considerations of the 
quality of the evidence.

8.135  DCS Williams also set out his views526 on “what would be the issues should it be decided to 

now open an investigation into any aspects of NOTW activities from that period”:

“1. Maximum success already achieved – My rationale for what we did then I believe 
serves as a strong basis for why it would be highly challenging to find anything more 
that would lead to a criminal prosecution which would have any greater benefit in 
terms of what we have already achieved.
“2. Data – In terms of practical challenges I doubt whether the necessary data exists 
now. Even at the time Orange for example only hold what data they had for a few 
hundred  days.  So  for  example  to  explore  in  terms  of  data  whether  or  not  Gordon 
Taylor had been the victim of intercept in June 2005 or before as indicated by one 
seized document was not possible then let alone now.
“3.  Victim  Cooperation  –  I  believe  the  current  climate  is  making  an  assumption 
around who would want to come forward as a victim/witness. Given that the people 
who are targeted are in the public eye for one reason or another I suspect many of 
them would not want to [be] identified publicly as a ‘victim’ due to what it might 
suggest about their private life.
“4. Public Duty – Taking into consideration all that I have written above I do not feel 
we would be serving the criminal justice system for the public good, but all we would 
achieve is feeding the civil litigation industry for individual gain at much cost to the 
general public.”

8.136  In my judgment, this is another example of the way in which DCS Williams represented matters 
defensively and in such a way as to reinforce the decision that reopening the investigation 
was unwarranted.

8.137  Later that evening, on 16 July 2009, the press office of the DPP received an enquiry from Nick 
Davies as to whether the DPP had called for the NoTW contract and the “for Neville” email.527 
This enquiry promoted a flurry of late night activity within the CPS.

8.138  On 17 July 2009 Mr Yates chaired a further Gold Group meeting during which a question 
was raised about the possible involvement of Neville Thurlbeck (following a question to Mr 
Yates from Chris Huhne MP),528 in light of the “for Neville” email. According to the minutes 
of the meeting, DCS Williams stated that this formed part of his wider prosecution strategy 
relating to both suspects and victims, which was still robust to that day. The minutes also

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Edemonstrated that DCS Williams emphasised the lack of co-operation from NoTW during the 
investigation, including no comment interviews, resistance during the searches and refusal to 
cooperate with telephone data requests.

8.139  After  the  meeting,  but  also  on  17  July  2009,  a  briefing  note  was  prepared  for  Mr  Yates, 
presumably by DCS Williams, which explained the reasons for not having followed up the 
possible implications of the “for Neville” email.529 He stressed that the mere sight of transcripts 
of conversations is not itself sufficient evidence to charge with an offence of conspiracy to 
intercept communications. He explained that:

“It is important to differentiate the investigative strategy and risk reduction strategy 
taken at the time, to the very different focus today of whether in fact lots of journalists 
at the NOTW or elsewhere were involved in a criminal conspiracy.
…
“Police could have arrested Thurlbeck and/or others. The experience police had of 
the  stance  taken  by  News  International  staff  led  them  to  suspect  that  any  other 
journalists arrested would not readily assist police by answering any questions this 
would  inevitably  leave  investigators  with  insufficient  evidence  to  charge  others. 
Further  enquiries  were  undertaken  by  investigators  to  prove  the  involvement  of 
other  journalists  by  requesting  telephone  information  and  floor  plans  from  News 
International at the time. These were frustrated from the outset.”

8.140  For their part, during the course of 17 July 2009, the CPS ascertained that the “for Neville” 
material was part of the unused material and nothing more. A copy of the email was faxed by 
the MPS to the CPS later that day, and drawn for the first time to the attention of Mr Starmer. 
Mr Clements told Mr Starmer that he had spoken to D/Supt Haydon and that: “the Met do 
not consider that the email in question has the significance that the Guardian attribute to 
it.”530 Mr Starmer was immediately concerned about the email, because “[w]hatever view 
others took about this email, I was concerned about it. Taken at face value, it seemed to me 
to suggest that both the author and recipient were possible suspects”.531 In answer to my 
question, Mr Starmer indicated that his assessment of the email was that it was more in the 
nature of an evidential flag or pointer than a ‘smoking gun’, although, even on that basis, he 
recognised that it did not correspond with the reasonably firm assurance he had been given 
that there had not been thought to be other suspects.532

8.141  At 4pm on 17 July 2009 a meeting took place between Mr Starmer and David Perry QC. The 
latter confirmed his recollection of the answers the police gave to his questions regarding 
other possible defendants. However, Mr Starmer was still concerned about the email and 
decided to write to Mr Yates inviting him to consider whether further investigation was now 
required. A draft press statement had been prepared to that effect, but, following discussions 
with Mr Yates later that evening Mr Starmer was persuaded not to issue the statement but to 
meet Mr Yates the following Monday morning (20 July 2009) to discuss the email in greater 
detail. During the course of the Friday evening discussions which followed the meeting with 
Mr Perry, Mr Starmer sensed a degree of “push-back’ from Mr Yates against his suggestion 
that there should be a reinvestigation or further investigation of the “for Neville” email. Mr

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEStarmer did not suggest that there was anything sinister or untoward about this, given the 
time of day.533 Following those discussions, Mr Starmer issued a press statement which merely 
said: “the DPP is now considering whether any further action is necessary.”

8.142  On Monday 20 July, the meeting with Mr Yates and others (including DCS Williams) took place 
as arranged; the notes made on behalf of the MPS have been made available to the Inquiry.534 
Mr Starmer explained to the police that Mr Perry had told him that he could not remember 
discussing  the  “for  Neville”  email  at  the  time  of  the  prosecution.  DCS  Williams  reiterated 
the  point  that  there  had  been  discussion  about  other  possible  defendants.  The  following 
appeared in the notes:

“KS. David and Louis asked if evidence editor and other journalists. Told not. Saw no 
evidence to support”

8.143  Mr Starmer confirmed that this assertion was never contradicted by anyone present at the 

meeting.535

8.144  According to Mr Starmer, the key contribution made by Mr Yates to the meeting was that this 
was not new material; it had been seen by counsel and that the police investigation focused 
on  set  parameters,  which  were  an  operational  matter  for  the  police;  furthermore,  in  any 
event, “the email will go nowhere”. Unsurprisingly, Mr Starmer was not entirely comfortable 
with this response, given that Mr Perry did not have a recollection of seeing the email, and 
to the extent that it might have been seen by junior counsel this was in a specific and limited 
context; that the ‘set parameters’ rather begged the question; and that his assessment of the 
evidential strength of the email was not the same as the assessment made by Mr Yates. The 
matter was left on the footing that Mr Starmer would seek written advice from Mr Perry on 
the status of the email, and that DCS Williams would do a background note to avail him.

8.145  Shortly after 6pm that evening, DCS Williams sent the CPS a briefing note, as they had requested, 
which  he  entitled  “Challenges  faced  in  the  investigation  and  subsequent  prosecution”  for 
the CPS.536 Under the rubric “Challenges”, DCS Williams set out his understanding of the law 
which continued to be based on the narrow view of RIPA 2000. He also made a number of 
observations in the note about the “for Neville” email, all of which tended to suggest that 
neither in 2006 nor in 2009 could it amount to evidence that the criminality at the NoTW went 
beyond Mr Goodman. For instance, he set out his analysis that there was nothing to indicate 
that “Neville” had actually seen the document and that even if he had, reading the email 
would not have been an offence and so there was no evidence to link him to a conspiracy 
to intercept communications. It is worthy of additional note that this specific analysis of the 
email was also to form the basis of the evidence Mr Yates gave to the CMS Committee.

8.146  Mr Starmer was anxious to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and so he asked Mr Perry 
to provide an ‘overnight’ advice, that is to say before the following morning. In effect, the DPP 
wanted Mr Perry to answer the following four very specific questions:537

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eissues  associated  with  proving  offences  of  interception,  what  advice  would  he  have 
given to the CPS/police at the time in respect of the “for Neville” email, had it been 
brought specifically to his attention?

(b)  based on his knowledge at that time (July 2009), would his advice be any different?
(c) 

based  on  his  knowledge  in  2006  whether  he  was  of  the  view  that  the  police  had 
sufficient to arrest and/or interview “Ross” and/or “Neville”.

(d)  based on his knowledge at that time (July 2009) whether he was of the view that the 

police had sufficient to arrest and/or interview “Ross” and/or “Neville”.

8.147  At the time of the urgent request for advice, Mr Perry did not have access to his original papers 
and was also working under the pressure of a court appearance. Rather than seek further 
time from Mr Starmer, Mr Perry decided to rely on what he could recall of the prosecution 
and on the briefing note provided by DCS Williams. He set out his advice under the heading 
“Draft Advice” although it was not expressed to be contingent on any further information 
or input from either the MPS or the CPS and was never replaced by a further document. 
The advice arrived at the CPS at 09:40 hrs the following morning, namely 21 July 2009.538 
Mr Perry indicated that he only had a dim recollection of the decisions taken in relation to 
the investigation and prosecution strategy, but that he had found the note prepared by DCS 
Williams to be extremely helpful and to accord with such recollection as he did have. Mr 
Perry expounded the narrow view of the law in lapidary and unqualified terms:

“… to prove the criminal offence of unlawful interception contrary to section 1(1) of 
the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, it is necessary to prove that the 
message was intercepted before it was accessed by the intended recipient.”

8.148  Mr Perry also appeared to suggest that he gave the same advice to the police and the CPS 
in 2006.539 He stated in his advice dated 20 July 2009 that the “for Neville” email did not 
cause him to acquire a different view of the merits of pursuing other possible defendants. He 
adopted eight of the nine points made by DCS Williams in relation to the evidential value of 
the email.

8.149  Mr Perry has accepted that his statement about the law was too emphatic and that he had 
been  over-reliant  on  the  briefing  note.540  Given  that  he  did  not  have  his  papers  and  was 
advising overnight, I am fully prepared to accept the explanation why he expressed this view, 
despite having given different advice in the conference with the CPS and the police in August 
2006.541

8.150  With the benefit of hindsight, Mr Starmer has since said that it would have been better if, 
before Mr Perry committed himself, he had been given more time along with the opportunity 
to  check  his  papers.  That  is  undoubtedly  right  but,  despite  his  understandable  anxiety  to 
meet the very tight deadline set by the DPP, Mr Perry should not have given unequivocal 
and  unqualified  advice,  which  in  any  event  did  not  reflect  the  considered  advice  he  gave 
in 2006, without, first, re-acquainting himself sufficiently with the law and relevant factual 

538 Not published 
539 In an email dated 22 October 2009 Mr Mably also adopted the narrow interpretation (not published). Mr Perry 
believed that this may have been based on the “wrong turn” which he took in the Advice he drafted in July, which may

541 As I found at para 3.15 above, the advice Mr Perry gave in 2006 was that although the “narrow view” was arguably 
correct, the argument could be met in a number of ways and in any event the inchoate offence of conspiracy did not 
depend for its proof on the correctness of the narrow interpretation

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEbackground; secondly, reviewing his papers relating to the prosecution; and, thirdly, if it was 
necessary, reconsidering the likely interpretation of s1 of RIPA. He should not have permitted 
himself to rely almost entirely on a briefing note provided by DCS Williams (whom he did not 
blame) or to assume that it was accurate or reflected the advice he gave in 2006.

8.151  Although  it  might have caused  his  client some frustration,  I have no  doubt that Mr Perry 
should have told Mr Starmer that he needed more time before he could give accurate advice; 
alternatively,  he  could  have  expressed  a  view  only  on  a  provisional  basis  following  it  up 
shortly thereafter, when the papers were to hand and the necessary time available. Entirely 
accurately, Mr Perry summarised the position by saying that: “the moral of the story is: don’t 
do advices overnight if you don’t have the papers”.542

8.152  The DPP wrote to the chairman of the CMS Committee on 30 July 2009.543 Basing himself heavily 
on the advice given by Mr Perry, Mr Starmer confirmed that it would not be appropriate for 
him to reopen the cases against Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, nor to revisit the decisions 
taken in the course of investigating and prosecuting them.

8.153  On  25  August  2009  DCS  Williams  provided  what  he  called  a  “very  rough  draft”  opening 
statement for the CMS Committee hearing. It included the following paragraph which, in the 
circumstances, did not fully reflect the complete picture of what had happened in 2006:544

“Suspects – In 2006 Police, CPS and Senior Counsel considered whether or not there 
was evidence against anyone else and in the light of recent concern have revisited that 
decision. Supported by Senior Counsel the collective belief is that when set against 
both the investigation and prosecution strategy there was and remains insufficient 
grounds to arrest and /or interview anyone else.”

8.154  Presumably  for  the  purposes  of  the  CMS  Committee  hearing,545  DCS  Williams  prepared  a 
further briefing note, dated 2 September 2009, entitled “Efforts to pursue investigation with 
NOTW” which including the following information:

“Post arrest at a case conference between police, CPS and Council [sic] the extent of 
what we could legally ask for access to through a Production order was discussed and 
again based on the evidence we had that was deemed highly likely to be limited to 
the activities of Goodman and potentially Mulcaire – in affect [sic] we would not be 
allowed to do anything that might be looked upon as a ‘fishing exercise’.
“NOTW solicitors had already made it known of their desire to cooperate with the 
investigation and the best way forward was decided to be through cooperation, but 
to explore/prepare a production order in tandem to be used as legally possible.”

8.155  DCS Williams then explained how Burton Copeland had responded to the various request for 

information in the following terms:

“Throughout it would be fair to say that NOTW took a robust, but legal approach to 
our requests and provided the material in relation to Goodman and Mulcaire only, e.g. 
the payments to ‘Alexander’ – total £12,300. What was received did indeed become

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Epart of the prosecution, but we did not have the legal basis with which to push our 
investigation further.”

8.156  On 3 November 2009 the DPP wrote again to the Chairman of the CMS Committee. He set 
out in that letter that the advice given by Mr Perry had been that the narrow interpretation 
of s1 RIPA was correct and that there was nothing to be gained from seeking to contend for 
a wider interpretation.546 On the same day Mr Yates also wrote to the Chairman of the CMS 
Committee. He confirmed that the police had in their possession hundreds of “unstructured 
handwritten sheets” showing research into many people in the public eye. He said: “It is not 
necessarily correct to assume that their possession of all this material was for the purposes 
of interception alone and it is not known what their intentions was [sic] or how they intended 
to use it.”547

8.157  Before leaving this section, it is important to deal with the allegations that have been made 
about the integrity of Mr Yates. I recognise that I have strongly criticised his decisions not just 
with the benefit of hindsight (which is no criticism at all) but having regard to what he knew 
or could have discovered. As to the question of ulterior motive, however, it is important to 
analyse the evidence. On this question, Mr Yates said:

“… I absolutely know what I did on July 9th, I know what I was provided with, I know 
the judgment I made. You know, time has shown that to be – and what’s happened – 
not the greatest call, but at that time it was the right call, and it wasn’t influenced in 
any way, shape or form by other matters.”

8.158  Those who worked closely with Mr Yates were and are convinced of his integrity. DCS Williams 

(whom I have also criticised) said:548

“…  In  my  workings  with  [Mr  Yates],  I’ve  not  worked  with  him  directly  before,  but 
I  saw  nothing  or  heard  nothing  that  me  think  that  we  –  that  there  was  anything 
wrong going on here, that we were looking to hide anything. He was looking at an 
investigation that was four years old. I briefed him and over the period I believe he 
was genuinely seeking to understand what had happened and make proportionate 
decisions. I just want to assure you that I’ve seen nothing that makes me think that 
there is anything other than a genuine desire to do a proper investigation and to keep 
the public informed about what’s going on.”

8.159  As for more senior officers, Lord Blair offered the following assessment:

“Do I believe that John Yates took that decision in order to placate News International? 
No, I don’t. I just don’t believe that he did that. But his difficulty, without making it 
more difficult for him, is the number of contacts, and that, I think, is a problem.”549

8.160  Sir Paul Stephenson was convinced that Mr Yates acted in good faith.550 He added that: “I 
think we ended up defending instead of challenging. Do I believe that there was a deliberate

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEattempt to back off because it was News International? No, I do not, sir.”551 He made clear that 
he did not believe that fear of taking on a powerful enterprise “comes into it”.552

8.161  In reality, there is no evidence from which it would be right to infer that Mr Yates was swayed 
in  his  decision  making  by  his  friendship  with  Mr  Wallis  or  his  relationships  with  NI  more 
generally. That he did not take the Guardian article (or the follow up) seriously enough is 
beyond doubt but I do not believe that he was acting out of fear of NI, or in a desire to protect 
Neil Wallis or NI or, indeed, to garner favours from the organisation.

8.162  I have considered also the subtler point whether because he knew the personalities of the 
leaders at the NoTW and had amicable relations with them, he was less prepared to think ill 
of what they had been doing. I agree with Mr Garnham QC that I do not have the evidence to 
make such a finding. I do not consider there is any basis for concluding that Mr Yates would 
permit or did permit his own personal knowledge of individuals to influence his assessment 
of  whether  they  may  be  involved  in  obtaining  information  for  stories  by  criminal  means. 
Whatever conclusions I reach about the way in which Mr Yates went about discharging his 
responsibilities in 2009-2010, I do not challenge his integrity.

The second attempt to ensure that all potential victims had been 
informed

8.163  Having undertaken on 9 July 2009 to ensure that all suspected victims had been informed, 
on 10 July 2009, Mr Yates issued a press statement asserting that: “the process of contacting 
people is currently underway and we expect this to take some time to complete”.

8.164  In the briefing note dated 12 July 2009, DCS Williams and DCS Surtees told Mr Yates that 
although it was not known in detail what actions each mobile phone company took, the steps 
they did take included “contacting customers who they thought might have been a victim”.553 
They gave Mr Yates this assurance despite the fact that neither had ensured either that the 
phone companies understood that this was their responsibility or that the phone companies 
had, in fact, informed their customers. It is plain that Mr Yates was significantly misinformed. 
No doubt reassured by this briefing, at the first Gold Group meeting on 13 July 2009, Mr Yates 
gave DCS Williams and DCS Surtees the task of reviewing the remainder of the list to establish 
if there were any other potential victims that should be informed.554 He also gave DCS Surtees 
the responsibility of confirming, from the files, who the police had informed and when. It is 
fair to note that Mr Yates was, indeed, seeking to honour his public undertaking to ensure 
that all potential victims had been informed.

8.165  DCS Surtees has submitted that this tasking was predicated on the narrow interpretation of 
‘victim’, namely that a person was only a victim if there was proof that a voicemail message 
sent or received by him/her was intercepted before it was heard by the intended recipient. 
It is very surprising that DCS Surtees has made this submission given that it is wholly at odds 
with the wording of the original victim notification strategy and the summary of the victim 
notification strategy that he and DCS Williams gave in the briefing note of 12 July 2009. It 
is  also  at  odds  with  the  undertaking  Mr  Yates  made  on  9  July  2009  to  inform  all  victims, 
including those where there was “any suspicion” that they might have been victims and with 
the minutes of the second meeting on 13 July 2009, the relevant extract of which is set out in

387

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Ethe paragraph below. If this was the approach, it is difficult to explain how it developed. DCS 
Surtees does also make the point that the meetings record only a small part of the discussions 
that took place.

8.166  In the minutes of the second meeting on 13 July 2009, it was recorded that, over the weekend, 
the police had informed Andy Coulson that he was a potential victim and that attempts had 
been made to contact seven others, albeit only one of those seven attempts was successful.555 
The following was also noted:

“Over weekend. PW reviewed all files again and decided original victim strategy still 
stood re informing people (i.e. nothing had changed, apart from Coulson position) 
and after speaking with JY, it was decided no further contact was attempted with 
any other people. Weekend focus was then diverted to preparing briefing note and 
chronology of events.
“PW stated after reviewing list there were approx. 60 people with activity on their 
phones. JY asked rationale for not informing them now. PW stated they had been 
in contact with phone companies and they were compiling in writing what they did 
at the time. Response should [be] received in next 24 hours and therefore decision 
pended until we see phone companies’ response in event there could be duplication 
of work. Press line should read presently – not prepared to discuss (this is personal 
data).”

8.167  It is not clear how DCS Williams reached the conclusion that “the original victim notification 
strategy still stood” given the reality that it had substantially failed. The evidence indicates 
that this correspondence with the phone companies was the first attempt by the police to 
check that the phone companies had been notifying potential victims in line with the victim 
notification strategy.

8.168  On 14 July 2009 DI Maberly received a response from O2 to this correspondence from the 

police asking them about what steps they took following the investigation.556 O2 said:

“The matter was fully investigated, and information came to light indicating a small 
number of additional O2 customers who may have been targeted in the same way.
“All the O2 customers affected were contacted by the O2 Fraud & Security Team in 
May  2006.  The customers  were advised  that  there may  have been an  attempt  by 
a third party to access their voicemail messages. They were told we were making 
changes to the voicemail systems to stop this happening, and advised that O2 were 
working with the police to assist in providing evidence to identify and prosecute those 
responsible. Some customers requested their details be passed on to the police, and 
this was done.”

8.169  Vodafone  and  Orange  also  replied  within  the  month.  They  set  out  what  steps  they  had 
taken but neither mentioned having taken any steps to identify or inform potential victims 
of voicemail interception.557 Surprisingly, despite the imperative to identify individuals who 
might not have been informed and the clear instructions from Mr Yates, it does not appear 
that  the  police  made  any  attempt  to  follow  this  up  with  Vodafone  or  Orange  and  query 
whether they had notified any potential victims. Neither have I seen evidence that Mr Yates

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEsubsequently asked DCS Williams or DCS Surtees what had been ascertained from the phone 
companies.

8.170  On 22 July 2009, as part of Operation Quatraine, Mr Yates directed that all the material seized 
from Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire be scanned onto “ALTIA”. ALTIA was a relatively new 
IT system, which had not been available when the investigation began, which enabled the 
mass  scanning  of  hard  copy  exhibits  to  make  them  searchable  on  the  HOLMES  database. 
This was intended to assist the MPS in responding to the growing number of requests for 
information558 from individuals who were concerned that their voicemail messages may have 
been intercepted. An email drafted on behalf of Mr Yates indicated that the exercise was to 
be a priority. The email read:559

“It is of critical importance to the MPS and the command that this is progressed as a 
priority and this requires attention today please to coordinate.”

8.171  Mr Yates explained that around ten detectives spent over four months undertaking this task 
at a cost of over £200,000. It is noteworthy that those working on the exercise appear to have 
been directed that if, when examining the exhibits, they identified potential further leads for 
investigation, they should be referred to the SIO for consideration.560 However, no such leads, 
if identified at all, were brought to the attention of senior officers, and the task of scanning 
documents was not properly completed. Mr Yates said:561

“I mean … in fairness to me – on 23 July or whatever it was … I was so concerned 
about our inability to analyse the material in any shape or form that I asked for it 
to be put on the HOLMES system. You have that email in your pack, where I’ve said 
as a matter of priority I took people off counter terrorism operations to put all the 
material on the HOLMES system.
“Now, if during that exercise run by detectives who, you know, would have a detective 
outlook, I would have expected, if concerns began to be raised about what’s actually 
in that material, stuff that’s come out, that I would have been told, but that didn’t 
happen. So I was sufficiently exercised, as critical incident in the Met parlance, to 
put the stuff on a computer, to invest I think it was ten detectives for three or four 
months working long days to put all this material on a system so I could search it, so 
I could actually with confidence say – when people wrote in, I could say you’re either 
on the system or not on the system. Now unfortunately that exercise wasn’t done as 
thoroughly as it should have been.”

8.172  On 24 November 2009, having been contacted by Nick Davies for information about whether 
all potential victims had been informed, Orange wrote to DI Maberly in the following terms:

“We’ve drafted a press statement – the part relevant to the issue in question (i.e. if we 
were ‘asked’ to investigate and contact customers) is:
We were not asked nor felt it right to further investigate these customers as this was 
part of the Police investigation. We were also advised not to contact these customers 
as it could jeopardise the investigation and prejudice any subsequent trial.

389

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid EDo you think this is fair comment? ...”

DI Maberly replied the following day and said:

“I don’t think the comments are totally fair. Let me speak to our legal team / SIO 
(Senior Investigating Officer), who may have a documented record of the strategy 
agreed at the time.”

8.173  Orange replied within a few minutes and said:562

“Unfortunately  we  have  responded  but  would  be  happy  to  issue  a  clarification  if 
necessary. We’re not disputing that the ball was in our court, just that no specific 
[italics in original] request was made to investigate and contact…”

8.174  There  does  not  appear  to  have  been  any  real  reaction  to  the  implications  of  this  email 
correspondence or beginnings of a recognition that the victim notification strategy had failed.

8.175  On 25 January 2010, DI Maberly emailed O2 and Orange, explaining that following a review of 
material requested by DCS Williams, the police had identified a “very small” number of people 
who were a target for interception but who had not been informed of this. Presumably these 
were individuals who, pursuant to the victim notification strategy, should have been notified 
by the police. DI Maberly also explained that the police were intending to give the relevant 
numbers to the phone companies in order to ascertain to which network they belonged at 
the time and might then ask the phone companies to make contact with those customers. O2 
replied that day in the following terms:563

“We identified a number of customers we believed may have had their voicemails 
intercepted and I advised Philip Williams at the time that we intended to proactively 
contact them and let them know. We could not say for certain that their voicemail 
had been intercepted only that there was evidence it had been attempted. From my 
memory this was approximately 40 customers, certainly not more than that number. 
The only customers from this list we did not contact as part of that process were the 
members of the royal household that the police were dealing with directly. We had no 
information that voicemail messages belonging to any additional customers on the 
O2 network had been intercepted or had interception attempted.”

8.176  This demonstrates that O2 informed their customers because they made the independent 

decision to do so and not pursuant to a request from the police.

8.177  Orange  also  replied  the  same  day  stating  that  they  told  Nick  Davies  that  they  had  given 
the police the phone numbers of 45 Orange customers whose voicemails boxes had been 
accessed by the suspect numbers provided by the police.564

8.178  On 26 January 2010, DI Maberly spoke to a representative from Vodafone. She told DI Maberly 

that she did not confirm any numbers to Nick Davies.565

8.179  On  1  February  2010,  the  MPS  received  a  request  from  Nick  Davies  under  Freedom  of 
Information  Act  2000;  this  included  requests  for  the  total  number  of  full  names,  partial 
names and initials including possible misspellings and duplications, which were listed on the 
database and the total number of mobile phone numbers (full and partial).

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE8.180  On  9  February  2010,  Mr  Yates  wrote  again  to  the  Chairman  of  the  CMS  Committee  and 
contended that during his evidence in September 2009 he had answered the questions as 
fully as possible. He stated in that letter that:566

“… Since that appearance, and in accordance with my initial press statement, I have 
been  attempting  to  ensure  that  the  police  have  taken  all  proper,  reasonable  and 
diligent steps to inform all those individuals where there is any evidence that they may 
have been subject of any form of interception. This has involved considerable and time 
consuming work, in particular the use of an IT process previously unavailable. Even 
now we cannot with any certainty answer questions relating to identifying individuals 
and whether or not they were a victim of interception …
“… whenever a name in whatever context was identified it was captured and put onto 
an MPS system. The name could range from initials, single names right through to 
multiple variations and spellings of a host of fore and/or surnames. To even attempt to 
discern from the material to what extent this data refers to distinct individuals or for 
what purpose would have required extensive work beyond the scope of the criminal 
investigation and would not have been a proportionate use of police resources.
“A similar process would then have had to be undertaken to link phone numbers and 
or voicemail messages to these individuals.
“What we can say is that where information exists to suggest some form of interception 
of an individual’s phone was or may have been attempted by Goodman and Mulcaire, 
the MPS has been diligent and taken all proper steps to ensure those individuals have 
been informed.”

8.181  The latter paragraph indicates that the police had still failed to ascertain or recognise the 
extent of the failure of the victim notification strategy despite having identified, initially at 
least, the importance of notifying all those whose privacy had potentially been invaded.

8.182  DCS  Williams  prepared  a  report  entitled  “Options  for  Dealing  with  the  potential  ‘victims’ 
issue”.567 It is undated, but it is apparent from the content that it was drafted after the MPS 
received the request issued under the Freedom of Information Act but before the response 
which was dated 29 March 2010.568 DCS Williams made reference to the fact that DI Maberly 
had  examined  the  91  individuals  whose  names,  mobile  phone  numbers  and  pin  codes 
appeared in the papers seized from Mr Mulcaire and identified 13 people who:

“will not have been contacted by us and potentially the service providers and from 
the billing data provided as part of the original investigation, there are calls that are 
greater than 10 seconds (i.e. enough to enter the voicemail and listen to any message 
left as per the criteria used for the trial)
“Albeit not proved at an evidential level that interception has taken place, if the data 
is correct then there is a case for saying that for these individuals the possession of 
their name/mobile/pin has probably gone beyond more than merely preparatory and 
therefore there is suspicion that some form of ‘phone tapping’ may have taken place. 
The following are options for informing them.
“Option 1
“Police try to contact these people using the mobile numbers listed by Mulcaire and 
tell them that they fall into this category.

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“If we did this I would suggest we are quite firm on saying that we are not investigating 
the case, we are simply carrying out John Yates’ promise to inform people and if they 
have any concerns to contact their service provider.
“If we cannot contact them, because the phone is now out of use or has moved on to 
someone else then that would be the end of the process on the basis that we have 
‘been diligent, reasonable and sensible, and taken all proper steps.’
“Issues to consider: –
This case is now nearly 4 years old, we are not carrying out an investigation and all 
the  time  we  are  spending  public  money  on  something  that  is  not  making  anyone 
safer. At best we would be handing someone an opportunity to make personal gain 
through the civil courts which does not assist the wider public good.
It  probably  would  [be]  possible  to  undertake  further  enquiries  beyond  ringing  the 
phone numbers to try to contact those individuals. A view might be that some of the 
people are well known and it would have been ‘easy’ to make contact. However, it 
might not be as easy as it seems, because we could be limited in terms of our full range 
of research methods as this is not an investigation and that could delay notification in 
some instances. Equally the more lengths we go to [to] contact individuals, potentially 
through other people, we risk breaching their anonymity around this case, again for 
no great gain. Where is the balance of reasonableness?
For some of the 13 we are not sure who they are/their relevance in terms of known 
individuals.
This is something that could be done immediately, before the Nick Davies FOIA letter 
goes out.
“Option 2
We approach the service providers directly and/or through Jack Wraith (who originally 
coordinated much of the contact/press lines with the service providers) and supply 
them with details of these last few people and ask them to clarify whether or not they 
have any concerns and make contact with the customer.
“Issues to consider: –
This would share the responsibility for determining who is a ‘victim’ with the service 
providers as it was the weaknesses in their system that has caused all this work for 
us and in theory if they had any concerns back in 2006 they should have contacted 
their customers.
This would take an unknown time and it is important to send out the Nick Davies FOIA 
this week.
“Option 3
We could complete Option 1 immediately and then consider pursuing the remainder 
through option 2. If the combination of both did not make contact then that would be 
deemed reasonable and diligent.”

The paper did not reach a conclusion as to which option should be selected.

8.183  It is not clear whether any further victims were informed following this paper being written, 
but it does indicate a clear lack of enthusiasm for informing any further potential victims, 
despite the undertaking given by Mr Yates in July the previous year. It appears to have been 
considered to be a time consuming and expensive exercise for no real gain. There were to 
be no further charges and one of the purposes of informing potential victims was to enable 

392

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEthem to take steps, if so advised, to seek whatever redress they saw fit: the enforcement 
of privacy rights in the civil courts, therefore, did not appear to register with the police as a 
worthwhile outcome. In the circumstances, the lack of appetite for ensuring that all potential 
victims were informed was a misjudgement.

8.184  It was noted in the minutes of a Gold Group meeting on 10 September 2010 that DCS Williams 
was to provide a brief on the victim strategy to date. At a further meeting on 17 September 
2010 the approach for dealing with “potential new victims” was discussed. It was recorded 
that a strategy for new victims was being devised and that the proposed course was to write 
to each prospective victim and ask them to approach their service provider to see if they held 
any information to support their suspicion.569 There was also an action point requiring DCS 
Williams “to provide details to JY of notifications to potential victims”.

8.185  In  October  2010,  Nick  Davies  reported  that  he  had  contacted  the  mobile  phone  service 
providers and ascertained that not all the victims had been contacted. The MPS began asking 
the service providers, in terms, which victims they had contacted and asking them to notify 
those not yet contacted. It is remarkable that this had still not been done, particularly given 
the earlier correspondence from the phone companies which indicated that O2 had notified 
customers but only at their own instigation and that Orange and Vodafone had not notified 
any customers. The minutes of a Gold Group meeting held on 21 October 2010570 recorded 
that DCS Williams had completed the previous action that he provide details to Mr Yates of 
notifications to potential victims and that there was an on-going action involving liaison by 
DCS Williams with the telephone companies to establish which victims they had informed 
and cross-compare them with the list compiled by the MPS. The action continued: “If victims 
remain outstanding consideration of joint letter (MPS and telephone companies) to inform 
them accordingly”.

8.186  It was following this meeting that DCS Williams wrote to O2, Everything Everywhere (formerly 
Orange)  and  Vodafone  asking  them  whether  those  who  they  (the  phone  companies)  had 
identified as potential victims during the 2005 to 2006 investigation had been contacted.571 
He asked them, if they had not informed those potential victims, to make arrangements to 
bring to their attention the information that suggested they might have been victims. He also 
asked them to provide those customers with the MPS single point of contact. It is noteworthy 
that, even in this letter, DCS Williams was not verifying whether the original victim notification 
strategy had been implemented because that would have required him to ask whether the 
phone companies had completed the two stages: that is to say, they had both identified all 
customers whose voicemail boxes had been dialled by the suspect numbers and then notified 
those customers.

8.187  On  2  November  2010,  Orange  responded  stating  that  no  Orange  customers  had  been 
contacted and that at no point during the investigation, or subsequently, had the MPS asked 
Orange or T-Mobile to contact any potential victims.572 The letter also stated:

“Orange assisted the investigation by providing a list of mobile numbers that had 
been called by a set of telephone numbers supplied to us by the MPS. Orange has 
no  knowledge  if  those  Orange  mobiles  were  being  called  legitimately  or  with  the 
intention of attempting to access their voicemail without authorisation. This was part 
of the police investigation and for the MPS to identify.”

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E8.188  On 12 November 2010, O2 responded by saying:573

“I can confirm that the O2 customers identified in 2006 by us as potential victims of 
voicemail interception were contacted at the time and given advice …”

8.189  Finally, on 22 November 2010, Vodafone dealt with the enquiry in the following terms:574

“I am surprised that you say that you thought at the time of the investigation that 
“all  of  the  people  potentially  identified  as  being  ‘victims’  had  been  ‘contacted’  by 
Service  Providers,  including  Vodafone.  Whilst  we  were  able  to  furnish  the  police 
with information and data requested, it is not for Vodafone to determine who is a 
“potential victim” in a police led investigation … This is something for the police to 
establish and it is for the police to take such steps to inform potential victims of crime 
as they deem appropriate, which I accept could have included asking Vodafone to 
contact a given list of customers …
“A search of our files in relation to the matter has not revealed any request from your 
officers that we do otherwise”.

8.190  The police thereafter identified that in fact 58 people out of the list of 91 names with PIN 

numbers associated had not yet been contacted.

8.191  As regards this failure of this second attempt to ensure that all potential victims had been 
informed, Mr Yates said that the exercise had been conducted with the very best intentions 
but  that  it  was  “fairly  torturous”.575  Mr  Yates  accepted  responsibility  for  its  failure  and 
explained it as follows:576

“… the day-to-day management of the exercise to place all documentation on the 
Holmes computer was not at the level I expected or that was required. This resulted 
in  some  material  not  being  placed  on  the  system  which  resulted  in  incomplete  or 
incorrect responses to a number of people who were affected. This  is  a matter of 
great personal regret.”

8.192  It should be noted, however, that the process of scanning the documents in order to create a 
searchable database was not implemented to assist in positively identifying individuals who 
had not been informed but who should have been; rather it was to respond to individual 
requests for information from people who wanted confirmation whether or not they were 
potential  victims.  I  find  that  the  MPS  (and,  in  particular,  Mr  Yates,  DCS  Williams  and  DCS 
Surtees) failed to take effective steps, at any time before November 2010, to ensure that 
those potential victims who had not been informed were informed as soon as practicable. 
They failed even to realise that the victim notification strategy had failed or the extent of 
its failure until Orange and Vodafone spelled out in terms that they had not notified their 
customers, nor been asked to do so. These failings on the part of the police are difficult to 
explain. The most likely explanation in my judgment is that the officers concerned did not 
look beyond the assumption that it had worked, at least substantially. Once more, however, 
there is no evidential basis for inferring that the police approach was influenced in any way 
by relationships with NI.

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE8.193  It  is  worthwhile  briefly  to  revisit  the  failure  to  identify  that  Lord  Prescott  was  a  potential 
victim. By letter dated 15 December 2009, he was eventually informed by the Directorate 
of Legal Services at the MPS that he was a “person of interest” to Mr Mulcaire in that there 
was a piece of paper containing the words “John Prescott” and “Hull”, and two self-billing tax 
invoices dated 7 and 21 May 2006, addressed to News International Supply Company Limited 
and containing the words “Story – Other Prescott Assist – TXT” and “Story – Other Prescott 
Assist – TXT: Urgent”.577 He was not, however, alerted to the more concerning references to 
his adviser, her phone numbers and her pass codes, which had been discovered in the short 
space of time after Mr Mulcaire’s arrest but before his interview. Mr Yates attributed the 
failure to indexing problems on the HOLMES database:578

“I think what happened, and I say – and I’ve absolutely stated this in my statement 
and  accepted  it,  that  there  was  an  indexing  issue  around  the  name  John  Prescott 
being linked to his – I think it was his adviser, whose name I would never have known 
or could never – I don’t think anyone could have made the link, to be honest …”

8.194  This is not, however, the complete answer. In his evidence, Mr Yates stressed with some force 
that he checked on a number of occasions whether there was evidence that Lord Prescott had 
been a victim and that he always received the same answer, upon which he understandably 
relied579. He emphasised:580

“… I cannot tell you the amount of times I checked and sought further and better 
particulars about the possibility that Mr Prescott’s phone had been interfered with. It 
would be literally scores – over the following months ...”

He continued:581

“… Because I was so concerned, the idea of misleading the Deputy Prime Minister is 
not something I’d relish and I was absolutely desperate to get to the bottom if there 
was something there.”

8.195  DCS Williams has said that he briefed Mr Yates to the best of his ability; that he does not 
believe that all the material came to light until it had been scanned onto the HOLMES system 
some months later; and that he ensured that he showed Mr Yates all the material as it became 
available, including references to Tracey Temple. For the reasons explained above, I make no 
finding as to precisely what was brought to the attention of Mr Yates but, to say the very 
least, it is disappointing that what was inferred by the interviewing detectives within hours 
of the material being seized was not more clearly communicated to Mr Yates as he was being 
pressed by the Deputy Prime Minister.

The PCC response

8.196  Although this will be discussed later in this Report, as part of this narrative, it is worth including 

the response of the PCC. On 9 July 2009 the following statement was issued:

577 R (Bryant, Montague, Paddick and Prescott) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2011] EWHC 1314 (Admin)
578 p68, lines 5-10, John Yates, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Transcript-of-
Afternoon-Hearing-1-March-20122.pdf
579 This is probably because DCS Williams did not consider that the possible targeting of Lord Prescott’s staff 
constituted sufficient indication that he was a potential victim although it is difficult to understand why he would reach 
that conclusion because the link to Lord Prescott’s staff had been made: para 8.89 above.

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“The  PCC  has  previously  made  clear  that  it  finds  the  practice  of  phone  message 
tapping deplorable. Any suggestion that further transgressions have occurred since 
its report was published in 2007 will be investigated without delay. In the meantime, 
the PCC is contacting the Guardian newspaper and Information Commissioner for any 
further specific information in relation to the claims, published today about the older 
cases, which suggest the Commission has been misled at any stage of its inquiries into 
these matters.”

8.197  The  PCC  was  concerned  about  two  issues:  whether  it  had  been  misled  during  its  2007 
inquiry and whether its recommendations to the industry to help prevent any repetition of 
the criminal activity had failed. It launched a further investigation, taking evidence from the 
NoTW, the Guardian and the Information Commissioner’s Office.582

8.198  On  27  July  2009  the  PCC  wrote  to  Mr  Myler  asking  a  number  of  questions,  including  the 

following:583

“Does  it  remain  your  position  that  the  illegal  behaviour  of  Clive  Goodman  was  a 
rogue exception and that no other journalists or executives of the newspaper were 
aware of the practice of phone message tapping by anyone employed by the paper?”

8.199  In his letter of response dated 5 August 2009 Mr Myler stated that the allegations in the 
Guardian  were  “not  just  unsubstantiated  and  irresponsible,  they  were  wholly  false.”584  In 
response to the particular question quoted in the paragraph above he said:585

“Our internal enquiries have found no evidence of involvement by News of the World 
staff other than Clive Goodman in phone message interception beyond the e-mail 
transcript  which  emerged  in  April  2008  during  the  Gordon  Taylor  litigation  and 
which has since been revealed in the original Guardian report. That email was dated 
June 29 2005 and consisted of a transcript of voicemails from the phone of Gordon 
Taylor and another person which had apparently been recorded by Glenn Mulcaire. 
The email and transcript were created by a junior reporter (who has since left the 
newspaper). When questioned after the email was supplied to us by Gordon Taylor’s 
lawyers in April 2008, the junior reporter accepted that he had created the relevant 
email document but had no recollection of it beyond that. Since by the end of June 
2005 he had been a reporter for only a week or so (having been promoted ‘off the 
floor’ where he had been a messenger) and since the first months of his reporting 
career consisted largely of transcribing tapes for other people, his lack of recollection 
when questioned three years later is perhaps understandable.
“Email searches of relevant people … failed to show any trace of the email being sent 
to or received by any other News of the World staff member.
“Those who might have been connected to the relevant story … denied ever having 
seen or knowing about the relevant email and no evidence has been found which 
contradicts these assertions”.

8.200  Mr  Myler  was  asked  during  his  evidence  whether  his  internal  enquiries  had  in  fact 
demonstrated that the allegation made by the Guardian that there had been hacking into

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEthousands of mobile phones was unsubstantiated and irresponsible. He was asked to put to 
one side what the police might or might not have found. Mr Myler responded as follows:586

“I  didn’t  have  any  direct  information  that  our  internal  enquiries  had  gone  to  that 
point, and  as  I  said  earlier, one  of  the things  that  weighed  heavily  with  me when 
I came in was the fact that the police hadn’t interviewed anybody else other than 
Goodman in their enquiries.”

8.201  To  the  suggestion  that,  when  making  this  assertion  to  the  PCC,  he  had  not  relied  on  any 

information that he had obtained through internal enquiries Mr Myler said:

“Other than the appeal that Mr Goodman – I had to conduct with the head of human 
resources and the allegations that he made, and then talking to those individuals 
who he made allegations against. There was no evidence provided to me to support 
what the Guardian had said at all.”

8.202  It was put to Mr Myler that his evidence had been that after June 2008 he no longer believed 
the single rogue reporter defence (on the basis that it was untenable after the “for Neville” 
email was discovered) but that in this letter to the PCC he was effectively stating that there 
was  no  evidence  which  went  beyond  Mr  Goodman  and  therefore  that  the  single  rogue 
reporter defence was true. He said:

“Well,  the  rogue  reporter  defence  failed  to  hold  once  the  ‘for  Neville’  email  was 
discovered. And I made that clear to the Select Committee I think in July of 2009, I 
think it was, about its significance…
“But – yes, and that clearly, perhaps, was an error, because this letter was dated 5 
August and I’d appeared before the Select Committee in the month previously. So I’m 
sure that the PCC were aware of that, if that – clearly that was following my evidence 
to the Select Committee, which was very heavily covered.”

8.203  I am afraid that I find this response was unconvincing. It is not and cannot be acceptable for 
Mr Myler to rely on the evidence he gave to the Select Committee to support the proposition 
that the PCC would not have been misled by an entirely contradictory assertion that was 
contained in his response to them. On any showing, what he said to the PCC was neither full 
nor frank.

8.204  In addition, Mr Myler told the PCC that the process of internal investigation had been rigorous 
and  that  News  Group  had  instructed  Burton  Copeland,  an  independent  firm  of  solicitors, 
to deal with further police inquiries after the arrests of Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman. He 
claimed that Burton Copeland were given: 587

“every financial document which could possibly be relevant to the paper’s dealings 
with  Mulcaire,  and  they  confirmed  that  ‘they  could  find  no  evidence  from  these 
documents or their other enquiries which suggested complicity by the News of the 
World or other members of its staff beyond Clive Goodman in criminal activities’.”

8.205  This is the most that the Inquiry has been told about the work carried out by Burton Copeland 
given that NI has not waived legal professional privilege. As referred to588 there is no available 
information about what documents were given to Burton Copeland (beyond certain limited

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Efinancial documentation); what sources of information they were able to access; the precise 
terms of their instruction; what investigations they made; or what, if any, caveats surrounded 
their conclusions. As a result, the reliance by Mr Myler on their work is hardly persuasive.

8.206  Among its conclusions, the PCC found as follows:589

“…While  people  may  speculate  about  the  email  referencing  ‘Neville’,  the  Taylor 
settlement, and the termination payments to Mulcaire and Goodman, the PCC can 
only deal with the facts that are available rather than make assumptions. The PCC 
has seen no new evidence to suggest that the practice of phone message tapping was 
undertaken by others beyond Goodman and Mulcaire, or evidence that News of the 
World executives knew about Goodman and Mulcaire’s activities. It follows that there 
is nothing to suggest that the PCC was materially misled during its 2007 inquiry.”

The CMS Committee reaction

8.207  The CMS Committee considered that the Guardian article cast doubt on the evidence they had 
been given by NI executives in 2007 and so reopened the hearings in the inquiry (launched in 
November 2008) into press standards, privacy and libel; the purpose was to examine whether 
there  was  any  evidence  of  a  widespread  conspiracy  at  the  NoTW.  The  Committee  heard 
evidence  from  representatives  of  the  Guardian,  the  PCC,  the  Information  Commissioner 
and the MPS as well as from then current and former NI executives. It also received written 
evidence from the DPP and Mark Lewis, the solicitor who acted for Gordon Taylor. The NI 
witnesses comprised Tom Crone, Colin Myler, Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner and Les Hinton. 
The Committee also invited Glenn Mulcaire, Clive Goodman, Neville Thurlbeck and Rebecca 
Brooks to give evidence but all declined (save for Mr Thurlbeck who was prepared to give 
evidence but only in private). The Committee decided not to use its powers of compulsion for 
reasons of “time and practicality”.590

8.208  In giving evidence to the Committee, NI witnesses continued to assert that Mr Goodman had 

acted alone. Mr Hinton told the Committee:591

“There was never any evidence delivered to me that suggested that the conduct of 
Clive Goodman spread beyond him.”

8.209  In  response  to  questions  suggesting  that  termination  payments  to  Mr  Mulcaire  and  Mr 
Goodman could be interpreted as an attempt to prevent them speaking out about practices 
at the newspaper, Mr Hinton said he had authorised the payments on the advice of specialist 
employment lawyers.

8.210  Mr Coulson told the Committee that during his time as editor he “never condoned the use of 
phone hacking” and that he did not have “any recollection of incidences where phone hacking 
took place”.592 He said: 593

“What we had with the Clive Goodman case was a reporter who deceived the managing 
editor’s office and, in turn, deceived me. I have thought long and hard about this (I 
did when I left): what could I have done to have stopped this from happening? But if

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEa rogue reporter decides to behave in that fashion I am not sure that there is an awful 
lot more I could have done.”

When asked whether he commissioned an enquiry when he found out about the arrests, Mr 
Coulson said:594

“Yes. Obviously we wanted to know internally very quickly what the hell had gone on. 
Then I brought in Burton Copeland, an independent firm of solicitors to carry out an 
investigation. We opened up the files as much as we could. There was nothing that 
they asked for that they were not given.”

8.211  Mr Coulson did concede that Burton Copeland were tasked “with the primary purpose, I have 

to say, of trying to find out what happened in relation to Clive”.595

8.212  On the remit of the internal investigations Mr Myler said:596

“My recollection was that a very thorough investigation took place where there was 
a review of everything from how cash payments were processed …”

When asked about the width of the internal enquiry Mr Crone gave the following account:597

“… By the time I got back, which must have been August 15, Burton Copeland were in 
the office virtually every day or in contact with the office every day. My understanding 
of their remit was that they were brought in to go over everything and find out what 
had gone on, to liaise with the police … What I think was being enquired into was 
what had gone on leading to the arrests; what, in the relationship with Mulcaire, did 
we have to worry about. Burton Copeland came in; they were given absolutely free-
range to ask whatever they wanted to ask. They did risk accounts and they have got 
four lever-arch files of payment records, everything to do with Mulcaire, and there is 
no evidence of anything going beyond in terms of knowledge into other activities.”

8.213  Again, these assertions cannot be tested because legal professional privilege has not been 
waived in relation to the instructions given to Burton Copeland, the material provided, or, 
indeed, any aspect of the work done. I do no more than record what Mr Crone said.

8.214  The Committee concluded, in their report published on 24 February 2010, that:598

“Evidence we have seen makes it inconceivable that no-one else at the News of the 
World, bar Clive Goodman, knew about the phone-hacking … We cannot believe that 
the newspaper’s newsroom was so out of control for this to be the case.”

8.215  The  Committee  also  noted  that  the  newspaper’s  enquiries  had  been  far  from  “full”  or 
“vigorous”, as it – and the PCC – had been assured. It was struck by the “collective amnesia 
afflicting witnesses from the News of the World”.599 It concluded that:600

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“a culture undoubtedly did exist it the newsroom of the News of the World and other 
newspapers at the time which at best turned a blind eye to illegal activities such as 
phone-hacking and blagging and at worst actively condoned it …”

8.216  The determination of NI to maintain a line that the editor and the legal director believed was 
not true in the face of two investigations by the CMS Committee and two investigations by 
the PCC is extraordinary and, at the very least, a demonstration of loyalty to the NoTW and 
its reputation which says a great deal about the culture of the paper (to say nothing of its 
practices and its approach to ethical propriety). In fact, the NoTW maintained the “one rogue 
reporter” defence until the Spring of 2011 when three NoTW journalists were arrested as 
part of Operation Weeting.

8.217  The  Committee  also  considered  the  actions  of  the  MPS.  On  2  September  2009,  Mr  Yates 
and DCS Williams gave evidence to the CMS Committee. Mr Yates told the Committee that 
the  approach  during  the  investigation  had  been  that  an  offence  under  s1  RIPA  2000  was 
committed only where the messages intercepted had not previously been listened to by the 
intended recipient. He said:601

“Our job, as ever, is to follow the evidence and to make considered decisions based 
upon  our  experience  which  ensures  limited  resources  are  used  both  wisely  and 
effectively and, supported by senior counsel, including the DPP, the collective belief is 
that there were then and there remain now insufficient grounds or evidence to arrest 
or interview anyone else and, as I have said already, no additional evidence has come 
to light since.”

8.218  Mr Yates described his July 2009 review in the following terms:602

“… I considered the approach adopted by the prosecution team in their papers, what 
were they actually focused on, and it was those eight cases. I considered the amount 
of complexities and challenges around the evidence then and what evidence would 
be available now, particular in relation to the availability of the data. I considered the 
level of disclosure and who would review the material. In this case senior counsel had 
reviewed the material. I considered how the case was opened after the guilty pleas. 
I considered whether there was anything new in the Guardian articles in terms of 
additional evidence, and I considered finally our approach to the victims, how they 
were managed and dealt with and the impact of further inquiries, if they had been 
necessary, on them, and I came to the view, and I appreciate you all thought it was 
rather quick, that there was no new evidence in this case. It was a conflation of three 
old stories.”

8.219  He said of the Guardian article that:

“there  is  essentially  nothing  new  in  the  story  other  than  to  place  in  the  public 
domain additional material which had already been considered by both the police 
investigation into Goodman and Mulcaire and by the CPS and the prosecution team. 
There was certainly no new evidence and, in spite of a huge amount of publicity and 
our own request of the Guardian and others to submit to us any additional evidence, 
nothing has been forthcoming since.”

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE8.220  A key conclusion of the Committee was that the police had been wrong not to investigate 
further the contract or the “for Neville” email and that the reasons given on behalf of the 
MPS were not adequate:603

“In  2006  the  Metropolitan  Police  made  a  considered  choice,  based  on  available 
resources,  not  to  investigate  either  the  holding  contract  between  Greg  Miskiw 
and Glenn Mulcaire, or the ‘for Neville’ email. We have been told that choice was 
endorsed by the CPS. Nevertheless it is our view that the decision was a wrong one. 
The email was a strong indication both of additional lawbreaking and of the possible 
involvement of others. These matters merited thorough police investigation, and the 
first steps to be taken seem to us to have been obvious. The Metropolitan Police’s 
reasons for not doing so seem to us to be inadequate.”

8.221  As regard the PCC, the Committee found as follows:604

“We accept that in 2007 the PCC acted in good faith to follow up the implications of the 
convictions of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian’s fresh revelations 
in July 2009, however, provided good reason for the PCC to be more assertive in its 
enquiries, rather than accepting submissions from the News of the World once again 
at face value. This Committee has not done so and we find the conclusions in the PCC’s 
November report simplistic and surprising. It has certainly not fully, or forensically, 
considered all the evidence to this inquiry.”

9.	 September	2010:	The	New	York	Times
9.1 

On 1 September 2010 the New York Times published an article entitled “Tabloid Hack Attack 
on Royals, and Beyond”.605 The article reported that, in the summer of 2010, five people had 
issued claims alleging that the NoTW had been intercepting their voicemail messages; it also 
referred to the judicial review of the handling by the MPS of the investigation. The article 
claimed that:

“The  litigation  is  beginning  to  expose  just  how  far  the  hacking  went,  something 
that Scotland Yard did not do. In fact, an examination based on police records, court 
documents  and  interviews  with  investigators  and  reporters  show  that  Britain’s 
revered  police  agency  failed  to  pursue  leads  suggesting  that  one  of  the  country’s 
most powerful newspapers was routinely listening in on its citizens.
“The  police  had  seized  files  from  Mulcaire’s  home  in  2006  that  contained  several 
thousand mobile phone numbers of potential hacking victims and 91 mobile phone 
PIN codes. Scotland Yard even had a recording of Mulcaire walking one journalist – 
who may have worked at yet another tabloid – step by step through the hacking of a 
soccer official’s voice mail, according to a copy of the tape. But Scotland Yard focused 
almost exclusively on the royals case, which culminated with the imprisonment of 
Mulcaire  and  Goodman.  When  police  officials  presented  evidence  to  prosecutors, 
they didn’t discuss crucial clues that the two men may not have been alone in hacking 
the voice mail messages of story targets.”

9.2 

The article also reported that “several investigators” had said in interviews that the MPS was 
reluctant to conduct a wider inquiry in part because of its close relationship with the NoTW.

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid EIt reported that during interviews with more than a dozen reporters and editors at the NoTW 
claims were made that voicemail interception was “an industry-wide thing”, that “Every hack 
on every newspaper knew this was done” and that it was pervasive at the NoTW. The article 
alleged that illicit methods of obtaining confidential information were known as “the dark 
arts”. The article also made the following allegations:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

That in the documents seized from Mr Mulcaire there were at least three names of 
other NoTW journalists.
That the MPS had a symbiotic relationship with the NoTW: “The police sometimes built 
high-profile cases out of the paper’s exclusives, and News of the World reciprocated 
with fawning stories of arrests”.
The MPS detectives had faced pressure from within their own organisation and were 
reminded of the “long-term relationship with News International”.
The  MPS  did  not  discuss  certain  evidence  with  the  CPS,  including  the  notes  which 
suggested the involvement of other reporters.

(e)  By  “sitting  on”  the  evidence  for  so  long,  the  MPS  had  made  it  impossible  to  get 

(f) 

information from phone companies, which do not keep records indefinitely.
By only notifying a small proportion of those whose phones may have been illegally 
accessed,  the  MPS  had  effectively  shielded  the  NoTW  from  a  large  number  of  civil 
actions.

On 3 September 2010 one of the reporters quoted in the New York Times article, Sean Hoare, 
was interviewed on BBC Radio 4. He repeated the expression “the dark arts” and said that 
“phone hacking” was endemic in the industry. He made clear allegations which, in order to 
avoid prejudice to the ongoing investigation, are not repeated here.

Given  the  resurgence  of  the  allegations  and  the  additional  detail  provided  by  the  New 
York  Times  and  Mr  Hoare,  Mr  Yates  should  have  reflected  carefully  on  the  exercise  that 
he  conducted  in  2009  and  reviewed,  in  more  depth,  what  evidence  was  gathered  during 
Operation Caryatid and what it might show. Once again, however, he failed to engage with 
the substance of what was alleged. He did not, as he should have done, revert to DCS Williams 
and DCS Surtees and ask them for full details of what the “crucial clues” or leads might be that 
indicated that Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire were not acting alone or ask them to explain 
fully what indications there might be that the three named journalists had been involved in 
the conspiracy. It is quite clear that having made the dogmatic and over-hasty decision on 9 
July 2009, he then failed to assess anything that might conceivably challenge the correctness 
of his initial decision with anything approaching an open mind. It remained the case that 
Mr Yates was not prepared to entertain the possibility that there was anything in the vast 
quantity of documentation held by the police, that had not been analysed, that could itself 
generate lines of enquiry; he was interested only in the question of whether the New York 
Times could itself produce evidence.

9.3 

9.4 

9.5 

On 5 September 2010 Mr Yates issued a press statement which included the following:606

“The New York Times contacted the MPS about their investigation. Our stance remains 
as before. We have repeatedly asked them for any new material that they have for 
us to consider. We were never made aware of the material from Sean Hoare before 
the article’s publication. We have sought additional information from them and will

402

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEconsider this material, along with Sean Hoare’s recent BBC Radio interview, and will 
consult the CPS on how best to progress it.”

9.6  Mr Yates also took the opportunity to re-state the lack of evidence that Lord Prescott had 

been a victim:

“Separately, we are aware of the current claims in the media from, amongst others, 
Lord Prescott about his view that his phone was hacked. There remains to this day no 
evidence that his phone was hacked by either Mulcaire or Goodman. This is a matter 
of public record.”

9.7 

On 6 September 2010 Mr Yates chaired a Gold Group meeting. Neither DCS Williams nor DCS 
Surtees were invited to the meeting. The terms of reference for the Gold Group607 were stated 
to be: “To provide ACPO oversight of the various MPS strands relating to ‘phone hacking’”. 
The strands were listed and included “New information in the public domain by ex News of 
the  World  employees,  which  relates  to  Andy  Coulson,  Sean  Hoare,  Sharon  Marshall,  Ross 
Hall, Brendan Montague and Paul McMullan” and “New allegations or new material as yet 
unknown”. The summary of the minutes of the meeting on 6 September 2010 stated that:608

“JY explained that the purpose of the actions required was to seek clarity as to whether 
there was any new evidence amongst the recent media reporting before making any 
further decision. This is not, at this stage, a further investigation. DSupt Haydon (as 
ACSO’s former Staff Officer) will lead this separate and independent effort to clarify 
the above.”

9.8 

Action points required Detective Superintendent Haydon (who had been appointed SIO) to 
review the transcripts of different statements in the public domain, liaise with the CPS to 
discuss any new material that might come to light and consider interviewing Sharon Marshall 
about  the  statements  made  in  her  book.  There  was  also  an  action  point  for  Mr  Yates  to 
consult  the  DPP  or  an  appropriate  deputy.  Late  in  the  evening  of  6  September  2010,  Mr 
Yates made contact with the CPS. According to the Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, to 
whom he spoke, Mr Yates said that he wanted to update Mr Starmer and let him know that 
he (Mr Yates) did not intend to reopen the investigation but merely to clarify what had been 
said in the New York Times article by inviting the journalists to provide their material and by 
interviewing Sean Hoare; thereafter, they might then seek the advice of the CPS.

9.9 

On 8 September 2010 D/Supt Haydon sent an email to the CPS setting out the action the MPS 
was proposing to take following the article. In his email he said that he had been asked:609

“to clarify the new information in the public domain (since 1st September 2010) to 
establish if there is any new evidence in the phone hacking case … I wish to make it 
clear that I am not reinvestigating the original case so knowledge of the case and 
retrieving case papers is not necessary.”

9.10  On 9 September 2010, Mr Yates convened a Gold Group meeting to agree current actions.  
D/Supt Haydon was directed to define the terms of reference for the work being undertaken 
and extend the remit to cover additional individuals who were coming forward.610 The exercise, 
although stated not to be an investigation, was subsequently given the name Operation Varec 
and the following terms of reference:611

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“To assess whether allegations being made in the media since 1st September 2010 
provided  any  new  evidence  of  criminal  offences,  namely  unlawful  interception  of 
communications, at News of the World, in 2005/2006.”

9.11  At a meeting of the Gold Group on 10 September 2010, it was noted that the new witnesses, 
who had been identified by the New York Times article, would need to be approached as part 
of Operation Varec. D/Supt Haydon informed those present that the New York Times had 
been asked for their material.612

9.12  At around this time, D/Supt Haydon asked a HOLMES supervisor to carry out a search on 
the HOLMES database for evidence that Lord Prescott had been targeted by Mr Mulcaire. 
In an email dated 10 September 2010,613 he was informed by that supervisor that the name 
“John Prescott” appeared on p183 of seven notepads seized from Mr Mulcaire and that word 
“PREZA” appeared once in handwritten notes. The references to “JLP reset PIN 3333” and “JLP” 
were also brought to his attention but it was suggested to him that, given the surrounding 
information, they related to Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. He was also informed that there were 
no results for searches on popular media nick-names for Lord Prescott. It appears that Lord 
Prescott was not given this information, but it is right to repeat that, in December 2009, he 
had been informed that his name and other details appeared in the Mulcaire documents.

9.13  Reverting to the position of the CPS, following the publication of the New York Times article, 
Mr Starmer quickly took stock of what action he needed to take. Mr Starmer explained that:614

“Whilst respecting the views of David Perry QC and Louis Mably, I had in fact had 
concerns for some time about the emphatic view of the construction of sections 1 
and 2 of RIPA that had been articulated by Mr Perry QC in 2009 and adopted by me 
in my letters and evidence to the CMS committee. I therefore decided that it would 
be sensible to look again at the matter, particularly since it appeared that the CPS 
might be required to give the MPS advice in relation to the allegations in the New 
York Times.”

9.14 

In the result, Mr Starmer decided to commission two written advices: the first was to be from 
original counsel, who would be asked to consider the original papers and give a definitive 
view of the approach taken to s1 of RIPA in 2006 to 2007; the second advice was sought from 
fresh counsel, Mr Mark Heywood QC, who had had no previous connection to the case.

9.15  The DPP received the written advice from Mr Perry on 14 September 2010.615 Having this time 
had the opportunity to consider the papers, Mr Perry concluded that for purposes of the 2006 
prosecution it had not in fact been necessary to resolve the question of whether or not s1 of 
RIPA required proof that the interception had taken place before the intended recipient had 
accessed the message (given that Mr Mulcaire had pleaded guilty to the indictment). Having 
refreshed his memory from the papers, Mr Perry stated that the oral advice he gave in 2006 
had been that the proper construction of RIPA was a difficult issue, with tenable arguments 
either way; and that a narrow approach to the construction of RIPA had not limited the scope 
of the police investigation.

9.16  Upon  receipt  of  this  advice  Mr  Starmer  was  naturally  concerned  that  this  did  not  fully 
correspond with what he had been told in 2009, which itself had been the basis of his letters

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEand evidence to the CMS committee. Mr Perry was therefore instructed to advise to whether 
the “for Neville” email should now be viewed in a different way in the light of his more recent 
advice. On 16 September 2010, Mr Perry provided a note616 in which he confirmed that the 
construction of RIPA set out in his advice written 18 months earlier had been taken from the 
note drafted by DCS Williams. He also made it clear that his conclusions in relation to the “for 
Neville” email remained unchanged.

9.17  On 17 September 2010, the DPP received written advice from Mr Heywood.617 In a sustained 
and sophisticated analysis of the competing legal arguments, Mr Heywood inclined to the 
view that the broader construction of RIPA was to be preferred, having regard to the purpose 
underpinning  the  legislation  and  additional  materials  sent  to  him  by  First  Parliamentary 
Counsel. Mr Heywood added that, in any event, even if the narrow interpretation should turn 
out to be correct, it would make no difference to investigators, because the inchoate offences 
of conspiracy or attempt would be unaffected by a narrow construction of the legislation.

9.18 

In  his  subsequent  dealings  with  Parliamentary  Select  Committees,  Mr  Starmer  no  longer 
adhered to a narrow interpretation of RIPA: in essence, he indicated that the approach he 
intended  to  adopt  would  be  to  advise  the  police  and  CPS  prosecutors  to  proceed  on  the 
assumption that a court might adopt a wide interpretation of sections 1 and 2 of RIPA.

9.19  On 1 October 2010, D/Supt Haydon and another officer had a meeting with Simon Clements 
and Asker Hussain of the CPS. D/Supt Haydon provided a detailed update on the progress of 
Operation Varec.618

9.20  On 4 October 2010, The Dispatches programme, “Tabloids, Tories and Telephone Hacking”, 
reported  allegations  that  the  NoTW  had  been  involved  in  the  unlawful  interception  of 
voicemail messages. Following this programme, D/Supt Haydon wrote to Colin Myler asking 
him to provide relevant material including transcripts of telephone calls or emails that may 
be related to unlawful interception and a full list of the names of employees who worked on 
the ‘Features’ or ‘News’ desks for the period 2005 to 2006.619 Mr Myler replied on 13 October 
2010, stating:620

“I  am  aware  of  the  allegations  made  in  the  Dispatches  programme,  concerning 
telephone  voicemail  accessing  in  2005-2006.  However,  I  am  as  sure  as  I  can  be 
that  since  I  became  editor  of  the  News  of  the  World  in  January  2007  neither  the 
newspaper nor its staff have collected or obtained information by means of unlawful 
interception. Similarly, I am as sure as I can be that neither the newspaper nor its staff 
are in possession of such material whenever it may have originally been collected.”

9.21  He indicated that they were putting together a list of names which they would forward to 
him. That list was emailed by Tom Crone to the MPS.621 D/Supt Haydon then drafted a letter 
which Mr Crone circulated on his behalf, on 22 October 2010, to 19 members of staff.622 In 
that letter D/Supt Haydon explained that he was considering any new material that had come 
to light as a result of the Dispatches programme and said:623

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“I understand you were employed on either the News or Features desks during the 
relevant period – 2005/06. If you feel you are able to assist, and I stress this is in 
relation to the issue of ‘phone hacking’ only, then I request you make contact with me 
on the contact details provided in this letter.”

9.22  Meanwhile, at the CPS, it appears that Mr Starmer was frustrated that the matter was not 
going to be investigated. Mr Clements recorded in a note of a meeting on 19 October 2010 
that Mr Starmer said: “No one wants to reopen the investigation”.624 Mr Starmer explained in 
evidence that:625

“…  I  honestly  can’t  remember  what  I  said  at  that  meeting  but  I  obviously  said 
something.  Mr  Clements  does  remember  it  and  wrote  it  down  at  the  time  and 
thought I was frustrated because it appeared to me that others wouldn’t reopen the 
investigation.
“I’d had the meeting back in 2009 where a course of action I thought was reasonably 
sensible didn’t look as if it was going to find favour, and I’d been told in September 
2010 that whatever else was going to happen, this was not going to be reinvestigated. 
I think if I was expressing any frustration, it was probably borne of these two things.”

9.23  On  12  November  2010,  D/Supt  Haydon  submitted  to  the  CPS  an  “Advice  file”,  dated  10 
November 2010, which was a formal request for advice on issues arising from Operation Varec, 
including whether there was evidence to justify or support a re-opening or re-investigation 
of Operation Caryatid and the prospects of prosecuting any individuals. He stressed in the 
document that his task had not been to re-open or re-investigate the cases of Mr Goodman 
and Mr Mulcaire, but noted that there were links and crossovers with the prosecution. He set 
out details of the four phases of the investigation (or scoping exercise).

9.24  The first phase had been to ask the New York Times to provide any material in support of its 
article. The paper had refused the request, claiming journalistic privilege. It was also reported 
that:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

The police interviewed Sean Hoare under caution in the hope that they could convert 
his claims and admissions into evidence, but he made no comment.
The police interviewed Sharon Marshall, not under caution, but she did not disclose any 
new evidence.
The  police  approached  Paul  McMullan,  a  former  ‘features’  journalist  at  the  NoTW, 
on numerous occasions in order to interview him under caution, but he declined to 
cooperate.
The police interviewed Brendan Montague, a freelance journalist, not under caution 
and more as a victim, but he did not disclose any new evidence.
The police interviewed under caution Ross Hall, who had authored the “for Neville” 
email and that he had given an account of his employment at the NoTW as a runner in 
2005/6 but made no disclosures relating to voicemail interception.
The police interviewed Andy Coulson in the presence of his solicitor, who denied any 
involvement with or knowledge of phone hacking.

9.25  D/Supt Haydon noted that there were no communications data that would support a criminal 

investigation or prosecution.

406

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE9.26  During phase two the police approached Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire but both declined 
to assist the investigation. Neville Thurlbeck was interviewed under caution. Mr Thurlbeck 
produced a pre-prepared statement and denied knowledge of ever receiving the “for Neville” 
email. He also denied any involvement in voicemail interception and refused to answer any 
further questions. Greg Miskiw was interviewed under caution. He produced a pre-prepared 
statement  in  which  he  outlined  his  dealings  with  Mr  Mulcaire  but  refused  to  answer  any 
further questions. Matt Driscoll was interviewed. He was employed at the NoTW as a sports 
reporter but was dismissed in 2007 for supposed inaccurate reporting. He said in interview that 
he knew that voicemail interception was used as a technique but never used the technique 
himself and that it was not one used on the sports desk where he was employed. The police 
also sent letters to three supervisors employed by the NoTW who had been named in an 
anonymous letter. The police did not receive any responses to the letters.

9.27  During phase three, the police wrote to the Producer of the Dispatches programme “Tabloid, 
Tories and Telephone hacking”. In a letter to the MPS dated 22 October 2010, the Controller 
of legal and compliance for Channel 4 wrote:

“Having discussed the matter further with the producers who have direct dealings with 
the 13 individuals, they do not believe that any of the individuals would be prepared 
to  assist  your  investigation.  I  also  confirm  that  having  spoken  with  the  producers 
they  do  not  have  any  additional  evidence  that  was  not  included  in  the  broadcast 
programme that could assist the MPS and that is not already in the public domain.”

9.28  The  MPS  also  wrote  to  the  editor  of  the  Guardian,  the  Daily  Telegraph,  the  Independent 
and the NoTW seeking any new or additional material they held that could assist in the MPS 
investigation. No new material was forthcoming.

9.29  Finally,  phase  four  involved  writing  to  19  members  of  staff  still  employed  by  the  NoTW 
(paragraph  9.21  above  refers)  to  establish  if  any  could  assist  or  provide  any  information 
relating to voicemail interception. No response was received from any of them.

9.30  D/Supt Haydon then set out the following under the heading ‘Conclusion’:

“1.  Has  the  current  MPS  investigation  revealed  any  further  evidence  relating  to 
unlawful  interception  of  communications,  namely  mobile  telephone  voicemails, 
involving The News of the World?
“It is my view that there remains a vast amount of press and media coverage, claims 
and allegations but with no substantive ‘evidence’ in support. There is some possible 
circumstantial  evidence  but  in  the  absence  of  any  communications  data  and  any 
other supporting evidence, this cannot be progressed.
“I accept that the evidential position does not meet the threshold for a referral to the 
CPS but in view of the vast media, public and political scrutiny in this case and due 
to both the MPS and CPS involvement to date, I consider a referral is appropriate in 
order to agree a joint current and future position in this case …”

9.31  On 10 December 2010 Mr Clements advised on Operation Varec on behalf of the CPS.626 He 
concluded that the case did not pass the evidential stage of the test contained in the Code 
for Crown Prosecutors, namely that there must be sufficient evidence to establish that there 
is a realistic prospect of conviction. He added that he considered that the available evidence 
in fact fell “well below” the evidential threshold for prosecution. Given the on-going police 
investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to identify precisely what material had formed

407

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Epart of the papers submitted to the CPS or to consider any analysis of the underlying material. 
Mr Clements also stated in the advice document that:

“I  have  agreed  with  Detective  Superintendent  Haydon  that  in  the  future  if  any 
revelations come to the attention of the Metropolitan police that he considers could 
properly be said to constitute new and substantial evidence of offending that we will 
meet together as a panel and conduct a joint assessment of the material and decide 
whether further assessment or investigation is likely to provide evidence to support 
criminal proceedings.”

9.32  The DPP announced the conclusions reached by Mr Clements in a press statement that day.

9.33  Based on Operation Varec, Mr Yates has claimed that the issues raised by the New York Times 
article were properly scoped in collaboration with the CPS.627 I do not agree. What Mr Yates 
scoped was a consideration of the material that had been put in the public domain by the 
New York Times and the Dispatches programme which itself involved a number of requests 
and  interviews;  having  regard  to  the  circumstances,  it  is  not  surprising  that  these  were 
unrevealing. What he did not do was go back to the original allegation both in the Guardian 
and the New York Times, namely, that there was information in the documents seized from 
Mr Mulcaire which incriminated others at the NoTW. This was the reason for the allegation 
that was so potentially damaging to the MPS that it was engaged in a cover up. The answer 
to this allegation was straightforward: without deciding to re-open Operation Caryatid, look 
at the material to find out if there is anything in it which bears out what has been alleged.

10.	 December	2010:	The	Guardian	article	and	the	

aftermath

10.1  On 15 December 2010, the allegations were provided with a fresh impetus when the Guardian 
published allegations made by Sienna Miller in her civil claim against NGN and Mr Mulcaire. 
The  article,  entitled  “Phone  hacking  approved  by  top  News  of  the  World  executive  –  new 
files” reported that Particulars of Claim filed by Ms Miller alleged that the interception of 
voicemail messages on phones belonging to members of the Royal Household: “was part of a 
scheme commissioned by the [News of the World] and not simply the unauthorised work of its 
former royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, acting as a ‘rogue reporter’ as it [had] previously 
claimed.”

10.2  The Particulars of Claim were based upon documents disclosed to her legal advisers by the 
MPS following a disclosure application to the High Court. The Guardian article alleged that 
one of the documents disclosed implied that Mr Mulcaire had been instructed to intercept 
voicemail messages received by Ms Miller and also by her mother, her publicist, one of her 
closest friends, as well as Jude Law, her former partner, and his personal assistant. The article 
also reported that:

“The document, which has been released to the Guardian by the high court, suggests 
that the hacking of the two actors was part of a wider scheme, hatched early in 2005, 
when Mulcaire agreed to use ‘electronic intelligence and eavesdropping” to supply 
the paper with daily transcripts of the messages of a list of named targets from the 
worlds of politics, royalty and entertainment.”

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE“The  document  is  gravely  embarrassing  for  Scotland  Yard,  which  has  held  the 
information about the two actors in a large cache of evidence for more than four 
years and repeatedly failed to investigate it…
“The new evidence implies that the targeting of the royal household, which led to the 
original police inquiry, was specifically commissioned by the paper.
“In  or  about  January  2005  the  News  of  the  World  agreed  a  scheme  with  Glenn 
Mulcaire whereby he would, on their behalf, obtain information on individuals relating 
to the following: ‘political, royal and showbiz/entertainment’; and that he would use 
electronic intelligence and eavesdropping in order to obtain this information. He also 
agreed to provide daily transcripts.”

10.3  The  article  also  alleged  that  the  police  had  failed  to  interview  four  journalists  who  were 

implicated by the material already in police possession.

10.4  On 6 January 2011, the Guardian asked the CPS a series of detailed questions about whether 
or not the CPS had been aware, in 2006, of the evidence that was emerging from the civil 
action brought by Ms Miller. Mr Starmer explained, frankly, that these were not easy questions 
to answer given that there was no one to hand within the CPS who had first-hand knowledge 
of  the  investigation  and  prosecution  in  2006.  Having  said  that,  however,  Mr  Starmer  was 
becoming  increasingly  concerned  by  the  evidence  emerging  from  the  civil  claim  and  he 
decided that the time had come for a much fuller exercise. At that stage, what he wanted was 
an examination of all material available at that time, whether in the possession of the police 
or the CPS, and for some further assistance to be given to him about what consideration was 
given to it at the time. He explained: 628

“What then happened … was that as I understood it, some of the information that 
was emerging from the Sienna Miller civil action I was told had in fact been amongst 
the unused material. Now, this was the second time this had occurred. The first time 
was in relation to the Neville email, and now it was happening again in relation to the 
Sienna Miller material. And I’m afraid at that stage I thought nothing less than a root 
and branch review of all the material that we have and the police had is now going 
to satisfy me about this case. And that’s why I indicated in fact to Tim Godwin, who I 
think was then Acting Commissioner, that I had for my part reached the view that we 
could no longer approach this on a piecemeal basis looking at bits of material and we 
really had to roll our sleeves up and look at everything.”

10.5 

In that context, a meeting took place on Friday 14 January 2011 attended by Mr Starmer, 
Mr Yates and various other officials and police officers. Mr Starmer opened the meeting by 
stating that in view of recent events the time may well have come to reconsider everything 
that is or was available thereby enabling the CPS, if asked, to give comprehensive answers 
to  current  and  future  questions.  The  immediate  riposte  of  Mr  Yates  was  to  assert  that  if 
new evidence were available he would examine it but that he did not believe this to be the 
position. The following appeared in notes of the meeting:629

“DH [a police officer]: Op Varec is the only new material in terms of G/M. There is 
nothing new – all the stuff is on the system.
“JY: puts both organisations in difficult position: what did we do in 2009?

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E“DPP: looked at G/M and the decisions made and whether they were correct. This is 
a broader examination to go before panel (2006 and subsequent).”

10.6 

In answer to the question whether the mood of the meeting was “all sweetness and light”, 
Mr Starmer stated the following in evidence: 630

“I was absolutely clear in my mind at the beginning of that meeting I was going to 
settle for nothing less than a full review of all this material unless somebody blocked 
me access to it, and I approached it in that way. To be fair to Mr Yates, who did not 
seek to block that approach, and in the end agreed to it, but I have to say but by then 
I had reached the stage where I really was not in the mood for being dissuaded from 
my then course of action, I am afraid.”

10.7  Mr Starmer also said that Mr Yates had a number of concerns about how the review would 
be handled, but did not resist his proposal  that there be a root and branch review.631 Mr 
Starmer highlighted that Mr Yates was keen that the MPS should request the review rather 
than having it imposed on them. They therefore agreed that Mr Yates would formally invite 
the DPP to conduct a review. After the meeting Mr Starmer decided that his Principal Legal 
Adviser, Ms Alison Levitt QC, should carry it out.

10.8  The account given by Mr Yates of this meeting had a different emphasis, and suggested that 
he was, indeed, concerned about how matters had been dealt with and did not simply adopt 
a refrain that he would act if there were new evidence. He stated as follows in his witness 
statement:632

“In early January 2011, my level of concern as to how matters had been dealt with to 
date caused me to formally request the DPP to undertake a review of all the material 
in police possession. This he agreed to do and he tasked Alison Levitt, QC to undertake 
this task on his behalf.”

10.9 

It should be noted that Mr Yates was not questioned about this meeting or asked if he agreed 
that he said that both organisations had been put in a difficult position, and if so, what he 
meant by it.

10.10  That same day Mr Yates wrote to the DPP in the following terms, acknowledging, apparently 
for the first time, the possibility that there might be evidence in the existing material which 
would warrant further investigation:633

“We are both aware that there remain outstanding public, legal and political concerns. 
This is particularly so in relation to the various and recently reported high profile civil 
cases …
“As a result, I consider it would be wise to invite you to further re-examine all the 
material collected in this matter. This would also enable you to advise me and assure 
yourself as to whether there is any existing material which could now form evidence 
in any future criminal prosecution relating to phone hacking.”

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE10.11  Also on 14 January 2011 the CPS and the MPS issued a joint press statement to that effect.634

10.12  On  26  January  2011,  NI  provided  the  MPS  with  significant  new  information  relating  to 
allegations of voicemail interception at the NoTW in 2005 to 2006, which had apparently 
been discovered whilst NI was dealing with requests for disclosure in the civil actions. NI had 
found three key emails implicating an employee other than Mr Goodman. That same day the 
MPS announced that it was re-opening its investigation into allegations of unlawful voicemail 
interception at the NoTW. Mr Yates claimed that it was this new evidence that brought about 
his decision to reopen the investigation.635

10.13  Once  NI  decided  to  cooperate, the  evidential  flood  gates  opened,  providing  material  that 
had not been made available to the police by Burton Copeland. I can only repeat that it is 
impossible to ascertain to what material Burton Copeland had access or what advice they 
provided.

10.14  To  complete  the  chronology,  on  4  July  2011,  the  Guardian  reported  that  the  NoTW  had 
“hacked” the mobile phone belonging to Milly Dowler. On 7 July 2011 the final edition of the 
NoTW was published, with the editorial admitting:

“Quite simply, we lost our way … Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is 
truly sorry.”

10.15  On 17 July 2011, for reasons not connected with this investigation but in the light of further 
allegations relating to his conduct,636 Sir Paul Stephenson resigned and, on 18 July 2011, Mr 
Yates also resigned.637

10.16  On 20 July 2011 the Home Affairs Committee published its report: “Unauthorised tapping 
into or hacking of mobile communications”. The Committee expressed the following view of 
the exercise conducted by Mr Yates:638

“Although what Mr Yates was tasked to do was not a review in the proper police use 
of the term, the public was allowed to form the impression that the material seized 
from  Mr  Mulcaire  in  2006  was  being  re-examined  to  identify  any  other  potential 
victims  and  perpetrators.  Instead,  the  process  was  more  in  the  nature  of  a  check 
as to whether a narrowly-defined inquiry had been done properly and whether any 
new information was sufficient to lead to that inquiry being re-opened or a new one 
instigated. It is clear that the officers consulted about the earlier investigation were 
not asked the right questions, otherwise we assume it would have been obvious that 
there  was  the  potential  to  identify  far  more  possible  perpetrators  in  the  material 
seized from Mr Mulcaire ...”

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E11.	 The	past	unravels

The civil proceedings before Vos J and the disclosure process

11.1  The  civil  litigation  has  attracted  extensive  public  interest  and  attention.  It  has  also  had 
wider consequences beyond the confines of the claims for damages themselves. In order to 
understand the full extent of the interception, recording and use of their voicemail messages, 
so that they could properly present their claims, the claimants made disclosure applications 
which required NGN and the MPS639 to disclose various documents.

11.2  By way of example, on 6 December 2010 Vos J ordered the MPS to disclose the following 

classes of documents to Skylet Andrew:640

(a) 

Telephone  records  used  by  Mr  Muclaire  relating  to  the  accessing  of  Mr  Andrew’s 
voicemail messages.

(b)  Documents  evidencing  communications  between  Mr  Mulcaire  and  another  person 
concerning  the  interception  activities  of  Mr  Mulcaire  in  relation  to  Mr  Andrew’s 
voicemail messages.

(c)  Documents evidencing communications between Mr Mulcaire and employees of NGN 

concerning information about Mr Andrew.

(d)  Documents concerning payments for information made by NGN to Mr Mulcaire.
(e) 
(f)  Documents found during the MPS investigation referring to Mr Andrew or his mobile 

Transcripts of Mr Andrew’s voicemail messages obtained from Mr Mulcaire.

phone.

11.3  On 17 January 2011, Mr Mulcaire provided information to Mr Andrew indicating that he had 
supplied information from voicemail messages belonging to Mr Andrew to the news desk at 
the NoTW, identifying the name of the person whom he alleged had asked him to intercept 
the voicemail messages.

11.4  As a further example, on 20 July 2011, Hugh Grant and Jemima Khan obtained an order, with 
the consent of the MPS, for the disclosure of documents concerning the voicemail messages 
allegedly intercepted by Mr Mulcaire and forming the subject of newspaper articles about 
them in the NoTW and other newspapers.

11.5  As a result of the claim brought by Lord Prescott, the following statement entered the public 

domain,641 on 19 January 2012:

“On 3 December 2011 [NGN] admitted a list of matters including that it had entered 
into an agreement with [Mr Mulcaire] and paid him hundreds of thousands of pounds 
to  obtain  information  about  specific  individuals  for  use  by  the  News  of  the  World 
journalists and publication in the newspaper. It is admitted that certain of its employees 
were aware of, sanctioned and requested the methods used by [Mr Mulcaire] which 
included the unlawful interception of mobile phone messages and obtaining call and

641 Admissions made by NGN for the purposes of civil litigation may be relevant in relation to a general consideration 
of the practices of the press but do not constitute any form of admission on behalf of any individual employee and 
cannot be assumed to be directed to any individual employee

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEtext data (which methods are known as “phone hacking”; obtaining information by 
“blagging”: and, in one case, unlawfully accessing emails). It is also admitted that 
[Mr Mulcaire] had provided journalists at The News of the World with information 
to  enable  the  said  journalists  themselves  to  intercept  voicemail  messages,  [NGN] 
accepted that some information unlawfully obtained by [Mr Mulcaire] was used to 
enable  private  investigators  employed  by  the  News  of  the  World,  including  Derek 
Webb, to monitor, locate and track individuals and place them under surveillance.”

11.6  By January 2012, a large number of claims had been settled. NGN consented to the assessment 
of  aggravated  damages  on  the  basis  that  there  were  those  at  NGN  who  knew  about  its 
wrongdoing and sought to conceal it by putting out public statements they knew to be false, 
deliberately failing to provide the police with all facts of which they were aware, deliberately 
deceiving the police in respect of the purpose of payments to Mr Mulcaire and destroying 
evidence of wrongdoing.642

The judicial review of the actions of the MPS

11.7  The July 2009 Guardian article prompted a number of individuals to question whether their 
voicemail messages had been intercepted. Four such individuals were Chris Bryant, MP for 
the Rhondda, Brendan Montague, Brian Paddick and Lord Prescott. All four contacted the 
MPS asking whether this was the case.

11.8  Mr  Bryant  was  informed  that  his  name  and  telephone  number  appeared  in  the  material 
retrieved during the investigation. Mr Bryant said that the information provided was “vague 
and  incomplete”.  By  letter  dated  25  February  2010,  he  requested  further  details  having 
received information from his service provider to the effect that, in about December 2003, 
there had been three unlawful attempts to intercept his communications. He said that he 
was told by the MPS “informally in a telephone conversation that he would not be given any 
further information without a court order.”643

11.9  Mr  Paddick  was  told  that  there  was  no  information  to  suggest  that  he  had  been  subject 
to unlawful monitoring or interception of his telephone. His solicitors enquired again and 
the MPS then reported that, in fact, his name and occupation did appear in the documents 
obtained during the investigation.

11.10  As  regards  Lord  Prescott,  as  set  out  above,  initially,  Mr  Yates  personally  assured  him  that 
there was no evidence to suggest that his voicemail messages had been intercepted; he was 
not told about the references to his adviser and her telephone numbers and pass codes. The 
first intimation that this was not the case came in December 2009.

11.11  So far as Mr Montague was concerned, there was no evidence at the time the proceedings 
were instituted that his name appeared in the documentary material recovered during the 
investigation.  His  concerns  were  generalised,  rather  than  being  based  upon  any  specific 
incident  or  report.  Ultimately,  he  did  not  dispute  that  no  evidence  had  emerged  that  his 
name or details featured in any of the materials seized from Mr Mulcaire in 2006.

11.12  The claim for judicial review was issued on or around 14 September 2010. Lord Prescott was 
added to the proceedings in November 2010. The claimants challenged the decisions of the 
MPS as to the scope of Operation Caryatid and the decision not to inform every person whose 
voicemail messages had or may have been intercepted that this had or may have occurred.

413

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E11.13  On 9 February 2011, the Directorate of Legal Services at the MPS wrote to Lord Prescott and 
informed him that in “recent material supplied … by News International” there was an email 
(from an email address associated with Mr Mulcaire) dated 28 April 2006 which appeared to 
contain the details of the mobile telephone number and PIN number of the adviser to Lord 
Prescott and that there was reference to 45 messages.

11.14  On 10 March 2011, Mr Bryant was shown facing pages in a notebook seized from Mr Mulcaire 
which contained telephone numbers which would have dialled his phone and very probably 
left voicemails messages, various addresses where he has lived, the names of his partners, his 
constituency, his home telephone numbers and other personal information.

11.15  On 15 March 2011, Mr Paddick was shown three documents obtained by the police in 2006. 
The information included his police mobile phone number, the mobile phone number of his 
then partner and his former partner, the addresses and telephone numbers of numerous 
other associates, his own landline number and landline numbers of others. There was also a 
print out from the electronic records held by Mr Mulcaire which described Mr Paddick as a 
“project”.

11.16  On 23 May 2011 the application for permission to proceed with a claim by way of judicial 
review  came  before  the  Administrative  Court.644  Mr  Justice  Foskett  considered  the  facts 
set out above and decided that in relation to the cases of Mr Bryant, Mr Paddick and Lord 
Prescott, each raised a claim worthy of consideration at a full hearing.645 Ultimately the claim 
for judicial review was compromised, with admissions being made by the MPS. The following 
declaration was agreed between the parties:

“In breach of its duties under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 
in  circumstances  where  the  interference  with  the  individuals’  right  to  respect  for 
their private lives may have amounted to the commission of a criminal offence, the 
defendant failed to take prompt, reasonable and proportionate steps to ensure that 
those identified as potential victims of voicemail interceptions were made aware of:
“The interference with their right to respect for private life that may have occurred;
“The possibility of continuing threats, where such threats had been identified;
“The steps they might take to protect their privacy; and
“Following the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against Glenn Mulcaire and 
Clive  Goodman,  the  identity  of  those  whom  the  police  believed  to  be  primarily 
responsible for the interception.
“Such steps should have included informing the public generally, by announcements 
in  the  media,  through  the  mobile  telephone  companies,  or  otherwise  (and  should 
have included, where appropriate, individual notification.”

11.17  The  declaration  came  before  the  court  (Gross  LJ  and  Irwin  J)  for  approval.  Given  the 
circumstances (namely a desire by both parties, for their own reasons, to settle the claim, 
together with the absence of argument as to the law), the Court made the agreed declaration 
but, at the same time, directed that it had no value as a precedent for future cases.

644 A claim for judicial review cannot proceed unless the Administrative court grants permission to proceed. Permission 
will only be granted where the claimants are able to demonstrate that they have an arguable case for seeking relief by 
way of judicial review

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE12.	 Conclusions:	the	police	and	the	CPS

2006 to 2007

12.1 

The police
I am entirely satisfied that the officers who worked on Operation Caryatid approached their 
task with complete integrity and that each of the decisions taken during the investigation and 
prosecution was appropriate, justified and in keeping with the operational imperatives of the 
police at that time. I have no doubt that neither Peter Clarke nor any of the other officers 
were or would have been affected by any relationships between some senior officers and 
NI personnel. There is no evidence that the relevant officers approached the task from the 
standpoint of seeking to deal with any alleged wrongdoers other than properly and so as to 
bring the force of the law to bear.

12.2  Furthermore, I find no evidence of compromise to the independence of the police officers 
engaged on Operation Caryatid who were prepared to follow evidence as far as it went but 
were equally mindful of other operational imperatives. Given how little was known about 
voicemail interception when the investigation began in December 2005 and the challenges 
involved  in  understanding  how  the  interceptions  were  taking  place  and  then  proving  the 
interceptions,  it  could  only  have  been  (and  was)  a  robust,  tenacious,  well-motivated  and 
skilful team that achieved such extensive evidence that Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire 
were driven to admit their guilt. Important convictions followed, this criminality was brought 
to the attention of the public and mobile phone companies were prompted to improve their 
security systems.

12.3  There is equally no doubt that the decision made in or around late September 2006 by Peter 
Clarke not to expand the investigation was wholly justified given the threat from terrorism 
and the enormous counter terrorism operations then in play (to say nothing of other serious 
crime the investigation of which would be under-staffed because of the demands of such 
investigations). In my judgment, there is simply no scope for concluding that the decision was 
in any way influenced by pressure from, fear of, or any personal relationships with, employees 
of NI or the NoTW.

12.4  That  is,  however,  only  the  start  of  the  matter.  Having  decided,  albeit  for  irreproachable 
reasons, not to investigate journalists other than Clive Goodman, it was imperative that the 
reasons for the decision were fully and accurately recorded and, furthermore, that the police 
devise,  institute  and  execute  a  suitable  strategy  to  deal  with  the  many  unresolved  issues 
surrounding the investigation. It is unnecessary to say more about the former (although it 
might have assisted years later when the Operation came to be revisited). As to the latter, the 
police rightly identified that potential victims of voicemail interception needed to be informed 
and it was intended to devise a proportionate and cost-effective strategy. Unfortunately, at 
almost every turn, the strategy devised was not fit for purpose; neither did it succeed.

12.5  First,  the  strategy  was  insufficiently  thought  out.  Its  formulation  did  not  even  encompass 
everyone identified in the blue book. It was intended that those whose voicemail boxes had 
been rung by the “suspect numbers” would be informed. The strategy therefore overlooked 
those  identified  in  the  blue  book  whose  voicemail  boxes  may  have  been  infiltrated  by  a 
journalist other than Mr Goodman. It also overlooked those whose voicemail boxes had been 

415

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid Eaccessed by the suspect numbers but at such an early date that the phone companies no 
longer retained the relevant records.

12.6  Second, the police did not make the phone companies aware (sufficiently or, probably at all) of 
the role that it was intended for them to play; neither did the police obtain their agreement to 
undertake such a role. It was simply assumed that, having been asked to identify any customers 
whose voicemail boxes had been called by the suspect numbers, the phone companies would 
naturally inform all those that they identified. Further, despite proceeding on this assumption, 
no steps at all appear to have been taken to check that the phone companies had carried out 
the task as anticipated. Although the investigating officers knew that there was an enormous 
body of material seized from Glenn Mulcaire which pointed towards large scale collection of 
information about mobile phones, PINs and other personal details, no sufficient thought was 
given to what impact that material had on the issue of warning victims or potential victims.

12.7 

It  is  entirely  understandable  that,  as  more  and  more  has  emerged,  concern  has  been 
increasingly  expressed  that  the  MPS  was  protecting  the  NoTW  for  it  was  the  reputation 
of that paper that benefited from the targeted focus of the investigation and the fact that 
only a small number of potential victims were notified of the facts. In the same way that 
I have no doubt that the decision to limit the scope of the investigation was not linked to 
any relationship with NI, I am similarly sure that the failure either to devise or to execute an 
appropriate strategy was not influenced in any way by, or connected to, any inappropriate 
relationship between the MPS and NI.

12.8  Third, the exit strategy ought also to have given some thought to advising senior management 
at  the  NoTW  and  NI,  about  their  position  and  the  reasons  for  the  curtailment  of  the 
investigation not least so that management could consider whether (and if so, what) steps 
should be taken to improve corporate governance in this area. In truth, in the light of the 
stance taken by the NoTW over a period of years, it is likely that nothing would have been 
done and police concern would have been dismissed. When NI and the NoTW declared that 
there was just “one rogue reporter”, however, consideration should have been given to the 
extent to which silence on the part of the MPS provided implicit support for the claim. At 
this distance of time and with so much more now known, it is difficult to know what could or 
should have been done. As it was, the issue was not even considered.

The response of NI to the prosecution and allegations of 
widespread criminality within the News of the World

12.9  NI  failed  to  carry  out  a  proper  internal  investigation  into  what  had  emerged  from  the 
prosecution  or  into  the  allegations  made  by  Mr  Goodman  when  appealing  against  his 
dismissal. Apart from a review of emails sent or received by the individuals named by Mr 
Goodman,  the  investigation  was  limited  to  Mr  Cloke  and  Mr  Myler  asking  the  individuals 
concerned whether there was any substance to the allegations and accepting at face value 
their  denials.  There  was  no  detailed  analysis  of  precisely  what  Mr  Mulcaire  had  done  to 
justify the enormous sums that he had been paid and no sign that the NoTW was concerned 
with anything other than further damage to its reputation or that it regarded the fact that 
criminal conduct may have flourished as a significant risk either from a corporate governance 
or operational perspective.

12.10  Despite the inadequacy of the internal enquiries that were conducted and despite the belief 
held  by  Mr  Crone  that  it  was  inaccurate  to  assert  the  “one  rogue  reporter”  defence,  NI 
maintained publicly that Mr Goodman acted alone. The episode was viewed as an aberration, 

416

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEinvolving  one  journalist  and  it  was  maintained  that  a  “full,  rigorous  internal  inquiry”  was 
being carried out. Rather than face and tackle the problem, the title followed its wish simply 
to “draw a line” under it the entire affair and hope that it all went away.

12.11  Even  when  Mr  Silverleaf  QC  advised  that  there  was  powerful  evidence  of  a  culture  of 
illegal  information  access  used  to  produce  stories  for  publication,  there  was  no  internal 
investigation.  Rupert  and  James  Murdoch  claimed  that  there  had  been  a  cover  up  to 
which senior management had been victim. If that was right, then the accountability and 
governance systems at NI would have to be considered to have broken down in an extremely 
serious respect. Both Mr Myler and Mr Crone strongly denied that there had been a cover 
up. Whatever the truth, there was serious failure of governance within the NoTW. Given the 
criminal investigation and what are now the impending prosecutions, it is simply not possible 
to go further at this stage. In any event, what can be said is that there was a failure on the part 
of the management at the NoTW to drill down into the facts to answer the myriad of questions 
that could have been asked and which could be encompassed by the all embracing question 
(whether or not it was in fact asked) “what the hell was going on?” This is a significant finding 
in the context of the practices of this newspaper at least; whether it can now be said by the 
press generally that it was a case of ‘one rogue newspaper’ is another matter.

2009 to 2011

News International

12.12  NI, through Colin Myler, reacted to the Guardian article by going on the attack, labelling the 
allegations in a letter to the PCC to be unsubstantiated, irresponsible and wholly false. Before 
the PCC and the CMS Committee, NI maintained the stance that there was no evidence that 
any member of staff at the NoTW had been involved in voicemail interception other than Mr 
Goodman. The determination of NI to maintain a line that, at the very least, the legal director 
believed was not true (and in which, at the very least, the editor, Mr Myler could not be said 
to have had confidence) in the face of two investigations by the CMS Committee and two 
investigations by the PCC is extraordinary and, at the very least, a demonstration of loyalty to 
the NoTW and its reputation which says a great deal about the culture of the paper (to say 
nothing of its practices and its approach to ethical propriety). In fact, the NoTW maintained 
the “one rogue reporter” defence until the Spring of 2011 when three NoTW journalists were 
arrested as part of Operation Weeting.

Police

12.13  Between July 2009 and January 2011, the failure to reopen Operation Caryatid (or at the very 
least to conduct a proper scoping exercise to decide whether it should be reopened) can be 
reduced into five overlapping errors. These are:

(a) 

(b) 

In  reality,  Mr  Yates  failed  adequately  to  address  any  question  other  than  whether 
there  was  anything  in  the  newspaper  reports  that  constituted  “new  evidence”.  This 
was notwithstanding the fact that a vast amount of documentation available from the 
August 2006 seizures had not been fully analysed by the MPS itself; very little of it had 
been considered (let alone reviewed) by the CPS, save only for the very limited exercise 
of disclosure of unused material.
There  was  a  failure  correctly  to  assimilate  the  admittedly  nuanced  advice  given  by 
counsel  in  August  2006  as  to  the  likely  interpretation  of  s1  of  RIPA,  and,  probably 

417

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid E(c) 

(d) 

because of a misunderstanding, it was later misrepresented.
There was a mischaracterisation of the evidence which had been provisionally reviewed 
in  August/September  2006  as  amounting  to  “no  evidence”  either  of  other  criminal 
offences or as implicating other potential defendants or, alternatively, if it was thought 
that there was evidence but only insufficient to prosecute, to consider whether, in the 
light of the Guardian’s article, that approach continued to be correct.
There  was  a  failure  to  appreciate  that  the  determinative  reason  for  closing  the 
investigation  down  in  September  2006  was  not  the  quality  of  the  evidence  but  an 
operational  assessment  of  competing  demands  on  the  resources  of  SO13  and  the 
impact  of  counter  terrorism  generally  and  the  limited  comparative  value  in  further 
pursuing the matter compared to the input that would have been required.

(e)  No assessment was made of the impact of the revelations emanating from the Guardian 
and the New York Times other than in a defensive frame of mind that the decisions 
taken in 2006 had to be correct (not least because Peter Clarke had made them).

12.14  I am not in doubt that the reaction of the MPS to the Guardian article published on 8 and 
9 July 2009 was wholly inadequate. For Mr Yates to treat this well-researched piece as ‘just 
another newspaper article’ is wholly at odds with the immediate reaction of others; outside 
the police service, they included the Home Secretary, Parliament, the DPP and, incidentally, 
the PCC. Whereas I do not believe that Mr Yates was, in fact, influenced in his decision-making 
by his friendship with Mr Wallis, given the reference to “suppressed evidence”, the fact that 
the MPS had not alerted all those whose phones were targeted and the fact that a targeted 
(albeit comparatively limited) prosecution had been pursued, it was a serious misjudgement 
to accept responsibility for making a decision affecting the NoTW (particularly one in favour 
of doing nothing) knowing he was a personal friend of the deputy editor. It did not need to be 
him who considered the allegations: it could have been any senior officer.

12.15  To make matters worse, Mr Yates dismissed the allegations made by the Guardian in a matter 
of hours. He did not give DCS Williams any real opportunity to refresh his memory as to the 
nuances of what had been a comparatively complex investigation which had concluded just 
short of three years beforehand. Neither did he wait for the documents to be retrieved from 
storage. Further, he did not engage with the substance of the allegations or scrutinise the 
information he was given. At the very least, he accepted at face value that there had been 
“no evidence” that journalists other than Mr Goodman had been involved in the criminality 
and that what leads there might have been were no longer viable. This approach is explained 
entirely by the inappropriately dismissive, defensive and closed-minded attitude he adopted 
from the outset.

12.16  Then,  having  reached  his  dogmatic  conclusion  on  9  July  2009,  he  closed  his  mind  to  the 
question of whether there might be material in police possession that could justify reopening 
the investigation and clung over-tenaciously to the shibboleth “no new evidence”. Operation 
Varec in 2010, (following the article in the New York Times) took the same path. The only 
steps taken were aimed at obtaining “new evidence”, including seeking interviews with those 
to whom the article referred, requesting material from the New York Times and other titles 
and information from NoTW reporters: there was no question even of scoping the exercise of 
looking at the material that had been in the possession of the police for four years. Even as late 
as January 2011, Mr Yates was warning the DPP of the risk of presentational embarrassment 
to both the MPS and the CPS if matters were re-opened. Unfairly and tendentiously he was 
placing  both  organisations  in  the  same  boat,  when  plainly  they  were  occupying  different 
vessels. Even to this day, Mr Yates maintains that it was the provision of new information by 
NI in January 2011 which warranted the reopening of the investigation and nothing before.

418

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE12.17  The judgment of DCS Williams was also clouded by his defensiveness. He did not see beyond 
the need to rebut the suggestion of a police cover-up. Rather than conducting a thorough 
review of his decision-making, DCS Williams simply adopted the position that there was “no 
evidence” to implicate any other journalists without making clear that although there had not 
been sufficient evidence to charge any other journalists, there was circumstantial evidence 
that had generated further lines of enquiry and therefore that the Guardian was right to the 
extent that there was material in police possession that could have been acted upon. There 
was simply no reason for not, at any time, providing the explanation that this additional work 
was not undertaken because of an operational decision essentially consequent upon intense 
counter terrorism duties.

12.18  Having  said  that,  I  must  make  it  clear  that  I  accept  entirely  that  DCS  Williams  was  acting 
entirely in good faith; he did not hide evidence or intend to mislead Mr Yates. At its highest, 
he mischaracterised what was available and mis-recollected or misunderstood the effect of 
the legal advice which had been received. Furthermore, although he secured the documents 
from storage and reviewed the position over the following days, after the press announcement 
which Mr Yates made on the day of the Guardian report, in reality, a defensive mindset had 
been engaged and there was no prospect of that decision being revisited.

12.19  I must also make clear that I find no evidence to suggest that DCS Williams was influenced in 
any way by the fact that the object of this investigation had been the NoTW. As he had done 
in 2006, if required, he would have been fully prepared to pursue any investigation as far as it 
could be taken. Neither is there any question of his seeking to curry favour with the press or 
of him having regard to what might have been considered the overly close social relationships 
of some senior officers with senior members of the press. Having acquitted Mr Yates of being 
affected by the relationship, there is nothing even to base an allegation of that nature against 
DCS Williams: I do not impugn the integrity of DCS Williams in any way.

12.20  There is no doubt that the manner in which the MPS remained implacable in the face of 
increasingly strident allegations in the press and demonstrated an unwillingness to revisit 
the investigation fuelled a legitimate concern that influence was at work. It is not surprising 
that in the years that have followed there should have developed a belief that relationships 
between NI and senior figures within the MPS had become so inappropriately close that the 
integrity of decision-making by the MPS could not be trusted. Public concern would have 
been reinforced by the ill-judged article written by Mr Hayman and published in the Times 
on 11 July 2009. He gave the impression, no doubt inadvertently but undeniably, that he was 
being deployed by NI to give support to the police line which, itself, was in support of NI. It 
was also not surprising that the claim for judicial review should follow.

The CPS

12.21  The conduct of the CPS and counsel in relation to the prosecution of Clive Goodman and 
Glenn Mulcaire cannot be criticised. In the light of the material provided by the police, they 
advised  on  an  entirely  appropriate  strategy  of  targeted  prosecution  which  was  pursued 
effectively to conviction. Analysis of unused material for the purposes of disclosure in that 
case did not involve any assessment of whether others at the NoTW should be investigated or 
prosecuted and there is no suggestion that they were asked to review the Mulcaire material 
to advise on whether further investigations should be pursued. That, as I have made clear, 
was an operational decision for the police.

12.22  Between  July  2009  and  January  2011,  the  DPP  approached  successive  revelations  in  the 
media with an ever open mind and ever-increasing frustration. Quite properly, he took the 

419

Chapter 4 | Phone  Hacking: The Expanding Impact of Operation Caryatid EGuardian  article  of  July  2009  seriously  and  commissioned  appropriate  internal  enquiries. 
Given  the  allegation  that  the  CPS  had  not  pursued  all  possible  charges  those  enquiries 
naturally focused on the material with which the CPS had been provided and the decisions 
that prosecutors had been required to make. Going further, however, the CPS in general and 
the DPP in particular were hampered by the fact that all relevant key personnel had since left 
the CPS. The inevitable diminution of memories by the lapse of time, not surprisingly made 
them reliant on briefing notes from the MPS and the review was not assisted by the failure to 
examine witness statements and exhibits from the prosecution. It was, however, correct to 
conclude that the original prosecution had been conducted properly.

12.23  It was difficult for the DPP to go behind the note prepared by counsel that they were told 
that  there  was  no  evidence  connecting  Glenn  Mulcaire  to  other  journalists  but  the  press 
release (“I am not in a position to say whether the police had any information on any other 
victims or suspects that was not passed to the CPS”) was entirely fair. He reacted to the “for 
Neville” email swiftly and, in the circumstances, reviewing the matter on 20/21 July 2009, 
it is not surprising that Mr Starmer needed urgent advice from Mr Perry. In that regard, it is 
unfortunate that Mr Perry did not request further time in order to re-acquaint himself with 
the relevant facts and law before advising, and that the resultant product did not accurately 
reflect the advice he had  given in  August 2006. In reality, however, this  made little  or no 
difference to the subsequent course of events.

12.24  The further allegations in the New York Times caused the DPP to re-evaluate the legal advice: 
he was then put on the right track. Given what the police placed before the CPS in relation 
to Operation Varec, the decision as to prosecution was inevitable. In January 2011, following 
the revelations arising from the civil claim brought by Sienna Miller, Mr Starmer reached the 
point where nothing less than a full review would reassure him that all relevant evidence had 
been acted on appropriately: that, again, was entirely the correct approach.

12.25  I conclude by endorsing the position as articulated by Mr Godwin during his evidence:646

“… the police are in a unique position because they’re an institution that can be called 
upon to investigate any other part of the establishment machinery, if you like, at any 
time, so in a sense they have to stand slightly apart, and that psychological distance 
between other institutions and the police.
“That doesn’t mean to say you can’t have completely cordial relations and high quality 
engagement with other professions or institutions, but at the same time I think the 
police are that organisation who can sometimes be called upon to investigate, and 
therefore the need for transparency, the need for accountability, is very high, quite 
properly, and I wasn’t entirely convinced some of those risks were identified …”

Introduction
Operation Weeting commenced on 26 January 2011. Its immediate spur was the provision 
to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) by News International (NI) of what the MPS has 
characterised  as  significant  new  information  relating  to  allegations  of  phone  hacking  at 
the  News  of  the  World  (NoTW)  in  2005-2006.1  Its  remit  was  initially  to  investigate  these 
allegations, but evidence relating to other dates and print titles is now being considered. The 
operation falls under the aegis of the Specialist Crime Directorate (SCD) of the MPS, and at all 
material times until 31 October 2012 has been headed by DAC Sue Akers, head of organised 
crime and criminal networks with the SCD, who has received universal praise for her work. 
DAC Akers also headed Operations Elveden and Tuleta.

Operation Elveden began on 20 June 2011 following the MPS being handed by NI a number of 
documents containing evidence relating to alleged inappropriate payments to a small number 
of police officers by journalists at the NoTW in exchange for confidential information.2 Since 
its early stages however, the ambit of Operation Elveden has widened significantly: additional 
print titles are now being investigated, as well as a range of public officials.3

Operation Tuleta commenced as a scoping exercise in June 2011 to consider the possibility 
of  investigating  allegations  of  computer  hacking  at  the  NoTW  falling  outside  the  remit  of 
Operations Elveden and Tuleta.4 In due course it became a fully-fledged investigation, and 
again its scope has broadened considerably.

DAC Akers attended the Inquiry on 6 and 27 February, and 23 July 2012, to provide updates 
as to the current status of these three operations. On each occasion she helpfully provided 
a witness statement which she elaborated in oral evidence.5 On 31 October 2012 DAC Akers 
filed a fourth witness statement which brings the position as up to date as it can be.6 She 
was not asked to give oral evidence in line with that statement. This section of the Report is 
heavily based on her evidence, as well as other material which is in the public domain.

Operation Weeting
As at 6 February 2012 there were 90 officers including support staff dedicated to Operation 
Weeting; of these, approximately 35 worked full time in relation to notifying and supporting 
the victims.7 As DAC Akers has explained in evidence, in its initial phases Operation Weeting 
focused  on  seeking  to  notify  the  victims  and  on  analysing  the  numerous  pages  of  the 
Mulcaire notebooks,8 which had been seized as part of Operation Caryatid on 8 August 2006.9 
Subsequently, however, Operation Weeting acquired possession of substantial quantities of 
email data from a variety of sources.10 In due course, the MPS was provided with the content 
of NI’s main server from 2005, containing a vast number of permanently deleted emails.11 
Officers working on Operation Weeting have been able to complete the reconstruction of 
these  deleted  emails  recovered  from  storage  devices  obtained  from  NI,  restoring  three 
hundred million emails. DAC Akers has informed the Inquiry that:12

“…we’ve rebuilt – experts have rebuilt material that we thought had been lost, and 
that  was  completed  towards  the  end  of  November  last  year.  So  we’re  now  going 
through that material.” 

The first arrest carried out under Operation Weeting was in April 2011, and the last (to date) 
at the end of August 2012. So far, 25 people13 have been arrested in connection with phone 
hacking, ten of whom are non-journalists. 17 individuals have been arrested for conspiring 
to intercept communications and/or in relation to the substantive offence. Of these, seven 
former  NoTW  employees  have  been  charged  with  an  overarching,  general  offence  of 
conspiracy to intercept communications, and an additional former employee has also been 
charged with a number of date-specific substantive offences. A provisional court date has 
been fixed for 9 September 2013. Of the 17 arrested, six individuals have been released from 
police bail with no further action taken; the remaining three individuals remain on police bail 
for conspiracy offences.14

It is clear that Operation Weeting has expended a considerable amount of police manpower 
and resource. It is also clear that its work has not finished.

Eight individuals have been arrested for perverting the course of justice: this operation has 
been named Operation Sacha. Seven of these have been charged with conspiring to commit 
that offence, and have been sent to the Crown Court for trial. A hearing for the defendants’ 
applications to dismiss is scheduled for 12 and 13 December 2012.15

Operation Elveden
In February 2012 there were 40 police officers and staff working on Operation Elveden and the 
MPS was in the process of increasing this to 61.16 The investigation has entailed going through 
large quantities of NI business records and emails, seeking evidence relevant to suspicious 
payments.  As  of  26  October  2012  a  total  of  52  individuals  had  been  arrested  by  officers 
working  on  Operation  Elveden;  of  these,  25  are  current  and  former  journalists  (including 
journalists from The Sun; the Daily Mirror and its sister paper, the Sunday Mirror; and the 
Daily  Star  Sunday).17  The  arrests  made  thus  far  under  Operation  Elveden  are  for  offences 
under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to 
commit these offences, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, money laundering 
contrary to s328 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and bribery contrary to s1 of the Bribery 
Act 2010;18 the gravamen of the allegations being that they offered money to public officials 
in exchange for stories. As at 26 October 2012 files had been submitted to the CPS to advise 
on appropriate charges for three public officials and four current and former journalists.19

1.10 

In an important piece of evidence, DAC Akers pointed out that offences20 of this nature are 
suspected to have been committed in at least three separate newspaper titles right up to 
early 2012.21 DAC Akers expects further arrests to be made in due course.22

Operation Tuleta

1.11  Operation Tuleta began with an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the hacking 
into computers of Ian Hurst by or at the instigation of NoTW journalists in 2006.23 As at October 
2012, Operation Tuleta was undertaking an assessment of 142 separate allegations of data 
intrusion, including allegations of phone hacking, computer hacking, and improper access to 
banking, medical and other personal records.24 This has entailed interrogating between 8-12 
terabytes of data across 70 different storage devices; a vast undertaking.25 

1.12 

In April 2012, officers working on Operation Tuleta discovered inconsistencies with regard to 
the origin of material they had received from the Management Standards Committee (MSC).26 
Some of the information provided by the MSC had been traced to material which appears to 
have been obtained from two stolen mobile phone devices. DAC Akers has said that:27

Chapter 5 | A New Approach to the AllegationsE“…it seems that on occasions we’ve found that material has been downloaded from 
and is in possession of News International titles which appear to have come from 
stolen  mobile  telephones.  It  appears  from  some  of  the  documentation,  and  that’s 
dated around late 2010, that one of the mobile phones has been examined with a 
view to breaking its code, its security code, so that the contents can be downloaded 
by experts.”

1.13  Officers  working  on  Operation  Tuleta  are  anticipating  the  identification  of  the  individuals 
responsible for the download of the content of these stolen devices, and are also seeking to 
establish whether the downloading of stolen data may have been a common practice at the 
other NI titles. DAC Akers has told the Inquiry that it is her firm intention to request further 
documentation from the MSC in respect of this discovery, with the purpose of establishing:28

“…whether in fact these are just isolated incidents or just the tip of an iceberg.”

1.14  As at 31 October 2012, 17 arrests had been made under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, 
and/or  in  respect  of  offences  of  handling  stolen  goods,  by  officers  working  on  Operation 
Tuleta.29 This figure includes a former Times journalist who, on 29 August 2012, was arrested 
by Operation Tuleta officers on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 
and conspiracy to pervert to course of justice.30 All these individuals are on police bail pending 
completion of the arrest phase and CPS advice on charging.31

1.15  As with Operations Weeting and Elveden, it is clear that there is considerable potential for 

further arrests of journalists, and not merely those previously employed by the NoTW.

2.	 The	Management	and	Standards	Committee
2.1 

Between 2007 and 2011, the approach to the containment of the issue of what had happened 
at the NoTW gradually unravelled. Payments to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire might have 
ensured their silence but a number of the victims were prepared to invest in legal proceedings 
both to learn precisely what had happened and to obtain redress. Very substantial further 
payments in settlement did not stem the tide and, although most of the press was entirely 
silent on the subject, the effect of the July 2009 story in the Guardian (quite apart from the 
approach of the police) was to generate enquiry in Parliament, press coverage in the New 
York Times and the fact (and yet further risk) of an exponential rise in litigation. 

2.2 

In the circumstances that have been described, the MPS grasped the nettle and re-opened 
the investigation; from the perspective of NI, containment was no longer an option because 
the reputational risk to News Corporation (News Corp) (let alone NI) required a complete 
change of direction. That came in the form of the Management and Standards Committee 
(MSC) and in July 2011, the board of News Corp appointed the distinguished UK commercial 
lawyer, Lord Grabiner QC, to the role of Chairman.

2.3 

Lord Grabiner’s appointment was made, at least in part, to help ensure the effective exchange 
of information between NI and the MPS, particularly with regard to the inquiry into alleged

police  payments  at  the  NoTW,  as  part  of  Operation  Elveden.32  Lord  Grabiner  reports  to 
Gerson Zweifach, Senior Executive Vice President and Group General Counsel of News Corp, 
who was himself appointed to that role in June 2012, taking over that previously held by Joel 
Klein, formerly Assistant Attorney General of the United States.33 Gerson Zweifach in turn 
reports to the independent directors on the News Corp Board through Professor Viet Dinh, an 
independent Director and Chairman of News Corp’s Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee, and also a former Assistant Attorney General.34 

In July 2011, two further NI executives (Will Lewis, formally editor-in-chief of the Telegraph 
Media Group and previously group General Manager at NI, and Simon Greenberg, previously 
Head of Corporate Affairs) resigned from their positions with NI in order to take up posts 
with the MSC. They have been appointed as full time MSC executive members. News Corp’s 
General Counsel for Europe and Asia, Jeff Palker, was appointed to the MSC as a part-time 
legal executive.35

The independence of the MSC from both NI and News Corp is one of its defining characteristics. 
This independence is ensured by requiring the MSC to operate its own governance structure, 
separate  to  that  of  News  Corp.  The  MSC  is  housed  and  operates  from  a  secure  unit  on 
NI’s  Wapping  site  in  London,  located  at  a  physical  distance  from  the  main  NI  building.36 
This  independence,  both  in  physical  and  figurative  forms,  is  critical  to  the  MSC’s  ability 
independently to investigate the allegations of wrongdoing at the NoTW, as well as at NI.

Terms of reference and remit
The MSC was established by News Corp with a role and remit to investigate allegations of 
criminality relating to phone hacking at the NoTW and other NI titles. Specifically, the MSC 
has been set up to investigate a number of matters including: allegations of phone hacking at 
the NoTW; allegations of illegal payments made by NI employees to public officials, including 
police officers; and all other related issues with regard to NI (including this Inquiry).37 The 
Committee has therefore played a role of fundamental importance to the ongoing criminal 
and other investigations into the allegations of wrongdoing at NI. The reason for this new 
approach  is  clear.  Quite  apart  from  issues  concerned  with  reputation,  the  United  States’ 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it illegal for any US company to pay bribes to overseas 
officials and News Corp (the corporate parent of News International) is incorporated in the 
USA. In the light of what had emerged in the UK, it is not surprising that while NI (and, to a 
lesser extent, News Corp) is subject to investigation in the UK, government and regulators 
in the USA have also been concerned to look at what had been happening. Rupert Murdoch 
told the Inquiry that News Corp (through the MSC) was therefore cooperating fully with the 
US Department of Justice.38 

2.7 

The UK investigations into allegations of phone hacking and payments to public officials are 
being led by the MPS. Operation Elveden, investigating the allegations of police corruption, 
has been operating under the supervision of the Independent Police Complaints Commission

(IPCC).39 The MPS investigations have focused on the UK subsidiary, NI, and although the MSC 
is cooperating with enforcement agencies in both the USA and the UK, the investigatory remit 
of the MSC is restricted to only NI titles and matters in the UK.40 The MSC has been authorised 
by the News Corp board to investigate practices through a process of internal review at the 
NI titles, namely The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times. It has also assisted in relation to 
the evidence gathering related to the NoTW.

As  well  as  the  Committee’s  investigatory  functions,  the  MSC  is  also  responsible  for 
recommending and overseeing the implementation of new policies and systems at NI titles. 
According to representatives of the MSC, the purpose of this role is to ensure that the highest 
standards of editorial practices are upheld in future at NI. This includes ensuring business at 
the newspaper titles, The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times, are underpinned by robust 
systems of governance and compliance, as well as a legal structure.41 The Inquiry has not 
heard any evidence in relation to such recommendations made by the MSC.

In addition, the MSC has also been given the authority to negotiate and settle any civil litigation 
in relation to phone hacking. As such it oversees the News International Compensation Scheme 
for victims in relation to voicemail hacking by the NoTW and it is right that full mention should 
be made of this willingness by NI to provide informal redress. The Scheme was announced by 
NI on 8 April 2011, following a public apology from the newspaper, their publishing company 
News Group Newspapers (NGN) as well as NI itself, for the actions of journalists involved 
in phone hacking at the NoTW.42 The Scheme was launched on 4 November 2011, with the 
solicitors, Olswang, being appointed to handle all victim-driven civil litigation in relation to 
voicemail hacking at the NoTW, along with administrative responsibilities in relation to the 
Scheme.43 Sir Charles Gray (formerly a High Court Judge and a very experienced media lawyer) 
was appointed as the adjudicator of the Scheme. As such, he has provided an independent 
assessment of any applications received for compensation claims made against NGN by those 
whose voicemails had allegedly been intercepted.44 

2.10  According to NI, the purpose of the Scheme is to offer an accessible and streamlined process 
for the victims of voicemail hacking, in order that they might obtain remedial action without 
the complexities that can be involved in the court process. The Scheme has also promised 
an  uplift  of  10%  in  respect  of  potential  payments,  based  on  what  victims  might  expect  if 
they successfully settled in the courts. The Scheme has advised potential victims of alleged 
voicemail hacking to contact the police team in Operation Weeting before applying to join the 
Scheme, so that the police can identify whether they have been revealed to have been a victim 
as part of the investigation, thereby justifying a claim. NGN is responsible for reimbursing the 
costs incurred by the MPS in providing those who apply with appropriate disclosure; it also 
meets the legal advisory costs of any alleged victims joining the Scheme.45

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawECooperation with the police

2.11  The autonomy of the MSC has been the cornerstone of the collaboration between the MSC 
and all those working on the ongoing investigations into the allegations of wrongdoing at 
NI.46 In addition to the three overarching investigations being undertaken by the MPS, namely 
Operations Weeting, Elveden (under the supervision of the IPCC) and Tuleta, along with the 
subsidiary operations that are derived from those, there are the ongoing civil proceedings 
relating to phone hacking and data hacking and the Parliamentary hearings of the Culture, 
Media and Sport Select Committee.47 In this regard, in its 11th Report of Session 2010-12, 
that Committee commented on the cooperation of the MSC at the time of the Parliamentary 
investigation, praising:48 

“…the willingness of the newly-established Management and Standards Committee 
to  provide  the  Committee  with  unsolicited  copies  of  recently  unearthed  e-mail 
exchanges that are of relevance to the events under investigation”.

2.12  Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers has sought to explain to the Inquiry the nature 
and reality of the relationship between the MPS and the MSC. In particular, DAC Akers has 
praised  the  levels  of  assistance  and  cooperation  demonstrated  by  the  MSC,  as  well  as  its 
cooperation in providing information which has been requested by officers conducting the 
three MPS investigations. As an example of the cooperative approach of the MSC toward 
the MPS investigations, this has included the voluntary disclosure of potential evidence to 
Operation  Elveden,  gathered  as  part  of  the  MSC’s  internal  review  of  The  Sun.49  It  is  also 
perhaps illustrative of the MSC’s approach to the matters of investigation, that the Committee 
initiated  internal  reviews  of  The  Sun,  The  Times  and  The  Sunday  Times  without  specific 
requests from the MPS. 

2.13  To a certain extent, the MPS has been dependent on the cooperation of the MSC in relation to 
the disclosure of information; although cooperation is exactly what the police would expect 
from  any  corporate  body  where  evidence  of  criminality  has  been  revealed.  As  DAC  Akers 
explained to the Inquiry, however, because of the terms of the Police and Criminal Evidence 
Act 1984 (PACE) (as to which the Deputy Commissioner of the MPS has made submissions to 
the Inquiry), the MPS has not been in a position to force compliance. She stated that:50 

“…the legal advice that we’ve had has told us that whilst you have the co-operation 
of News International, as it is in this case, we must proceed by the way of protocol, 
and that’s what we’re doing. So it’s voluntary disclosure as opposed to applying for a 
production order through PACE”. 

2.14  To  date,  pursuant  to  requests  and  otherwise,  the  MSC  has  disclosed  large  amounts  of 
documentation  to  Operation  Elveden.  Evidence  obtained  through  the  analysis  of  some  of 
this documentation has already led to a number of arrests of journalists, as well as other

Chapter 5 | A New Approach to the AllegationsEstaff  at  The  Sun,  on  28  January  2012  and  11  February  2012.51  These  (and  other)  arrests 
since November 2011 have been highly publicised. Indeed, some of this coverage has led to 
complaints  from  current  journalists  at  The  Sun,  particularly  concerning  the  circumstances 
and scale of the arrests. By way of example, following the arrests on 11 February 2012, the 
associate editor of The Sun, Trevor Kavanagh, claimed that a disproportionately large number 
of police officers had been involved in the dawn arrests of journalists at their homes and in 
The Sun offices, representing a witch hunt and an attack on press freedom.52 

2.15 

In  response,  Ms  Akers  explained  that  the  fact  that  the  arrests  were  carried  out  without 
warning was in line with protocols for such investigations, with the primary goal being to 
secure evidence and prevent suspects from conferring or disposing of evidential material.53 
She  also  suggested  that  arrests  had  been  carried  out  in  a  manner  intended  to  minimise 
business disruption to the newspaper, noting that searches of The Sun offices were conducted 
on a Saturday, outside of business hours. She went on to state that:54 

“The purpose of police action to date has been proactively to investigate the alleged 
criminality  which  has  been  identified.  The  aim  has  never  been  to  threaten  the 
existence of The Sun. To this end there has been liaison with the MSC to take account 
of business risk to The Sun newspaper hence searches being made at The Sun offices 
on a Saturday when the office would be empty”. 

DAC Akers has acknowledged that this approach to the conduct of searches has since been 
changed, following the launch of The Sun on Sunday.

2.16  DAC Akers has also told the Inquiry that there was a time when the attitude of the MSC to 
the MPS changed somewhat. Following the arrests of 28 January 2012 and 11 February 2012, 
DAC Akers said that the approach of the MSC to the disclosure of evidence was different: 55

“We were being asked perhaps to justify our requests to a degree that we perhaps 
formerly hadn’t been, and the material that we were requesting was slower in being 
forthcoming”. 

2.17  This change of behaviour occurred at a time of increased publicity for both the MPS and the 
MSC, against a backdrop of threats of legal action against the MSC and also when changes 
were made to the senior personnel at the MSC,56 which might themselves have contributed 
to the different relationship between the MSC and the MPS. In this regard, she observed:57

“…those two arrest days, there was considerable adverse publicity of both the MPS, 
the police and the MSC, including threats of legal action against the MSC.”

commentators have complained is the true reason (rather than press misconduct) for the present Inquiry.

warrant during the course of Operation Caryatid, this may not be as surprising as otherwise it might seem.

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawE2.18  More specifically, DAC Akers has referred to a period in May 2012 when, for a number of 
weeks, the MSC temporarily halted the voluntary disclosure of material to the MPS.58 She 
reported to the Inquiry her understanding that the MSC had been considering their position 
in relation to the MPS operations during this hiatus59 and went on:60

“At the beginning, when we began the enquiries, all contact was through the lawyers; 
then these were other lawyers, Burton Copeland. Then Mr Lewis and Mr Greenberg 
were  introduced  to  help  facilitate  the  co-operation,  which  they  did.  And  in  mid-
May this year, following a development in our investigation, it caused the MSC to 
reconsider their position and they decided that they would prefer the meetings to be 
on a more formal basis with lawyers only”.

2.19  DAC Akers stressed the importance of full cooperation by the MSC to police operations, and 
commented that any change in the approach of the voluntary disclosure of evidence would: 
“…adversely affect initial decisions that we’d made and arrests that were made as well”.61 The 
disclosure of documentation by the MSC resumed in mid-June, following discussion between 
the MPS with Lord Grabiner and the legal team representing the MSC.62 Such consequences 
would undeniably have affected the extent to which NI could have argued that it had adopted 
a new approach to compliance with the criminal law.

2.20  At that same meeting, a new framework was agreed in relation to communication. This has 
involved  a  changed  format  to  meetings  between  the  MSC  and  MPS  teams,  and,  notably, 
the insistence on legal representation by the MSC while liaising with officers from the MPS 
operations.63 Further, a number of executive members of the MSC, including Will Lewis and 
Simon Greenberg, have been stood down from attending regular briefings between the two 
parties.64 Despite the change in process, DAC Akers was keen to make clear in evidence to the 
Inquiry that the professional approach of the MSC towards the MPS has been maintained and 
that the change “…hasn’t affected the co-operation, which is still very good”.65 

2.21  Since DAC Akers gave evidence in July, it is clear that some tensions have become apparent 
about the way in which the relationship between the MSC and the MPS has developed. I 
cannot resolve this issue and, for good reason, I am satisfied that it is not appropriate to 
elaborate or even to set out the respective positions. In the circumstances, I leave the matter 
there.

Chapter 5 | A New Approach to the AllegationsEThe approach of the MSC to disclosure

2.22  Material provided by the MSC is for the MPS to assess, evaluate and follow up as appropriate. 
The  MSC  has  made  clear  that  it  has  a  duty  to  protect  journalistic  sources  used  by  the  NI 
titles and it is careful to ensure that these are not compromised through disclosure.66 Where 
disclosed material might enable the identification of confidential but legitimate sources of 
information, the MSC has provided such documentation in redacted form. All such material 
has been categorised in order to determine whether and what redactions should apply.

2.23  To  this  end,  DAC  Akers  has  explained  the  detail  of  the  process  of  receiving  documents 
relating  to  the  allegations  of  alleged  payments  to  public  officials.  In  such  circumstances, 
documents which, in the first instance, have been redacted to remove confidential material, 
are provided to officers working on Operation Elveden. However, if, following this disclosure, 
the assessment of the evidence by the MPS provides a proper justification for identifying the 
source, the MSC will provide the information, this time in an unredacted form.67 

2.24 

In response to questions from Mr Jay, DAC Akers has sought to provide a sense of the scale and 
scope of the material disclosed by the MSC. She noted that this material related to allegations 
of  data  intrusion,  including  phone  hacking,  computer  hacking  and  the  illegal  accessing  of 
other personal data. Separately, it also contains material relevant to Operation Tuleta, which 
is  now  investigating  over  100  separate  allegations  of  data  intrusion.  The  documentation 
provided has been sourced from previous inquiries, as well as the review of 70 electronic 
storage devices which were seized during both Operations Weeting and Elveden.68 Ms Akers 
has  said  that  the  evidence  gathered  amounted  to  between  eight  and  twelve  terabytes  of 
data.69 

2.25  Material  of  real  significance  has  also  been  disclosed  by  the  MSC  to  officers  working  on 
Operation Elveden, which appears to indicate that not only were routine payments made to 
public officials by some journalists working at the NoTW but that similar payments had also 
been made by the employees of The Sun. These payments are alleged to have occurred on 
multiple occasions and included large payments in figures of thousands of pounds. In her oral 
evidence, DAC Akers said that:70

“There  also  appears  to  have  been  a  culture  at  the  Sun  of  illegal  payments,  and 
systems have been created to facilitate those payments, whilst hiding the identity of 
the officials receiving the money. The emails indicate that payments to sources were 
openly referred to within the Sun, in which case the source is not named, but rather 
the category “public official” is identified, rather than the name”.

2.26  The consequence of this disclosure by the MSC has led the police to the investigation of those 
to whom payments were made. This has revealed evidence to suggest that the practice of 
payments to public officials, including police officers, may have taken place at other titles 
outside the NI titles.71 In her evidence to the Inquiry in July 2012, Ms Akers said that the MPS

69 To provide context, Ms Akers described a terabyte of data, in terms that “…if downloaded in the form of a kind of 
normal-size paperback, which is then piled on top of one another, I’m told the terabyte amounts to three and a half times 
the height of Everest”. p12, lines 9-13, http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Transcript-of-

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEChapter 5  |  A New Approach to the Allegations

had identified potential payments to individuals related to prison officials, made by staff at 
both Trinity Mirror Group (TMG) and the Express News Group (the Express). The MPS now 
believes that a number of stories published in the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, the Daily 
Star  and  the  Star  on  Sunday,  were  obtained  through  such  payments.72  As  a  consequence 
of this disclosure, an employee of TMG and an employee of the Express were arrested by 
officers working on Operation Elveden. This has led the police to seek the assistance of both 
those groups, requesting evidential material relating to these arrests.73

2.27  Although not relevant to the MSC, it is appropriate here to note that TMG and the Express 
have  taken  different  approaches  to  the  requests  for  information  requests  from  the  MPS. 
Specifically, TMG has asked the MPS to obtain a production pursuant to PACE which it is said 
will not be opposed; the Express has stated that the company would be prepared voluntarily 
to share documents through an agreed system, similar to that operated by the MSC; at the 
time of Ms Akers’ evidence, no such protocol had been put in place.74

A critical view of the MSC

2.28  Although  the  MSC  operates  independently  of  NI  and  News  Corp,  its  independence  has 
not gone unchallenged by some witnesses to the Inquiry. Brian Paddick, a former Deputy 
Assistant Commissioner of the MPS, has raised doubts over the ability of the MSC to conduct 
an  impartial  and  transparent  investigation.  The  fact  that  News  Corp  was  responsible  for 
the establishment of the MSC has led Mr Paddick to believe that the MSC was potentially 
susceptible to the influence of News Corp executives and staff, and that this alleged influence 
may have an impact on both its investigations and cooperation with the MPS.75

e

2.29  Mr  Paddick  also  explained  his  lack  of  faith  in  the  credibility  in  the  system  of  disclosure. 
He  expressed  concerns  that  the  MSC  might  withhold  potential  evidence  from  the  MPS, 
particularly as the disclosure of material is voluntary, noting that reliance has been placed on 
cooperation rather than a production order sought pursuant to the legislative powers set out 
in PACE.76 Commenting specifically on the disclosure of evidence by the MSC in relation to the 
internal review of the practices at The Sun, Mr Paddick said that:77

 “The difficulty is – and as she (Sue Akers) is saying, for example, all the issues that 
we’ve had around the Sun newspaper she never asked for. It’s been volunteered by 
this committee. What information are they not volunteering that Sue Akers is not 
aware of?”

He also suggested that the MSC had an advantage in so far that it was potentially able to 
withhold material from the MPS investigations, by claiming journalistic privilege:78

“...whilst it’s maybe ... it is independent of News International, it’s not independent 
of the parent company, as it were… …requests are put in to this committee by the 
police. If that committee decides that actually, as far as they’re concerned, there’s no 
criminal implications, that it is subject to journalistic privilege, then that committee 
does not reveal the information that the police are asking for.”

2.30  Mr Paddick has also criticised the lead role of the MPS in the investigations of allegations of 
corrupt payments made to police officers, as well as public officials. He expressed reservations 
at the putative neutrality of the MPS, explaining that he feared that public perceptions risked 
becoming skewed by the fact that the investigation into the alleged corruption of MPS officers 
was  being  conducted  by  the  very  police  force  under  investigation.  Although  Mr  Paddick 
made specific acknowledgement of the integrity of both DAC Akers and the Commissioner 
of the MPS, Mr Paddick has made clear that he remained concerned that the MPS could not 
objectively investigate alleged corruption within their own force. He has suggested that an 
external police force, one which was not implicated in the current investigations, should have 
been appointed independently to investigate the alleged wrongdoing which has taken place. 
He told the Inquiry that:79

“…some  people  may  not  be  convinced  by  the  current  arrangements  and  it  may 
be  better  if  it  was  an  outside  force  who  were  investigating,  purely  from  a  public 
perception point of view. But I am not in any way casting doubt on either Sue Akers’ 
integrity, nor the head of the MSC…”

2.31  The suggestion was also raised during Mr Paddick’s oral evidence that it would be difficult to 
find an independent force with senior officers who did not have previous experience at the 
MPS, but Mr Paddick maintained that this could be achieved, and that it would be better in 
terms of public perception if the MPS were unaffiliated with the investigation. He said:80

“…it is possible to find ACPO officers who have no previous history with the Metropolitan 
Police who could lead up this investigation. Whether they would be better at it, I don’t 
know, but in terms of public perception, I’m saying that it might be better.”

2.32  Mr Paddick has also voiced concerns at the risk of collusive behaviour between the MPS and 
NI. Specifically, he was concerned at what could happen should the MPS investigations, or the 
MSC reviews of the NI titles, uncover evidence which placed either party in an unfavourable 
position in the public eye. He explained his concerns using a hypothetical example:81

“…perhaps  somebody  very  senior  in  the  Metropolitan  Police  is  seen  to  be  having 
received inappropriate payments from somebody very senior in News International, 
how it might be in the interests of Rupert Murdoch or News Corp and in the interests 
of the Metropolitan Police for that not to be made public.”

2.33  Mr Paddick suggested that it may be possible for the MPS and NI to work together to disguise 
or hide incriminating evidence in order to protect the reputation of either organisation. In his 
response to questions from Counsel to the MPS, Neil Garnham QC, Mr Paddick remained of 
the view that he had “…difficulty in having complete confidence” in the MPS investigations for 
the reasons he has elucidated.82 Although Mr Garnham was at pains to address a number of

PART E | Crossing Legal Boundaries: the Criminal and Civil LawEexternal factors which would prevent such collusion, including oversight of Operation Elveden 
by the IPCC, Mr Paddick insisted that the investigation:83

“…should be led by a senior office from another force who has had no previous service 
with the Metropolitan Police.”

He also expressed his concerns about the independence of the IPCC but did not elaborate 
further.

2.34  DAC  Akers  has  also  addressed  the  concerns  raised  by  Mr  Paddick,  by  emphasising  the 
fundamental importance of the professional and productive relationship the MPS has built 
with the MSC. She stressed that the independence of the MSC from NI and the structure it 
operates within:84 

“…goes  a  long  way  to  allay  some  criticisms  that  have  been  made  about  how  it’s 
perceived that it can’t be necessarily an independent inquiry. The fact that we are 
dealing with the MSC directly and not News International I think should make any 
contention that it isn’t independent without foundation.” 

2.35  As testament to the important contribution that the MSC has made to the investigation, DAC 
Akers noted that, as at the date of her fourth witness statement, namely 31 October 2012, 
the disclosure of material to Operation Elveden had led to the arrest of 25 journalists out of a 
total of 52 arrests; this was in addition to 25 arrests made as part of Operation Weeting and 
17 arrests as part of Operation Tuleta.85

2.36 

In forming a view about these matters, I am primarily reliant on the evidence provided by DAC 
Akers (about whom nobody has spoken other than in terms of the highest praise) although I 
also have professional experience of Lord Grabiner and knowledge of his high standing as an 
independent barrister in England and Wales. Furthermore, I am able to draw inferences from 
the nature and extent of what has happened as events have unfolded. On the other hand, 
there has been no evidence to support the concerns raised by Mr Paddick, either as to the 
independence of the MSC or to the impartiality and integrity of the MPS officers responsible 
for the conduct of its investigation into alleged police corruption and other crime.

2.37  The purpose of the MSC has been to re-establish (or establish) a reputation in NI as a company 
that takes its obligations to the law very seriously and is determined to root out criminality 
wherever it has existed and whomever it has involved, albeit recognising that some difficult 
decisions might have to be made in relation to journalistic privilege. In the light of events, 
neither News Corp nor NI can do less if the purpose is to be achieved. It is obviously important 
that News Corp, NI and the MSC continue in the resolve that has now been shown. 

2.38 

I ought to make it clear that I am not at all critical of Mr Paddick for raising these concerns 
which I have no doubt are legitimate and ventilated in good faith, based on the history of this 
investigation and seared by his own experience both of NI and the MPS. For my part, however, 
I am fully satisfied as to the way in which the police are now conducting this investigation 
(to which considerable resources have been devoted doubtless because of the reputational 
damage that the MPS has suffered) and as to the integrity of the officers involved.

Chapter 5 | A New Approach to the AllegationsE2.39  Equally, albeit without resolving the present differences between the MPS and the MSC, I have 
seen no evidence to undermine the view expressed by DAC Akers as to the independence of 
the MSC and its effectiveness as an independent arbiter in accordance with its remit. I am 
satisfied  that  sufficient  safeguards  (by  way  of  protocols  and  otherwise)  have  been  put  in 
place to dispel legitimate concerns along the lines that he has raised. 

Findings and progress of the MSC

2.40  On 1 May 2012, the MSC announced the completion of its internal reviews of the three NI 
titles,  that  is  to  say  The  Times,  The  Sunday  Times  and  The  Sun.86  Rupert  Murdoch,  in  an 
address to NI staff, has been quoted in relation to the findings of the reviews of The Times 
and The Sunday Times, saying there was:87

“…no evidence of illegal conduct other than a single incident reported months ago”. 

This  single  incident  is  thought  to  refer  to  the  activities  of  the  former  Times  journalist  in 
relation to gaining unlawful access to one or more personal emails.

2.41  No  further  details  have  been  announced  in  relation  to  findings  of  the  internal  review  of 
The  Sun.  Neither  has  the  MSC  released  further  documentation  to  the  MPS  following  the 
completion of its review of The Sun. DAC Akers put the matter in this way:88 

“…the MSC would say the result of the review was the material that they had disclosed 
to us, but we haven’t received or -- I understand there is no formal report as a result 
of their review.”

Neither has the Inquiry heard any evidence in relation to the findings of the reviews conducted 
by the MSC. In the light of the quantity of evidence that has emerged from these titles and 
the evidence of DAC Akers, no further information has been sought. 

2.42 

In the meantime, the MSC has also begun to implement governance reforms in the newspaper 
titles at NI. These reforms include improving policies relating to anti-bribery, whistleblowing 
and payments. These changes have been implemented through the office of Gerson Zweifach 
and appropriate information relating to them has been disseminated to employees and staff 
at NI.89 The Inquiry has not heard any evidence relating to these specific reforms by the MSC, 
although Thomas Mockridge, Chief Executive Officer of NI, informed the Inquiry in October 
2011 that:90 

“…it is appropriate that compliance within NI be strengthened immediately. I have 
therefore not waited for the output of the reviews... I have implemented, or am in the 
process of implementing, new policies… Current policies, practices and systems may 
be adjusted later in line with the findings of the reviews.” 

2.43  Finally, it is worth noting the costs of the MSC to NI have been borne by the UK subsidiary 
rather than by News Corp. From the Group Report and Financial Statement, as at 8 May 2012,

excluding any costs relating to the News International Compensation Scheme or ongoing civil 
litigation, the MSC has cost NI £53.2 million. These costs have been accrued primarily in legal 
and professional fees since July 2011.91 It is likely that, by the time of publication, these costs 
will have increased further.
