This inquiry, commonly referred to by the name of its chair, Lord Justice Leveson, was commissioned by the British government in 2011, in response to accusations of widespread criminal activity by the British press, corruption in the police and the failure of politicians to act against this behaviour. Journalists had been hacking into the phones of public figures, allegedly on the instruction of senior newspaper staff. A preliminary police investigation into criminal activity at News International in 2007 was also suspected of misconduct.

The inquiry found that the existing Press Complaints Commission was ineffective and recommended the creation of a more robust, independent regulatory body which newspapers could voluntarily enrol in, where those that did not could thenceforth be ordered to pay punitive damages in civil cases.
